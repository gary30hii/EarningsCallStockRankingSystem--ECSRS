At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. \nJ. Hansen: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas' Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Schneider, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer your questions.\n The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which would cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.\n I'll now turn the call over to Scott Farmer. \nScott Farmer: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As you know, this continues to be a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our employees, who we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday.\n On May 13, we provided an update on how Cintas' business has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how we were managing the business. COVID-19 continues to be a significant disruption to our economy and to business. Our priorities are unchanged. They include keeping our employees healthy and safe and remaining committed to serving our customers in any way possible. I believe we're succeeding at both.\n Our employee partners have been consistent and diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services to health care facilities, pharmaceutical companies, grocery store chains, food processing plants and many others. We've provided health care customers with clean scrubs and microfiber towels and mats. We've provided tens of thousands of customers with disinfectant and sanitizer spray services. And we've provided tremendous amounts of personal protective equipment, including face masks, face shields and other items to our customers to keep their employees safe.\n Our supply chain has worked feverishly to satisfy this demand. The demand for items like hand sanitizers and N95 respirators has increased tenfold in this pandemic. Our existing suppliers around the world have been key to us meeting this demand, and we thank them for their support. In addition, our scale enabled us to establish additional relationships with dozens of vendors to secure these scarce products. We continue to work to aid existing customers with the products and services that they desperately need, and our ability to access these products that others can't has enabled us to win new customers. We continue to communicate with our customers who remain idled who are -- and are considered on hold, and our focus is on being there to help them when they reopen.\n Before turning the call back to Mike, I want to conclude by stating that I'm thankful for the tremendous dedication of our employee partners. I'm proud of their ability to adapt and persevere in the midst of unprecedented adversity. In addition, I'm as excited as ever about our principal objective of exceeding our customers' expectations to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for our shareholders and working partners. Our value proposition of getting businesses Ready for the Workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance arguably has never resonated more than it does today. This pandemic will not soon be forgotten, and its impact on society is likely transformative.\n We believe a new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. More health care scrubs are being professionally laundered and managed, so fewer are worn in public. Businesses, including universities and retail establishments, are requiring huge quantities of sanitizer and related services. Most businesses are providing larger budgets to align with proper cleaning protocols and supply chains of these key items are moving to the U.S. to reduce dependence on other nations. We believe Cintas is well positioned to benefit from this new normal.\n Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike. \nJ. Hansen: Thanks, Scott. Our fiscal '20 fourth quarter revenue was $1.62 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $1.38, a decrease of 34.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Free cash flow for this year's fourth quarter was the highest it had been all year at $316 million.\n Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, declined 8.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 9.6%. Organic revenue for First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 21.9%.\n Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $708 million decreased 14.1%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 of $207 million decreased 34%. Operating margin was 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 17.5% in fiscal '19.\n Our fiscal fourth quarter contained one less workday than the prior year fourth quarter. One less workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis.\n Fourth quarter of fiscal '20 operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19, including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the operating margin was 15.5%. All of these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow-moving inventory, mostly in our Uniform Direct Sales business, where customers in some of the most severely-impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist.\n Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.4% compared to 21.7% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 was $145 million, and reported earnings per diluted share were $1.35.\n At the onset of the pandemic, we drew on our credit facility in the amount of $200 million. This was for defensive purposes. We have a great cash flow business. And as the quarter progressed, cash generation exceeded our expectations. Cash generated was used not only to repay the $200 million borrowed against the revolver but also to pay off a $200 million term loan. We ended the quarter carrying no variable debt. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion and no material debt maturities in the next 12 months.\n Free cash flow for the year exceeded $1 billion and increased 34.1% over the prior fiscal year. We remain steadfast in our commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. We purchased $393 million of Cintas stock in fiscal '20 under our buyback authorizations, including $200 million in early March before the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion.\n Looking ahead to fiscal '21, please note that there will be one more workday than in fiscal '20. One more workday will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. By quarter, in comparison to fiscal '20, the fiscal '21 first quarter will contain one more workday. The second quarter will contain the same number of workdays. The third quarter will contain one less work day, and the fourth quarter will contain one more workday. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '21 results.\n Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the recent increases in the number of people contracting COVID-19 and the actions governments are taking again in response, uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, since we are more than halfway through our quarter, we are willing to provide our first quarter financial expectations, and they are as follows: revenue in the range of $1.675 billion to $1.7 billion; Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment organic revenue decline of 8% to 9%; First Aid and Safety Services segment organic revenue increase approaching 10%; earnings per diluted share of $2 to $2.20; and that implies a total operating margin in the range of 16.5% to 18% at the revenue midpoint.\n As Scott was quoted in today's earnings release, despite the uncertainty, we are confident in our ability to manage the short-term and maintain focus on our long-term objectives. Todd will now make some comments about the performance of each of our businesses. Todd? \nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. The recent operating environment has certainly been challenging. As Scott mentioned, our focus has been on the safety of our partners and fulfilling the needs of our customers. At the onset of the pandemic, our leadership team attacked the crisis like a major acquisition or investment. Leaders from all areas of the company met daily to gather information, strategize and execute. Daunting challenges were overcome, and many were viewed as opportunities, facilitated by our strong corporate culture, which is rooted in positivity, competitive urgency and concern for employees, customers and other key stakeholders. The results have included a safe and healthy workforce and a rise in Net Promoter Scores from our customers.\n Our approach was to be highly flexible and take a long-term view of our relationship with our customers. Fortunately, we were deemed an essential service in all markets we operate in. However, many of our customers were closed. And even for those who were open, the impact on the financials of their business was substantial. For those customers who are open or ready to reopen, we were able to provide products and services that were critical to providing confidence to their employees and customers that they were in a safe environment. Products like soap, hand sanitizer, masks and disinfectant spray services.\n I'll now turn to the fourth quarter financial performance of our businesses. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies, hand sanitizers and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.27 billion, a decrease of 11%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, organic revenue declined 9.6%.\n Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, compared to 46.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We had one less workday in our fourth quarter, which had a negative impact of about 40 basis points in the current quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by amortization expense on uniforms, dust mats, towels and other items rented to customers. Amortization expense was 300 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last. This noncash expense is a significant headwind in the short term but will improve in ensuing quarters because purchases of new items were reduced and more existing items will become fully amortized.\n As Mike stated, selling and administrative expenses were negatively affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. Excluding the impact of the applicable aforementioned items, Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating margin was 16.1% compared to 18.5% in the prior year period, a decremental margin of 37%.\n Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $196.3 million. Organic revenue for the segment increased 21.9%. Revenue from servicing the first aid cabinets decreased due to the business closures from staying-in-place orders. However, our business of providing personal protective equipment surged, overcoming the revenue declines of cabinet servicing. Sales, service, supply chain, finance and others work quickly to provide current customers with masks, respirators, sanitizer and other critical items needed. In addition, the division secured new business through our ability to source scarce resources quickly. The result was a 40.8% organic revenue growth rate in May. Businesses are echoing our mantra of, \"There is nothing more important than the health and safety of our employees and customers.\"\n The first aid segment gross margin was 46.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 47.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold was 840 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last and is attributable to the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment. Excluding the impact of the applicable previously mentioned items triggered by the COVID-19 coronavirus, the First Aid and Safety Services operating margin was 18.2% compared to 15.4% in the prior year period, an incremental margin of 32%.\n Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Fire Protection Services include the performance of testing, inspection and maintenance of fire protection equipment, including extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers and emergency lights. Uniform Direct Sales business includes the provision of custom-tailored apparel. All Other revenue was $152 million, a decrease of 24.5%. Organic revenue declined 24.5%.\n The fire business organic revenue declined 12.4% due to the inability to access many businesses because of closures from stay-at-home orders. The Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue declined 39.5%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries have been amongst the hardest hit by the pandemic.\n That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today, and that is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. \nAndrew Steinerman: I was hoping you could give a comment about just small and medium-sized businesses in total. Obviously, it's an important part of your client base. Do you feel like the small businesses that haven't opened yet still aren't in a position to open? And if not, do you feel like when would we know more? \nScott Farmer: Well, Andrew, this is Scott. It's -- I'd say we have ongoing conversations with our customers that are on hold, and I would say that the majority of them intend to reopen. A lot of it depends on how long this lasts and that sort of thing, but we feel pretty good about it so far. And the indications that we get from them are that they do intend to reopen, so -- but it's going to be -- it's so cloudy right now looking out into the future. I don't know that any of them could -- on a state-by-state basis, maybe they could give us some sort of an indication of their timing. But in total, it's very difficult for us to be able to do that for you. \nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. And so far, they felt like the federal support for small businesses during this juncture has been sufficient? \nScott Farmer: There's -- I'm sure there are lots of opinions on that. But yes, I think so. I think that we'll find out if more support is coming based on what we understand is going on in Washington right now, both for businesses as well as for individuals. And I think that supporting the individual would, in effect, also be supporting the businesses because they'd have the money to spend to do so. But we'll find out more here in the coming weeks as that gets resolved in D.C. \nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question or comment, and that is from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. \nSeth Weber: I hope you're doing well. Scott, in your prepared remarks, I heard several times you talked about the health care vertical and the opportunity there. Can you just talk about whether you are actually seeing real-time conversions here from hospitals that are switching to more outsourced scrub rental? And just sort of the conversations that you're having there in that vertical, in particular, and I know you've sort of targeted a more specific sales effort there and just traction on how that's going. \nScott Farmer: Sure. Yes. We have, for the last few years, had health care as a vertical that we've spent a lot of time and effort trying to cultivate. I think that you've all probably seen news reports of health care workers after work, going to grocery stores or some other place and being harassed by other customers because the customers were afraid that their clothing was contaminated. And hospitals realize that, health care workers realize that, traditionally, particularly in the nursing end of health care, the nurses have bought their own scrubs and taking them home and wash them themselves. There has been a conversion to professional laundering of those scrubs so that health care workers don't take them home, don't wear them out of the hospital and so forth. And that would be something that we could handle for them.\n We have seen customers who have used our services relative to scrub rental in portions of the hospital expand that into other areas of the hospital. And I think that, that is the beginning of a movement we will see more and more of as I look to the future. \nTodd Schneider: Seth, this is Todd. Just to expand upon that. As Scott mentioned, you see the videos, the folks in grocery stores where people are upset because of what is on their garments. And what we're seeing is employers are worried about what people come in contact with from the point they leave their home to the point they arrive at the hospital, and employees are worried about what they're taking home as well, whom they might come in contact with on the way home and what goes into their home laundry. So this professional cleaning, hygienically, clean laundry is really important. And we've had a number of customers, many of which are names you would recognize, that are very interested in broadening these programs to help their employees and their businesses. \nScott Farmer: And I would just add one more thing. That is not just the big hospital chains. It's also doctors' offices, dentists, health care workers in general. And so we'll -- it's early stage, but we like the momentum that we're seeing there and think that it has an opportunity as we look out in the future for an area of really good growth. \nSeth Weber: Okay. That's super helpful. And Mike, if I could just get a follow up in. Just the delta for the quarter, it came in a little bit better than I think your kind of mid-quarter or late quarter update. Is there anything that you would call out that drove just the relatively better end of the quarter, onetime -- big onetime sales or anything? Or is it just sort of trends just got a little bit better than you expected towards the end of May? \nJ. Hansen: Yes. As Todd talked a little bit about it in his remarks, that first aid really finished with a strong May of 40% growth. And as much as anything, it was that kind of performance that led us beyond the guidance that we gave in mid-May. \nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. \nKeen Fai Tong: Can you provide an update on your uniform rentals' capacity plans, especially with the evolving pace of business reopenings? And what your capacity plans might have in terms of an impact on decremental margins over the next several quarters? \nScott Farmer: Sure, George. The question is what is our capacity plan? Is that -- just make sure I'm answering it the right way. \nKeen Fai Tong: Yes. Historically or recently, you've indicated that you may -- you intend to maintain the majority of your capacity in anticipation of businesses reopening. And now with the pace of business reopenings, obviously in flux with COVID infections spiking in certain places, what are your latest thoughts on maintaining that capacity? Or will you plan to trim capacity given what we're seeing? \nScott Farmer: Well, let me sort of give this a broader view of how we've managed this up to this point. Todd mentioned in his remarks that early on, we had daily meetings with our leadership team, and that's HR and IT and my direct reports, the presidents of the divisions, global supply chain. And we covered a number of different things in that -- in those meetings. It started with the safety of our people and how do we get them the right personal protective gear and how do we make sure that people who are arriving at work aren't infected? And how do we take temperature? Where do we get the thermometer? All that sort of thing. And then from there, moving into the customers.\n But part of it also included a review of business and capacity. And generally speaking, we're happy with where we are from a capacity standpoint, although we continue to review it. There is a -- there is -- we announced that we're shutting down an operation in Minnesota. And that was one that we had been looking at for some time. It was an acquired operation. It was an older facility with older equipment and inefficient layout. And in that market, we have capacity to move the volume into other facilities that are more efficient, more modern. And so we announced that we're going to do that. We consistently review the operations and our capacity on a market-to-market basis, and we'll continue to do that looking forward. Todd, you got anything you want to add? \nTodd Schneider: Yes, George. Great question. We're looking at this in the long term. We're excited about the -- where our position -- our business is positioned. We think that the demands for our products and services moving forward are going to be healthy. When we look at it, we think of image, safety, cleanliness, or all things that businesses are very, very interested in. So we're -- we constantly are evaluating our capacity model.\n As you know, capacity is really a local subject. It rolls up to a corporate subject. But we look at it locally, and we're constantly evaluating it, but we're thinking long term. And we like our position and we like where the demand, we believe, is going to be coming for our products and services. \nKeen Fai Tong: Got it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, can you provide some additional detail on how revenue trends evolved moving through the quarter? And if your fiscal 1Q outlook assumes stable July run rates in August or if it assumes an improvement off of July levels. \nScott Farmer: So George, we've seen -- obviously, since the May call, we've seen some nice improvement in the revenue run rates in which we were in the May time frame down in the mid- to high teens. We've seen that reduce to the mid- to high single digits. And we're expecting still a slight improvement but [Audio Gap] and a lot of improvement as we move forward. So we're seeing a little bit of improvement, but not much from this point. \nOperator: We'll move on to our next question, and that is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. \nHamzah Mazari: My question is on how do you -- the sustainability of first aid organic growth and also, hygiene. If you could touch on what you saw there in terms of growth? And whether you think that's sustainable for the balance of the year? Obviously, demand is still there, but do you think the market's well supplied, whereby that organic run rate drops off? Just any thoughts as to how you're thinking about those 2 specific areas. \nTodd Schneider: Great. Thank you for the question. This is Todd. As Mike and Scott mentioned, trying to forecast out past Q1 is very challenging. And the reason being is the spike in cases recently have changed it. So it seems like every couple 2, 3 weeks is more like 2 or 3 months in the past. So -- but we do see, as cases rise, there's demand for PPE is still strong. As people -- as we believe that drops off with hopefully remedies, vaccine, eventually, people will be back to work, and they'll be consuming more product out of our first aid cabinets. So it's tough to forecast out past Q1. But nevertheless, we think we're in a really good spot. \nScott Farmer: Hamzah, this is Scott. I would add that I think as a general statement, one of the reasons we saw the big spike of these sales in May is because there was really a rush by just about every business out there to find personal protective gear, hand sanitizer, the things that they need to keep their workplace open and clean. And if they could find somebody who had it, they were buying months' worth of supply because they were afraid that if they came back out into the market again to buy it, it may not be there. So it was almost, to me, like what we would see when we would sell a large direct sale customer. We get a big first upfront order as everybody gets their close, and then it drops off to a more typical run rate after that.\n I think that we're going to continue to see the demand for the masks and the hand sanitizers and that sort of thing, but there was a big upfront purchase, a race to make sure that you had enough of it. And it will settle back into an ongoing demand, certainly not at that 40% run rate.\n Now relative to the hygiene services, my read on that is that, that's a long-term change in the marketplace. I said in the May call that I think that what this pandemic has done to workplace cleanliness and sanitation is similar to what 9/11 did to public building security. We have customers right now that have come to us and said, \"Look, I have 7,000 branches. I need hand sanitizer stations at all of them. I need somebody to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they're full. That's for my employees and my customers.\" We've seen large universities, big 10, Pac-10 universities come to us and have thousands of these hand sanitizer stations put up in their buildings across their campuses.\n They want us to do this because not only do we have the sanitizer and the station available but the service to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they have the supply that they need as opposed to worrying about buying a whole bunch of sort of retail pump bottles, trying to put them in places and having those disappear because people grab them and walk away with them.\n So I think that our service and our service model in these areas is playing a big role in the marketplace today with our existing customers and our ability to sign new customers. And once they start talking to us about things like hand sanitizers and surface sanitizers, spray services and things like that, we start talking about their restroom services. And if they have people that need uniforms, we start talking about uniforms and entrance mats and the rest of the things that go along with that. So from a hygiene standpoint, I'm confident that this trend is going to continue. \nTodd Schneider: One last item on that subject is we -- what Scott mentioned. There's such a need for these products because they need to restore for these folks, whether it's a bank branch or a hotel, whatever, university, they need to restore confidence in their employees, their customers, their students, their guests, whatever it is, and these products are critical to restore their confidence.\n Or -- and then what it's also doing for us is it is allowing -- because it's such an important subject to these folks, it's allowing for us to get an audience at very high levels within organizations. Higher than, in many cases, has ever been before in organizations, and then we're able to speak to the comprehensiveness of what we can provide. And it resonates [Audio Gap] \nHamzah Mazari: That's very helpful color. Just a follow-up question. I'll turn it over. Just on the SAP system. Could you maybe talk about what kind of data that gives you now relative to what you didn't have before? I realize it's COVID-19 and demand environment is different, so you may see benefits of cross-selling come in later from the SAP. But just for investors, just to get a sense of what do you have today that gives you sort of a full view of the customer that you didn't have before that can maybe help you longer term once you come out of COVID or during COVID even? \nTodd Schneider: Hamzah, thanks again for the questions. This is Todd. SAP is doing a lot of things for us. We are -- we now have one view of our customer. Not completely, right, because we have it in our first aid business and our rental business, but a significant portion of our business. It's helping the speed at which we're able to retrieve data, which is helping us to make decisions in more real-time basis than in the past.\n And it's also helping with some other items that we're doing from a technology standpoint, give the customer a view of their spend with us, helps them be able to manage their business with us. And obviously, there's some other benefits that we're seeing from an ability to reuse products, get a good view of our stock rooms, of our supply chain, et cetera. So it's been very beneficial. \nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. \nManav Patnaik: My first question is just around the supply chain that you guys have. You talked earlier in the call about your scale aligned to get additional relationship with vendors and so forth. Just broadly, like has there been any other disruptions? Or would you say net-net, it's been pretty smooth? \nScott Farmer: Manav, this is Scott. I would say that -- and this -- first of all, I think this goes back to the morning meetings that we were having. We were getting real-time feedback on what was going on in the field, what our customers were looking for, what they needed and that sort of thing. And we got to jump on it early by having the entire group together to say, we need to get out and source face masks, hand sanitizers, all of the hygiene products because there's a huge demand coming. And our supply chain folks did a fantastic job going out and reacting to that.\n And I said on the last call that I think our supply chain has become a competitive advantage for us. We are in good and getting better stock position on most of these items, and we have competitors that are still struggling to source it at all. And so I think that our supply chain has done a great job. So I would say disruption, no, I don't think there's been any disruption. There were some a little bit at the beginning when we first started trying to find some of these things, but they've done a great job in meeting the demand. \nManav Patnaik: Got it. And just a broader question around managing the cost base. I know there's obviously a lot of uncertainty. You talked about the administrative facility that you were looking at a while back. I think there's another one in the Milwaukee area you closed. But just wondering how you're thinking about what further cost actions you need to take now? Or is it just a wait and see all these things get worse, do you cut more or rationalize more? \nTodd Schneider: Manav, this is Todd. So from a cost standpoint, we know -- we believe we've been through the worst of it. We believe we've shown a great ability to manage through that process. And we're continuing to adjust our cost structure in all facets as we move through this pandemic. We believe it's short term. We believe the long term of our business is -- looks very, very positive. But we've successfully managed through what we believe is the worst of it, and we're going to manage through this process as we move forward, no matter what is thrown at us. \nOperator: And we will move on to our next question, and that is from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird. \nAndrew J. Wittmann: I guess I wanted to check in a little bit on the competitive environment. Every recession is different. But historically, if volumes wane, sometimes there can be increased price competition. So I was just wondering, Scott or Todd, if you could comment on what you're seeing from the competition, if it's too soon to say or if there have been any changes in the marketplace? What those changes are, if any, and how you're reacting to them? \nScott Farmer: Andrew, this is Scott. I'll make some comments, and then if Todd has anything he wants to add, I'll turn it over to him. But overall, I think that it's difficult to say so far what's happening from a pricing standpoint as a result of COVID-19. We'll get anecdotal evidence on a market-by-market basis that things are competitive, if somebody is doing some crazy things. But we always seem to get that. I would tell you that one of the things that we have seen and seen evidence of is that we do have some competitors out there who are struggling to service their customers.\n I don't know whether that is supply chain issues that they can't get the product, whether it is that they have service issues or something's happened in their service force or what it is. But we have seen some signs of that. I wouldn't call that a major trend. But I think it is one of the things that is unique about this pandemic is that for one reason or another, some of these businesses are just having a hard time operating as they ordinarily would. Any other feedback? \nTodd Schneider: Yes. I think the other item is, Scott mentioned that our supply chain organization has done an incredible job in helping position us to service our customers properly, and I completely agree with that. But one of the decisions we made very early on in one of the meetings that Scott has -- we've referenced earlier is that even if we're in a position where we are so unique because we have product that others don't, we're going to take a very long-term approach on how we handle that with the customers. We are going to be extremely fair on pricing and approach it as though it's not a onetime sale. It's going to be a long-term customer.\n And so that's how we approached it. Generally speaking, the environment -- the competitive market is, I would say, Andrew, I haven't seen any real change to the landscape besides some one-off items of lack of supply, those types of things where we've garnered an opportunity to -- that we've levered. \nAndrew J. Wittmann: That makes sense. I guess the corollary to that question is, is the stress that's out there in the marketplace, do you think, potentially going to shake loose opportunities for acquisitions in this environment as well? \nScott Farmer: Well, it's tough to say where and when somebody might decide to sell their business. But you can see a scenario around this in just about any industry where it could cause people to make decisions to sell their business. We obviously are in a position where we could afford to make acquisitions, and that would be something that we would be looking forward to do if the opportunities present themselves. \nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nGary Bisbee: So I wanted to ask a question about the costs. The first quarter outlook implies sequentially improved revenue but sequentially lower costs. So can you just give us a sense sort of how much costs you've taken out or how we should think about how that will annualize through the P&L when you'll actually see all of that?\n And the last piece of that, should we think that some of the cost takeout you've done is structural? Or is it more really temporary that we should think most of it comes back at some point in the future when revenue begins to trend back to the historical levels? \nScott Farmer: Well, it's a little bit of all of the above there. We have eliminated all discretionary spending. Business travel is down. As a matter of fact, we're not allowing people to travel right now. So those kind of costs are down. Some training meetings where people ordinarily would be flying and traveling to go to training and staying in hotels isn't happening. Those are happening in Zoom meetings and team meetings and things like that.\n We have made some changes to rightsize the organization from a labor standpoint. Those can and will go up as volume comes back and that sort of thing. We have -- we've eliminated -- we announced that we're going to close one of our operations. That's more of a permanent or at least a longer-term type of thing.\n But we do all of the above, and we'll continue to look at the changing nature of this and we can head in either direction. We can manage the cost as we grow into it. Or if it -- I think in May, there were 44 states that had stay-in-place orders, general business restrictions that shut down businesses in those states. If it goes back to that, well, we know what that world looks like. We've been there. We're off mid- to high teens in revenue, and we know what we need to do to rightsize, to go back to that point. I don't think that direction is going to happen, but we're ready to go in either direction to manage the costs the way they need to be managed in order to continue to help the P&L statement and make a good margin. \nGary Bisbee: And I know you're not giving guidance beyond this quarter, but would a reasonable way to think about that moving forward be that you think you could manage the cost structure relatively in line with change in revenue?\n So in other words, if Q1 margin actually looks quite strong year-over-year given the revenue headwinds, that you could keep that kind of pacing? Or are there some step function costs that could come back in at some point when you do see revenue much stronger? \nJ. Hansen: Yes, Gary, what we saw in the fourth quarter was such a precipitous drop in revenue that's it's hard to react, but we did. And you're seeing some of those benefits of the reaction in the first quarter. Now as we move, Scott talked a little bit about the -- we will adapt to the revenue and the environment as we move forward. But there are going to be some things like discretionary spending and travel that certainly will come back. We still have a hiring freeze on today. And as we get more clarity on the future, we will start to then think quite a bit more about adding to the capacity for growth like we normally would in a kind of normal environment. And we'll get back to that kind of thing.\n But certainly, we're seeing some benefits in the first quarter of the moves and the decisions we made. And we're going to adapt as we move forward into the second quarter and the rest of the year, but it's a little bit unclear still what that environment looks like. And so we'll make -- we'll continue to make decisions rapidly so that we can do our best to adjust to the levels of revenue and the levels of capacity that are necessary. \nGary Bisbee: If I could sneak one more in. Historically, in Q4, you've given the rentals mix by products. Is that something you have at your fingertips and be willing to share this year? \nJ. Hansen: Sure. We -- our uniform rental business was 50% of the rental segment; dust was 18%; hygiene was 14%; shop towels, 4%; linen products, 10%; catalog, 4%. Not a lot of change from the last year in any of those categories. \nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. \nTimothy Mulrooney: Scott, you mentioned at the beginning of this call about their -- about being there for your customers when they reopen. What percentage of your customer base would you say has reopened at this point? And also, can you help us understand what those conversations look like? When the customer reopens, is it a slower ramp? Is there any sort of contract renegotiation? Or do you just kind of -- do you just pick up where you left off? \nScott Farmer: Well, first of all, we're dealing with a business owner or manager who did not make the decision themselves necessarily to shut their business down. And so the conversation is around what are your plans? When do you hope to reopen? Help us understand what you think will happen in your business and how we can help you. Have you furloughed or let go any of your people? We have large customers who have turned to us to help them develop cleaning protocol for their business. We can share some of that with you. Prior to the pandemic, you were just using these services. We have some other services that might help you to make sure that your workplace is clean and sanitized with various products and services that we can provide. Would you like us to help you get set up with those type of things?\n But really, it's to help them get to a point where they reopen. We look at it and say the lifetime value of these customers is really important to us. And we're not here today to talk about the contract and that sort of thing. We're here today to help you get reopened. As your business starts to come back, we can get into all the rest of the details of that sort of thing. And I would tell you, Tim, that we use the Net Promoter Score system to evaluate our customer satisfaction, if you will, with our services. And we have seen a dramatic increase in Net Promoter Scores as we have moved through this pandemic because of the way that we've helped them, because of the advice and the tools and the services that we can have. I would tell you that we're getting letters from presidents and CEOs of pretty big companies because of what we've done to help them, but it has improved our relationship with -- as a general statement, across the board with our customers as we help them through this. And I'm proud of the way that our frontline people have been handling this, and we look forward to helping more and more of these customers come back online. \nTodd Schneider: Tim, this is Todd. We have such a diverse customer base, both by industry and geographically. So that conversation with the customer really depends upon what's going on in their business, where they are geographically. Some of them, they're opening back up and they had no revenue before they opened back up. Some had virtually all their revenue. And that conversation, as you can imagine, varies dramatically depending upon what they were experiencing in their business.\n But generally speaking, most are being -- were impacted, even those who remained open. And we work with them. We work with the customers, and we said, they said, \"Hey, we can only afford so much.\" We said, \"Well, let's take the -- let's adjust your spend with us down in this area, but we can help you with these areas that are so critical to restoring confidence in your employees and your customers that they're operating in a safe environment.\" And that helped them and helped us to -- is helping us to bring more value to our customers. \nTimothy Mulrooney: That's all great color. A strong increase in Net Promoter Scores is an encouraging sign. And good luck next quarter. \nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question, and that is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. \nToni Kaplan: In the past, you've talked about how about 60% of your growth comes from converting no programmers. And I'm just curious, in this environment, are you seeing a change in that mix? Are you seeing higher growth from existing customers? Or are you seeing maybe new customer signing up for the hygiene products? Just trying to think about how that growth dynamic has been changing in this COVID period. \nScott Farmer: Toni, this is Scott. It's -- we're a couple of few months into this, so it might be difficult for us to give you any hard data on that. But clearly, for certain products, both existing customers who haven't used it from us in the past and prospects need it. And so we're working very hard on both sides of that to provide that to businesses. I think that there are businesses that may not have typically been users of our services that are looking to us now and saying there's an opportunity. There's a company out there that can provide this stuff to us and provide it on a regular basis, where we don't have to worry about it anymore. We should call them and talk to them.\n So I think there's some opportunity in the no programmer market for us to broaden our opportunity to continue to grow. \nJ. Hansen: And Todd, maybe talk a little bit about sales rep productivity that we're seeing right now. \nTodd Schneider: Yes. Thank you, Mike. Toni, what -- our sales and productivity, I am so impressed by their creativity and by their tenacity. They are -- productivity is doing really, really well and it's in part because of our culture, because of our partners. And because we have products and services that people want and need to, again, help restore confidence in their employees and their customers, clients, et cetera.\n So as you can imagine, our sales partners aren't exactly out physically in front of folks nearly as much as they were, but they're busy. They're busy at all-time levels and doing it via calls, Teams calls, Zoom, phone calls, you name it. And we're very encouraged by that. \nToni Kaplan: That's great. And I was hoping you could give an update on the final amount that you've spent on SAP this year and what you expect to spend next year? And just an update on any benefits that you're seeing so far from the implementation. \nJ. Hansen: The spend this year, Toni, has generally been in that recurring -- the implementation costs and the training and consulting costs. And we've talked over the last few years about $12 million annually of that for the last several years. And that amount will drop off as we've completed that rental rollout.\n From the perspective of the benefits, Todd talked a little bit about the information that's available, and sometimes, that's hard to quantify, especially in the short term. But we're seeing the sales rep productivity be good. We're seeing some good information on the one view of the customer, the online portal information. And so those are going to drive some benefits, but it's going to take a little bit of time to see that, and it's pretty difficult at this point to quantify what that might be. \nToni Kaplan: That's great. And the $12 million goes to $0 next year? \nJ. Hansen: Yes. I mean it does drop off. In the -- Toni, in the midst of this changing environment, dealing with the pandemic, it's going to be a little bit hard to say that's going to be x basis points for the year, but that $12 million does drop off as that implementation has been completed. \nOperator: We'll take our next question and that is from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicholas. \nShlomo Rosenbaum: Mike, is there any way you could help investors quantify the opportunity for the scrubs rentals in Cintas? Like what's opportunity just in general into health care with that? And how much of your sales are any way into health care? And is there like a way to think about the pull through? Other words, we're hearing a lot of it. This is a great opportunity. And conceptually, we can understand that. We're trying to figure out like when you put pen to paper, what could this mean for you guys? \nJ. Hansen: Well, Shlomo, Scott talked about the health care opportunity a little bit earlier, and we love the opportunity. We even -- we loved it before the pandemic. But as we sit here today, we like it even more. It's about 7% of our total revenue, and we think that's got a real opportunity to grow. It's hard to put pen to paper and give you a specific number, especially when we are in the midst of this pandemic environment.\n But we love the opportunity. And when we get things like scrub rental products into hospitals, we are there almost every day, and that invites more and more opportunities, whether it's in microfiber or first aid or other types of Cintas opportunities. We love being there with our customer and talking to them about the challenges that they face. And so it generally can lead to more enterprise-type sales at those big hospitals. \n And as we move forward, Scott talked a little bit about we're seeing this cleanliness idea move to the smaller health care facilities as well, and that creates opportunity in the scrubs, in the microfiber and other places. So we really do like the opportunity as we move forward, but it's pretty difficult to put a specific number on it right now. \nShlomo Rosenbaum: All right. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one for Scott. I know you talked enthusiastically about the opportunity you had with your supply chain and that it's a real differentiator and your ability to access very high levels of the organizations now.\n You've had a very long, successful career in this industry. How would you rank this opportunity now versus what you've seen in different points in time of your career in terms of being able to have access and then potentially be able to capitalize on that in terms of driving your business forward in terms of additional sales because of that access at a higher level of the organization? \nScott Farmer: Well, Shlomo, you're right. I've been around for a while, sometimes longer than I can believe. I've been at this -- I started in 1981 right out of college. So it's -- I've seen a lot happen in this business and in this industry. I have always looked at this business with the thought that we have great opportunities ahead of us. And so it's tough for me to say that this is better than others. But there are people that, when I first started going to the trade association meetings, didn't think the entire industry of the rental industry could do the kind of revenue that our company alone is doing now. And so we've been able to grow through all of this.\n I look out into the future and I say I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us relative to our current position, the things that we have to offer businesses across so many different segments that they really, really need right now. I think we're in a very good position. And we -- obviously, all of us need to resolve this pandemic. And I read some great news this morning that one of the reports I saw, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal, said Pfizer thinks that they might have approval sometime in October for a rollout of a vaccine in January. And whether it's January or February or whenever it is, if you think about it, this is July, end of July. And so we're closing in on this race for a vaccine. And hopefully, when that happens, we'll get back to a new normal where all the businesses can open back up. And I think when that happens, we can really maximize our opportunities. \nOperator: We'll take our next question, and that is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. \nScott Schneeberger: I happen to focus on the travel and hospitality end markets, airlines, cruise, hotel, gaming, which look like they may have a bit of a tail of some trouble. Just curious, your conversations, I know you're not providing guidance beyond the current quarter.\n How should we think, based on conversations you've had with those customers, is the good and the bad of consideration looking out over the coming fiscal year? Just anecdotally, what you think are some puts and takes we should keep in mind? \nTodd Schneider: Scott, this is Todd. Certainly, those folks, those customers in the hospitality business, the travel industry, let's say, have been -- they're facing some serious headwinds. But our conversations with them is that they're looking at it long term. They're certainly worried about business travel coming back. Leisure travel, they think, will bounce back faster. But we're working with them at very high levels. And in the case of a few, specifically, we work on teams to help them with their cleaning protocols to help them establish how to provide a safe environment for their guests. And it really all gets back to confidence that the guests have to feel confident that they can travel and be safe. And we are an important portion of that.\n Now certainly, they're not buying certain products such as garments from us at the rates that we would like, and frankly, that they would like. But we do have other products and services that they need to help restore confidence. And that is an important investment that they have to make prior to even their revenues coming back at large -- to a large degree. So they see that much value in it that they're investing in it in the near term and hoping that the guest traffic comes back. And as you know, that is really a subject that depends upon where they are geographically, what type of properties, et cetera. But we're all in hopes that, as Scott mentioned, that we get to remedies and certainly a vaccine very quickly. That way, the ultimate confidence can be restored. \nScott Farmer: That is all primarily direct sales business for us as well so -- at least on the uniform side. So the vast majority of that is reflected in our direct sale results. And they obviously have been hit probably the hardest of all of the segments out there. And maybe that means that it's going to take them longer to recover. But at some point, looking out into the future, I think we all agree that we're going to travel somewhere. We're going to stay some place when we get there.\n And as Todd says, their ability to show us as customers of theirs that we're safe, that we are on a clean airplane and staying in a clean hotel and eating at a clean restaurant, the sooner all that happens and they can gain our confidence, the more likely it is that we're all going to begin to take advantage of what they have to offer. But those industries are going to be around. They're not going to go away. This may change it in some ways, but they will be out there, and they will recover. \nScott Schneeberger: Great. And then just a quick follow-up on -- well, given subject, Scott, you had touched on earlier on the cash availability and consideration of M&A in this environment. Just want a bigger picture of your thoughts on capital allocation for the company because you do have flexibility. Are you going to sit for a while and watch and wait and see what happens and be conservative? Or might we see the -- becoming offensive with M&A, you've addressed, but also other uses of cash, maybe return of capital and thoughts there? \nScott Farmer: Well, yes, I think that our priorities have been, and I think looking forward, will continue to be that we would like to make acquisitions. We'd like to make investments that would help us continue to grow the business. Mergers and acquisitions would be a great way for us to do that. We also have a long track record of increasing our dividend. And those decisions will be made at a future point about what next year's or what our next dividend would be, but that is an important priority for us.\n And obviously, as you have seen in the past, even into the spring, stock buybacks have played a role when opportunities present themselves. I would say that sort of attitude approach is likely to continue as we look out in the future. When and how much and things like that depend on what opportunities present themselves, but our priorities really haven't changed. If we had an opportunity to make an acquisition now, we would certainly want to look at that and take advantage of that opportunity. \nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. So I'll turn the conference back over to Mike Hansen for any closing remarks. \nJ. Hansen: Well, thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking with you again after our first quarter, and that will likely be in mid- to late September. So thank you, and have a great rest of your day. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. All participants may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Schneider",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. The recent operating environment has certainly been challenging. As Scott mentioned, our focus has been on the safety of our partners and fulfilling the needs of our customers. At the onset of the pandemic, our leadership team attacked the crisis like a major acquisition or investment. Leaders from all areas of the company met daily to gather information, strategize and execute. Daunting challenges were overcome, and many were viewed as opportunities, facilitated by our strong corporate culture, which is rooted in positivity, competitive urgency and concern for employees, customers and other key stakeholders. The results have included a safe and healthy workforce and a rise in Net Promoter Scores from our customers.\n Our approach was to be highly flexible and take a long-term view of our relationship with our customers. Fortunately, we were deemed an essential service in all markets we operate in. However, many of our customers were closed. And even for those who were open, the impact on the financials of their business was substantial. For those customers who are open or ready to reopen, we were able to provide products and services that were critical to providing confidence to their employees and customers that they were in a safe environment. Products like soap, hand sanitizer, masks and disinfectant spray services.\n I'll now turn to the fourth quarter financial performance of our businesses. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies, hand sanitizers and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.27 billion, a decrease of 11%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, organic revenue declined 9.6%.\n Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, compared to 46.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We had one less workday in our fourth quarter, which had a negative impact of about 40 basis points in the current quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by amortization expense on uniforms, dust mats, towels and other items rented to customers. Amortization expense was 300 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last. This noncash expense is a significant headwind in the short term but will improve in ensuing quarters because purchases of new items were reduced and more existing items will become fully amortized.\n As Mike stated, selling and administrative expenses were negatively affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. Excluding the impact of the applicable aforementioned items, Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating margin was 16.1% compared to 18.5% in the prior year period, a decremental margin of 37%.\n Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $196.3 million. Organic revenue for the segment increased 21.9%. Revenue from servicing the first aid cabinets decreased due to the business closures from staying-in-place orders. However, our business of providing personal protective equipment surged, overcoming the revenue declines of cabinet servicing. Sales, service, supply chain, finance and others work quickly to provide current customers with masks, respirators, sanitizer and other critical items needed. In addition, the division secured new business through our ability to source scarce resources quickly. The result was a 40.8% organic revenue growth rate in May. Businesses are echoing our mantra of, \"There is nothing more important than the health and safety of our employees and customers.\"\n The first aid segment gross margin was 46.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 47.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's fourth quarter were more than offset by cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold was 840 basis points higher this fourth quarter compared to last and is attributable to the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment. Excluding the impact of the applicable previously mentioned items triggered by the COVID-19 coronavirus, the First Aid and Safety Services operating margin was 18.2% compared to 15.4% in the prior year period, an incremental margin of 32%.\n Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the All Other category. Fire Protection Services include the performance of testing, inspection and maintenance of fire protection equipment, including extinguishers, alarms, sprinklers and emergency lights. Uniform Direct Sales business includes the provision of custom-tailored apparel. All Other revenue was $152 million, a decrease of 24.5%. Organic revenue declined 24.5%.\n The fire business organic revenue declined 12.4% due to the inability to access many businesses because of closures from stay-at-home orders. The Uniform Direct Sales business organic revenue declined 39.5%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries have been amongst the hardest hit by the pandemic.\n That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Seth, this is Todd. Just to expand upon that. As Scott mentioned, you see the videos, the folks in grocery stores where people are upset because of what is on their garments. And what we're seeing is employers are worried about what people come in contact with from the point they leave their home to the point they arrive at the hospital, and employees are worried about what they're taking home as well, whom they might come in contact with on the way home and what goes into their home laundry. So this professional cleaning, hygienically, clean laundry is really important. And we've had a number of customers, many of which are names you would recognize, that are very interested in broadening these programs to help their employees and their businesses. Yes, George. Great question. We're looking at this in the long term. We're excited about the -- where our position -- our business is positioned. We think that the demands for our products and services moving forward are going to be healthy. When we look at it, we think of image, safety, cleanliness, or all things that businesses are very, very interested in. So we're -- we constantly are evaluating our capacity model.\n As you know, capacity is really a local subject. It rolls up to a corporate subject. But we look at it locally, and we're constantly evaluating it, but we're thinking long term. And we like our position and we like where the demand, we believe, is going to be coming for our products and services. Great. Thank you for the question. This is Todd. As Mike and Scott mentioned, trying to forecast out past Q1 is very challenging. And the reason being is the spike in cases recently have changed it. So it seems like every couple 2, 3 weeks is more like 2 or 3 months in the past. So -- but we do see, as cases rise, there's demand for PPE is still strong. As people -- as we believe that drops off with hopefully remedies, vaccine, eventually, people will be back to work, and they'll be consuming more product out of our first aid cabinets. So it's tough to forecast out past Q1. But nevertheless, we think we're in a really good spot. One last item on that subject is we -- what Scott mentioned. There's such a need for these products because they need to restore for these folks, whether it's a bank branch or a hotel, whatever, university, they need to restore confidence in their employees, their customers, their students, their guests, whatever it is, and these products are critical to restore their confidence.\n Or -- and then what it's also doing for us is it is allowing -- because it's such an important subject to these folks, it's allowing for us to get an audience at very high levels within organizations. Higher than, in many cases, has ever been before in organizations, and then we're able to speak to the comprehensiveness of what we can provide. And it resonates [Audio Gap] Hamzah, thanks again for the questions. This is Todd. SAP is doing a lot of things for us. We are -- we now have one view of our customer. Not completely, right, because we have it in our first aid business and our rental business, but a significant portion of our business. It's helping the speed at which we're able to retrieve data, which is helping us to make decisions in more real-time basis than in the past.\n And it's also helping with some other items that we're doing from a technology standpoint, give the customer a view of their spend with us, helps them be able to manage their business with us. And obviously, there's some other benefits that we're seeing from an ability to reuse products, get a good view of our stock rooms, of our supply chain, et cetera. So it's been very beneficial. Manav, this is Todd. So from a cost standpoint, we know -- we believe we've been through the worst of it. We believe we've shown a great ability to manage through that process. And we're continuing to adjust our cost structure in all facets as we move through this pandemic. We believe it's short term. We believe the long term of our business is -- looks very, very positive. But we've successfully managed through what we believe is the worst of it, and we're going to manage through this process as we move forward, no matter what is thrown at us. Yes. I think the other item is, Scott mentioned that our supply chain organization has done an incredible job in helping position us to service our customers properly, and I completely agree with that. But one of the decisions we made very early on in one of the meetings that Scott has -- we've referenced earlier is that even if we're in a position where we are so unique because we have product that others don't, we're going to take a very long-term approach on how we handle that with the customers. We are going to be extremely fair on pricing and approach it as though it's not a onetime sale. It's going to be a long-term customer.\n And so that's how we approached it. Generally speaking, the environment -- the competitive market is, I would say, Andrew, I haven't seen any real change to the landscape besides some one-off items of lack of supply, those types of things where we've garnered an opportunity to -- that we've levered. Tim, this is Todd. We have such a diverse customer base, both by industry and geographically. So that conversation with the customer really depends upon what's going on in their business, where they are geographically. Some of them, they're opening back up and they had no revenue before they opened back up. Some had virtually all their revenue. And that conversation, as you can imagine, varies dramatically depending upon what they were experiencing in their business.\n But generally speaking, most are being -- were impacted, even those who remained open. And we work with them. We work with the customers, and we said, they said, \"Hey, we can only afford so much.\" We said, \"Well, let's take the -- let's adjust your spend with us down in this area, but we can help you with these areas that are so critical to restoring confidence in your employees and your customers that they're operating in a safe environment.\" And that helped them and helped us to -- is helping us to bring more value to our customers. Yes. Thank you, Mike. Toni, what -- our sales and productivity, I am so impressed by their creativity and by their tenacity. They are -- productivity is doing really, really well and it's in part because of our culture, because of our partners. And because we have products and services that people want and need to, again, help restore confidence in their employees and their customers, clients, et cetera.\n So as you can imagine, our sales partners aren't exactly out physically in front of folks nearly as much as they were, but they're busy. They're busy at all-time levels and doing it via calls, Teams calls, Zoom, phone calls, you name it. And we're very encouraged by that. Scott, this is Todd. Certainly, those folks, those customers in the hospitality business, the travel industry, let's say, have been -- they're facing some serious headwinds. But our conversations with them is that they're looking at it long term. They're certainly worried about business travel coming back. Leisure travel, they think, will bounce back faster. But we're working with them at very high levels. And in the case of a few, specifically, we work on teams to help them with their cleaning protocols to help them establish how to provide a safe environment for their guests. And it really all gets back to confidence that the guests have to feel confident that they can travel and be safe. And we are an important portion of that.\n Now certainly, they're not buying certain products such as garments from us at the rates that we would like, and frankly, that they would like. But we do have other products and services that they need to help restore confidence. And that is an important investment that they have to make prior to even their revenues coming back at large -- to a large degree. So they see that much value in it that they're investing in it in the near term and hoping that the guest traffic comes back. And as you know, that is really a subject that depends upon where they are geographically, what type of properties, et cetera. But we're all in hopes that, as Scott mentioned, that we get to remedies and certainly a vaccine very quickly. That way, the ultimate confidence can be restored."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As you know, this continues to be a challenging time for all of us, and we can't thank enough our employees, who we call partners, for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday.\n On May 13, we provided an update on how Cintas' business has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how we were managing the business. COVID-19 continues to be a significant disruption to our economy and to business. Our priorities are unchanged. They include keeping our employees healthy and safe and remaining committed to serving our customers in any way possible. I believe we're succeeding at both.\n Our employee partners have been consistent and diligent in their care of our customers, providing essential products and services to health care facilities, pharmaceutical companies, grocery store chains, food processing plants and many others. We've provided health care customers with clean scrubs and microfiber towels and mats. We've provided tens of thousands of customers with disinfectant and sanitizer spray services. And we've provided tremendous amounts of personal protective equipment, including face masks, face shields and other items to our customers to keep their employees safe.\n Our supply chain has worked feverishly to satisfy this demand. The demand for items like hand sanitizers and N95 respirators has increased tenfold in this pandemic. Our existing suppliers around the world have been key to us meeting this demand, and we thank them for their support. In addition, our scale enabled us to establish additional relationships with dozens of vendors to secure these scarce products. We continue to work to aid existing customers with the products and services that they desperately need, and our ability to access these products that others can't has enabled us to win new customers. We continue to communicate with our customers who remain idled who are -- and are considered on hold, and our focus is on being there to help them when they reopen.\n Before turning the call back to Mike, I want to conclude by stating that I'm thankful for the tremendous dedication of our employee partners. I'm proud of their ability to adapt and persevere in the midst of unprecedented adversity. In addition, I'm as excited as ever about our principal objective of exceeding our customers' expectations to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for our shareholders and working partners. Our value proposition of getting businesses Ready for the Workday by providing essential, unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness and compliance arguably has never resonated more than it does today. This pandemic will not soon be forgotten, and its impact on society is likely transformative.\n We believe a new trend of greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of noncore activities is underway. More health care scrubs are being professionally laundered and managed, so fewer are worn in public. Businesses, including universities and retail establishments, are requiring huge quantities of sanitizer and related services. Most businesses are providing larger budgets to align with proper cleaning protocols and supply chains of these key items are moving to the U.S. to reduce dependence on other nations. We believe Cintas is well positioned to benefit from this new normal.\n Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Well, Andrew, this is Scott. It's -- I'd say we have ongoing conversations with our customers that are on hold, and I would say that the majority of them intend to reopen. A lot of it depends on how long this lasts and that sort of thing, but we feel pretty good about it so far. And the indications that we get from them are that they do intend to reopen, so -- but it's going to be -- it's so cloudy right now looking out into the future. I don't know that any of them could -- on a state-by-state basis, maybe they could give us some sort of an indication of their timing. But in total, it's very difficult for us to be able to do that for you. There's -- I'm sure there are lots of opinions on that. But yes, I think so. I think that we'll find out if more support is coming based on what we understand is going on in Washington right now, both for businesses as well as for individuals. And I think that supporting the individual would, in effect, also be supporting the businesses because they'd have the money to spend to do so. But we'll find out more here in the coming weeks as that gets resolved in D.C. Sure. Yes. We have, for the last few years, had health care as a vertical that we've spent a lot of time and effort trying to cultivate. I think that you've all probably seen news reports of health care workers after work, going to grocery stores or some other place and being harassed by other customers because the customers were afraid that their clothing was contaminated. And hospitals realize that, health care workers realize that, traditionally, particularly in the nursing end of health care, the nurses have bought their own scrubs and taking them home and wash them themselves. There has been a conversion to professional laundering of those scrubs so that health care workers don't take them home, don't wear them out of the hospital and so forth. And that would be something that we could handle for them.\n We have seen customers who have used our services relative to scrub rental in portions of the hospital expand that into other areas of the hospital. And I think that, that is the beginning of a movement we will see more and more of as I look to the future. And I would just add one more thing. That is not just the big hospital chains. It's also doctors' offices, dentists, health care workers in general. And so we'll -- it's early stage, but we like the momentum that we're seeing there and think that it has an opportunity as we look out in the future for an area of really good growth. Sure, George. The question is what is our capacity plan? Is that -- just make sure I'm answering it the right way. Well, let me sort of give this a broader view of how we've managed this up to this point. Todd mentioned in his remarks that early on, we had daily meetings with our leadership team, and that's HR and IT and my direct reports, the presidents of the divisions, global supply chain. And we covered a number of different things in that -- in those meetings. It started with the safety of our people and how do we get them the right personal protective gear and how do we make sure that people who are arriving at work aren't infected? And how do we take temperature? Where do we get the thermometer? All that sort of thing. And then from there, moving into the customers.\n But part of it also included a review of business and capacity. And generally speaking, we're happy with where we are from a capacity standpoint, although we continue to review it. There is a -- there is -- we announced that we're shutting down an operation in Minnesota. And that was one that we had been looking at for some time. It was an acquired operation. It was an older facility with older equipment and inefficient layout. And in that market, we have capacity to move the volume into other facilities that are more efficient, more modern. And so we announced that we're going to do that. We consistently review the operations and our capacity on a market-to-market basis, and we'll continue to do that looking forward. Todd, you got anything you want to add? So George, we've seen -- obviously, since the May call, we've seen some nice improvement in the revenue run rates in which we were in the May time frame down in the mid- to high teens. We've seen that reduce to the mid- to high single digits. And we're expecting still a slight improvement but [Audio Gap] and a lot of improvement as we move forward. So we're seeing a little bit of improvement, but not much from this point. Hamzah, this is Scott. I would add that I think as a general statement, one of the reasons we saw the big spike of these sales in May is because there was really a rush by just about every business out there to find personal protective gear, hand sanitizer, the things that they need to keep their workplace open and clean. And if they could find somebody who had it, they were buying months' worth of supply because they were afraid that if they came back out into the market again to buy it, it may not be there. So it was almost, to me, like what we would see when we would sell a large direct sale customer. We get a big first upfront order as everybody gets their close, and then it drops off to a more typical run rate after that.\n I think that we're going to continue to see the demand for the masks and the hand sanitizers and that sort of thing, but there was a big upfront purchase, a race to make sure that you had enough of it. And it will settle back into an ongoing demand, certainly not at that 40% run rate.\n Now relative to the hygiene services, my read on that is that, that's a long-term change in the marketplace. I said in the May call that I think that what this pandemic has done to workplace cleanliness and sanitation is similar to what 9/11 did to public building security. We have customers right now that have come to us and said, \"Look, I have 7,000 branches. I need hand sanitizer stations at all of them. I need somebody to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they're full. That's for my employees and my customers.\" We've seen large universities, big 10, Pac-10 universities come to us and have thousands of these hand sanitizer stations put up in their buildings across their campuses.\n They want us to do this because not only do we have the sanitizer and the station available but the service to come by on a regular basis and make sure that they have the supply that they need as opposed to worrying about buying a whole bunch of sort of retail pump bottles, trying to put them in places and having those disappear because people grab them and walk away with them.\n So I think that our service and our service model in these areas is playing a big role in the marketplace today with our existing customers and our ability to sign new customers. And once they start talking to us about things like hand sanitizers and surface sanitizers, spray services and things like that, we start talking about their restroom services. And if they have people that need uniforms, we start talking about uniforms and entrance mats and the rest of the things that go along with that. So from a hygiene standpoint, I'm confident that this trend is going to continue. Manav, this is Scott. I would say that -- and this -- first of all, I think this goes back to the morning meetings that we were having. We were getting real-time feedback on what was going on in the field, what our customers were looking for, what they needed and that sort of thing. And we got to jump on it early by having the entire group together to say, we need to get out and source face masks, hand sanitizers, all of the hygiene products because there's a huge demand coming. And our supply chain folks did a fantastic job going out and reacting to that.\n And I said on the last call that I think our supply chain has become a competitive advantage for us. We are in good and getting better stock position on most of these items, and we have competitors that are still struggling to source it at all. And so I think that our supply chain has done a great job. So I would say disruption, no, I don't think there's been any disruption. There were some a little bit at the beginning when we first started trying to find some of these things, but they've done a great job in meeting the demand. Andrew, this is Scott. I'll make some comments, and then if Todd has anything he wants to add, I'll turn it over to him. But overall, I think that it's difficult to say so far what's happening from a pricing standpoint as a result of COVID-19. We'll get anecdotal evidence on a market-by-market basis that things are competitive, if somebody is doing some crazy things. But we always seem to get that. I would tell you that one of the things that we have seen and seen evidence of is that we do have some competitors out there who are struggling to service their customers.\n I don't know whether that is supply chain issues that they can't get the product, whether it is that they have service issues or something's happened in their service force or what it is. But we have seen some signs of that. I wouldn't call that a major trend. But I think it is one of the things that is unique about this pandemic is that for one reason or another, some of these businesses are just having a hard time operating as they ordinarily would. Any other feedback? Well, it's tough to say where and when somebody might decide to sell their business. But you can see a scenario around this in just about any industry where it could cause people to make decisions to sell their business. We obviously are in a position where we could afford to make acquisitions, and that would be something that we would be looking forward to do if the opportunities present themselves. Well, it's a little bit of all of the above there. We have eliminated all discretionary spending. Business travel is down. As a matter of fact, we're not allowing people to travel right now. So those kind of costs are down. Some training meetings where people ordinarily would be flying and traveling to go to training and staying in hotels isn't happening. Those are happening in Zoom meetings and team meetings and things like that.\n We have made some changes to rightsize the organization from a labor standpoint. Those can and will go up as volume comes back and that sort of thing. We have -- we've eliminated -- we announced that we're going to close one of our operations. That's more of a permanent or at least a longer-term type of thing.\n But we do all of the above, and we'll continue to look at the changing nature of this and we can head in either direction. We can manage the cost as we grow into it. Or if it -- I think in May, there were 44 states that had stay-in-place orders, general business restrictions that shut down businesses in those states. If it goes back to that, well, we know what that world looks like. We've been there. We're off mid- to high teens in revenue, and we know what we need to do to rightsize, to go back to that point. I don't think that direction is going to happen, but we're ready to go in either direction to manage the costs the way they need to be managed in order to continue to help the P&L statement and make a good margin. Well, first of all, we're dealing with a business owner or manager who did not make the decision themselves necessarily to shut their business down. And so the conversation is around what are your plans? When do you hope to reopen? Help us understand what you think will happen in your business and how we can help you. Have you furloughed or let go any of your people? We have large customers who have turned to us to help them develop cleaning protocol for their business. We can share some of that with you. Prior to the pandemic, you were just using these services. We have some other services that might help you to make sure that your workplace is clean and sanitized with various products and services that we can provide. Would you like us to help you get set up with those type of things?\n But really, it's to help them get to a point where they reopen. We look at it and say the lifetime value of these customers is really important to us. And we're not here today to talk about the contract and that sort of thing. We're here today to help you get reopened. As your business starts to come back, we can get into all the rest of the details of that sort of thing. And I would tell you, Tim, that we use the Net Promoter Score system to evaluate our customer satisfaction, if you will, with our services. And we have seen a dramatic increase in Net Promoter Scores as we have moved through this pandemic because of the way that we've helped them, because of the advice and the tools and the services that we can have. I would tell you that we're getting letters from presidents and CEOs of pretty big companies because of what we've done to help them, but it has improved our relationship with -- as a general statement, across the board with our customers as we help them through this. And I'm proud of the way that our frontline people have been handling this, and we look forward to helping more and more of these customers come back online. Toni, this is Scott. It's -- we're a couple of few months into this, so it might be difficult for us to give you any hard data on that. But clearly, for certain products, both existing customers who haven't used it from us in the past and prospects need it. And so we're working very hard on both sides of that to provide that to businesses. I think that there are businesses that may not have typically been users of our services that are looking to us now and saying there's an opportunity. There's a company out there that can provide this stuff to us and provide it on a regular basis, where we don't have to worry about it anymore. We should call them and talk to them.\n So I think there's some opportunity in the no programmer market for us to broaden our opportunity to continue to grow. Well, Shlomo, you're right. I've been around for a while, sometimes longer than I can believe. I've been at this -- I started in 1981 right out of college. So it's -- I've seen a lot happen in this business and in this industry. I have always looked at this business with the thought that we have great opportunities ahead of us. And so it's tough for me to say that this is better than others. But there are people that, when I first started going to the trade association meetings, didn't think the entire industry of the rental industry could do the kind of revenue that our company alone is doing now. And so we've been able to grow through all of this.\n I look out into the future and I say I'm very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us relative to our current position, the things that we have to offer businesses across so many different segments that they really, really need right now. I think we're in a very good position. And we -- obviously, all of us need to resolve this pandemic. And I read some great news this morning that one of the reports I saw, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal, said Pfizer thinks that they might have approval sometime in October for a rollout of a vaccine in January. And whether it's January or February or whenever it is, if you think about it, this is July, end of July. And so we're closing in on this race for a vaccine. And hopefully, when that happens, we'll get back to a new normal where all the businesses can open back up. And I think when that happens, we can really maximize our opportunities. That is all primarily direct sales business for us as well so -- at least on the uniform side. So the vast majority of that is reflected in our direct sale results. And they obviously have been hit probably the hardest of all of the segments out there. And maybe that means that it's going to take them longer to recover. But at some point, looking out into the future, I think we all agree that we're going to travel somewhere. We're going to stay some place when we get there.\n And as Todd says, their ability to show us as customers of theirs that we're safe, that we are on a clean airplane and staying in a clean hotel and eating at a clean restaurant, the sooner all that happens and they can gain our confidence, the more likely it is that we're all going to begin to take advantage of what they have to offer. But those industries are going to be around. They're not going to go away. This may change it in some ways, but they will be out there, and they will recover. Well, yes, I think that our priorities have been, and I think looking forward, will continue to be that we would like to make acquisitions. We'd like to make investments that would help us continue to grow the business. Mergers and acquisitions would be a great way for us to do that. We also have a long track record of increasing our dividend. And those decisions will be made at a future point about what next year's or what our next dividend would be, but that is an important priority for us.\n And obviously, as you have seen in the past, even into the spring, stock buybacks have played a role when opportunities present themselves. I would say that sort of attitude approach is likely to continue as we look out in the future. When and how much and things like that depend on what opportunities present themselves, but our priorities really haven't changed. If we had an opportunity to make an acquisition now, we would certainly want to look at that and take advantage of that opportunity."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please begin.\nMike Hansen: Thank you and good evening and thanks for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2020. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Before discussing the financials I want to say that our thoughts go out to all of those impacted by the COVID-19 Coronavirus. This is a challenging time for all of us and we can't enough our partners -- our employees who we call partners for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe, and ready for the workday. We currently find ourselves at the peak of uncertainty as it relates to the pandemic's impact on the economy. The response of our country and each state involves daily. A week ago, we hadn\u2019t seen much impact to our business, and we were expecting today to increase revenue and EPS guidance based on our year-to-date results and fourth-quarter outlook. However, much has changed in a matter of days and more changes are likely to come. Due to this uncertainty, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, we're not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at this time. We certainly remain focused though on the safety and well-being of our employee partners and the care of our customers. So let\u2019s move to providing our third quarter results and then we will open it up for questions. Our fiscal 2020 third quarter revenue was $1.81 billion, an increase of 7.6% over last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $2.16, an increase of 17.4% over last year's third quarter adjusted for G&K integration expenses. Free cash flow for this year's third quarter was $300 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays was 5.7% for the third quarter of fiscal '20. The organic growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was 4.8%, and the organic growth rate for the first aid and safety services operating segment was 12.5%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $824.4 million increased 9.2%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.5% for the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 44.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $314.7 million increased 13.1%. Operating margin was 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16.5% in fiscal '19. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was $234.5 million and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.16. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 17.4%. In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. Third quarter free cash flow was $300 million, an increase of 17.2% compared to last year. In the third quarter of fiscal '20, we paid an annual dividend totaling $268 million. The dividend of $2.55 per share was an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividend. In addition to the annual dividend, we purchased $393.1 million as Cintas' stock in fiscal '20 to date including $200 million in March. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion. We ended our third quarter with fiscal year to date revenue growth of 7.2% and an organic growth rate of 7.1%. Operating income, excluding last year's G&K integration expenses increased 14.7%. EPS adjusted for last year's special items increased 22.2%. And finally free cash flow for the third quarter year-to-date increased 61%. Our employee partners have really done a great job this year. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul for additional details for our third quarter results.\nPaul Adler: Thanks Mike. We have two reportable operating segments; uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety service. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of fire protection services, and our uniform direct sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The uniform rental and facility services' operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 6.6%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 4.8%. Our uniform rental and facility services' segment gross margin was 45.8% for the third quarter compared to 44.9% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 90 basis points. Gross margins have strengthened for many reasons, including strong revenue growth and realization of cost synergies from the acquisition of G&K. Our first aid and safety services' operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $170.5 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 12.5%. The first aid segment gross margin was 48.0% in the third quarter compared to 48.2% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin was due to revenue mix in the quarter, which consists of service, product sales, and training. The strong organic revenue growth benefited from more safety and personal protective equipment product sales, which generally have lower margins than the other revenue categories. Our fire protection services and uniform direct sales businesses are reported in the all other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Uniform direct sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $192.1 million an increase of 9.9%. The organic growth rate was 7.1%. The fire business organic growth rate was 4.1%. Fire revenue was way down by the loss of a struggling national account in the retail sector that recently disclosed the closing of over 100 stores by mild winter weather that resulted in less sprinkler repair service revenue from freezing and bursting water pipes and by a decline in sales rep productivity through the Christmas and New Year's holidays. Uniform direct sale business organic growth rate was 11.1% and benefited from additional sales from a rollout last quarter of Carhartt branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All other gross margin was 41.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.3% last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. G&A labor expense as a percent of revenue improved year-over-year. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was 18.9% compared to 20.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 29 was $234.4 million. Of that amount $144.7 million was in the United States and unrestricted. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $63.2 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows $50.2 million in uniform rental and facility services, $10.1 million in first aid and safety and $2.9 million in all other. Year-to-date free cash flow was $745.2 million, an increase of 61% compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow increased because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. As of February 29 our balance sheet remains strong. Our leverage was 1.7 times debt to EBITDA. We've an untapped credit facility of $1 billion, no debt maturities in the next 12 months and no material debt maturities in the next two years. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And first we have Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.\nManav Patnaik: Good evening, gentlemen. Just, may be in light of all the stuff going on, perhaps you could help us with a little bit more detail in terms of where your exposures lie; whether that's restaurants, lodging, and so forth, just we at least know magnitude of what percentage of revenues are really at risk versus those that could go like 50-50 or whatever it is. I was hoping you could help us with a little bit more color there.\nMike Hansen: Sure Manav. We're -- as I mentioned a bit earlier, we\u2019re really at the peak of uncertainty. We're -- as of a week ago, we didn't really see much impact to our revenue, and so we're going about trying to get a better understanding of that as we go through this weekend and into the future, but let me remind you, we have a very diverse customer base about 30% of our revenues from industrial, 70% from service providing -- the service providing businesses that include healthcare, retail, distribution centers, food service, hospitality, and all of these are being affected in different ways. If you think about healthcare for example, they really need us now. They need our scrubs, they need our microfiber wipes, they need our cleaning chemicals, they need our fire protection. If think about restaurants, some are closed, some are open to only carry out, and we're learning as we visit them this week what are their needs. They may still need some chef works, some hygiene products, first aid, and safety, but it's going to take a little bit of time to understand what those needs are. Office environments, they're looking to stay clean more than ever; and so we're seeing some nice movement there in terms of our first aid and safety, our personal protective equipment like gloves, and then you think about hotels, casinos, arenas they are doing very much business right now, and so we are in the midst of better understanding the collective impact to the business Manav, and gosh we're so early in that process, but it's really hard to break it down because in addition to the details that I just provided and keeping in mind if you think about three digit NAICS [ph] codes, we don't have revenue of greater than 10% in any of those three digit NAICS codes. But also keep in mind, as I talked about revenue per vertical, it's quite different from geography to geography today. So, if you think about some of those different businesses that are on the coasts, they may be impacted more severely than those same kind of businesses in the same verticals in the middle of the country, and so this is -- it's going to take a little bit of time for us to really get clarity on the collective impact to the business, and we're just not there yet.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have a question from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird.\nAndrew Wittmann: Great. Thanks. A question that we've gotten a lot this week is how customer closures work and how they affect you and what the contract says when such things happen. I know there's probably different ways to treat different categories of customers; small customers, large customers, maybe even by end market, but for those customers that are shutting down, we know are shutting down, how does that get treated by Cintas and what is the impact to your financials?\nMike Hansen: That a -- it's a great question Andy, and as I said, we're still working on gaining clarity there, but it's going to be all over the board, right. This is not a normal environment; and in a normal environment, we may have a business shut down for a week and we still may be charging the rental of garments and other products. That means holiday manufacturing shutdowns are a good example of that, semester breaks at school is a good example of that. What we're talking about right now is quite different, and so we have to understand from our customers how long do they think they will be closed and many of them right now don't know. But how long do you think they're going to be closed, and what are the needs of the business today versus maybe where they were a couple weeks ago, and so it's going to be all over the board Andy from small businesses to large businesses and different kinds of verticals in different geographies, and as I said we're working through that to gain clarity.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi Mike. Let me give it a try. So, my sense, I\u2019ve been on this for over a decade looking at Cintas and the group, and my sense is that the uniform rental business really is kind of cyclical on a delay, like when you look at your fiscal 2008, it was actually up. It wasn't until 2009 and 2010 fiscals, you did have kind of moderate declines about 5% organic per year for those two years. So, my question really is, do you think that the impact that you\u2019ve experienced now will be more immediate or do you think it's good to be a delay like I described last recession.\nMike Hansen: Yeah Andrew, this is not, this is not a normal recession or even like the great recession, and so I think there's going to be -- there is going to be a more immediate impact simply because we have -- we have so many businesses that have been ordered to close, right. We've got -- 40 states have closed their schools. I think another over 20 states have closed their restaurants. That's unprecedented, and it's not like our customers are going out of business over time or even had the chance to reduce their workforce. They are kind of closing, many of them on orders of municipalities. And so, there's going to be a little -- there going to be certainly a more immediate impact. What is that impact? Look, one of the reasons that we did not provide guidance is it's really hard to tell. We've never been through a pandemic, and in this pandemic we're seeing things that we really haven't seen in the 90 years of Cintas of running the business, and so we're -- we need a little bit of time for clarity. As I said, we haven't seen much of an impact as of a week ago, but there is going to be an impact coming, and that's why -- that's why we did not provide guidance because it's just too hard to tell right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.\nSeth Weber: I guess just following up on that line of questioning, I think in 2010 your decrement margins were sort of mid-30%. I guess Mike just trying to read what you're saying it seems like the impact could be rather shock. So from a detrimental margin framework, should we think about levels above kind of where you were in the last time that organic growth was down that kind of what you're messaging, thanks.\nMike Hansen: Sure. So if think about the fixed versus variable and how can we -- how will we manage the business right through this disruption and right now there is a fair amount of uncertainty as I've mentioned a number of times and we need a little bit more clarity and the clarity and as it relates to this is really around what's the -- what's the depth of this what's the breath of this, how long will this last, what's the severity and duration? If we start to believe that for example the severity is pretty high but we don't expect the duration to last very long, then we may not be as aggressive because we don't want to harm the long-term opportunities and the performance of the business as we move into the next fiscal year. As we go into this, if we feel like the duration is going to be longer then we may take different steps to pull down some of those variable expenses and so we're going to need a little bit of time to understand what our best expectations are for severity and duration and we'll manage accordingly to that. I can tell you as we sit here today we are generally and we have been for a long time in a mode of growing the business and adding routes and adding laundry capacity and as we sit here today, I would we have not or at least we've slowed CapEx for example to only those things that are essential. And so in other words we're not looking to add routes right now that will reduce CapEx. We're not looking to expand capacity and our wash alleys, add extra -- open new processing facilities, that's going to reduce CapEx. Along those lines that means we likely won't be hiring people to staff those new routes, to staff the adding capacity and so those are -- there are certainly things that we can do today to say we expect to get into a period where the growth isn\u2019t going to be what it was in the first three quarters and so we can pull back on that a little bit and that certainly is going to help the cash flow, but as it relates to then being more aggressive, we are -- we're here for the long term and if we feel like this is a short duration disruption we'll likely treat that a little bit differently than a longer-term duration.\nOperator: Thank you, Sir. Our next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Oil prices have contracted sharply in recent weeks, what are your expectations for your industrial and manufacturing verticals and what factors could potentially cause Cintas to perform differently during this energy downturn compared to the prior 2014 to 2016 downturn?\nMike Hansen: Well I think George if we were looking at this only in the lands of the oil and gas vertical then I'd say a couple things. One, it's a smaller piece of our business than it was at the beginning of that last downturn and so that will not have as big of an impact on us as it did last time and the lower gas prices will certainly help us today. And so if we're just looking at the lens of that particular or maybe a few verticals, I think we fair really well during that and we did several years ago as well, but this is broader, this is certainly broader than just that one lens and so it's going to be really hard to tell exactly how do we think we performed in that one vertical compared to what's going on in the rest of the United States.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.\nGary Bisbee: Hey. Good afternoon. In the earlier question about cost actions you referenced variable versus fixed but actually didn\u2019t give us the mix of the two. Can you take a shot at that and may be just at a high level if you do decide that this could be longer duration what are the kind of actions you would take? Is it just headcount or are there other actions you would take to reduce cost, thank you.\nMike Hansen: Well so Gary if you think about our business there are many variable costs in the business. The question is are they variable to the point where we can turn them off immediately and do we want to turn them off immediately, that's the biggest question there we're dealing with and it's really I think you're responsible as me to give you a percentage of just total variable costs because we have to manage the business and we're managing it for the long-term and so I'm not -- I don't want to throw out some variable number that where you think we will cut to the bone our business. So let me give you some examples though. When you think about the material cost of the business, we've got a lot of cost of disposable products like paper soaps. We have direct sale like our catalog business those are highly variable and if we're not selling them, we don't have those costs. We also have the gas, water and energy, the gas for our trucks, the water energy for running the facilities. There certainly is a variable component of that, but there's also a bit of a fixed and it just depends on how much of that capacity we may decide or not to pull back on. Then if you think about the laundry capacity there are a lot of different pieces that go into that including labor and then when you think about our route capacity we got the cost of our drivers and so there are a lot of variable costs. Our goal is to make sure that our business remains strong for the long term and so if we start to see a longer duration then there are certainly some things that we will do like pullback even a little harder on capital expenditures and other growth pieces of what we do. We may do some things through attrition and we'll have to make sure we understand the capacity utilization and knowing that we want to manage through that. If you go back to '09 and '10, we did close facilities but that was a little bit -- that was a little bit different than that. It was a longer period of a recession. This is potentially deep, but we just don't know the duration and we do not want to impact the business for the long term until we really have to.\nOperator: Thank you, Sir. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Mike, if you could just provide just a little more detail on your contract structure and what I mean by that is if a customer goes bankrupt clearly you see that right away, if it's a closure but how quickly do your contracts adjust to permanent headcount changes. Just any sense as to how defensive your portfolio is but specifically what's the lead lag to headcount changes that may be permanent. I realize absences don't impact your business.\nMike Hansen: Our contracts are generally five-year contracts and they provide for a steady stream of revenue and generally there is some minimum level of revenue that we require but Hamzah we're in a little bit of a different time today and so there's going to be a customer by customer conversation about what makes sense and that's going to take a little bit of time to get through. This is again this is not a normal kind of ramping down a trending down of the business. This is kind of an abrupt closure of a lot of different customers but let's remember something else about our business. As I mentioned a little bit earlier, there are a number of -- there are many businesses that really need our products and services and I don't want that to be lost. There been a couple municipalities in areas within the country particularly on the coasts and we have been identified as an essential provider and so even though other businesses may be shutting down, we are operating because our customers need us and we're going to over the course of the next few weeks, we're going to understand the collective impact but let's keep in mind that while some of our customers are going to be impacted negatively, there are others that really need us, we're seeing an increase in what they need and we're going to do everything we can to take care of them. So it's a mix and we're going -- it's going to take a little bit of time to understand that and give some clarity.\nOperator: Thank you, Sir. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.\nTim Mulrooney: I understand the forearm is very different Mike, but if you go back to the last recession and I can't remember if you broke this out or not, but how did customer retention look through that period. I'm trying to figure out how much of that mid-single digit organic decline in '09 and '10 was due to a deterioration in retention rates versus new customer sales that we're pricing for example?\nMike Hansen: The retention was not negatively impacted that much. It was more about customers reducing their headcount. We certainly did have more customers than normal periods do lot of business and so that contributed to a little bit of a higher loss business number, but generally speaking our retention was really good. And I think our attention outside of possible businesses that actually have to go out of business, I think our retention is going to be very good here. It's going to just -- there's going to be some period of disruption that we have to work ourselves through. I think we have to be careful about comparing this to a prior recession. This is a pandemic that's quite different and the destruction is going to be a little bit more abrupt and immediate. The question is how long will it last and boy if we can get through this as a country in the next 60-90 days, we look forward to getting back to normal operations, but we have to see what that looks like first.\nOperator: Next we have a question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus Investments.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Can you talk about how many of your contacts let's say percentage wise like first safety are those primarily consumption-based contracts or are they contracts that are kind of a recurring revenue, you charges for about per month. Can you go into that a little bit more because first aid and safety has been a very good growth portion of the business, just wondering how those contracts work?\nMike Hansen: Generally those are based on -- there are some recurring revenue streams. I would tell you the bulk of that is consumption-based and the business is performing very, very well right now as you can imagine with the need for sanitizing personal protective equipment. That's a business that is performing very well it has for the whole year and we're getting a lot of customer requests for more ways to help. When you think about the needs of many businesses today, the cleanliness and the safety aspects have really risen and we've got a lot of products and services that can help in those areas and those have been asked for quite a bit over the course of the last couple weeks and I expect that those things will perform well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Can you give us a sense of not only the client mix but what was the revenue trends the last week or so just to get a sense of how much the business came off and then just is there any way to think about it geographically because it sounds like California, New York, Washington maybe that's been a little bit weaker than the interior, but just any thoughts on trends the last week or so and is there any way to kind just bring that out, within a little more context geographically?\nMike Hansen: Unfortunately Kevin through the last week we didn't see much disruption to the revenue. In our direct sale -- uniform direct sale business we did start to see the incoming orders start to come down and so that was -- that was probably the early signs, but through last week not a lot of impact. There have been certainly some impact on the coasts and so for example all of our customers in New Rochelle they're hard to get to as you can imagine with the National Guard patrolling the streets there. That's been difficult. There are others that have been difficult on the West Coast as well, but collectively it wasn't that big of an impact. I expect that we will start to see some impact as we go through the rest of this week and certainly then in next week and that's when we're going to start to be able to get a little clarity on what's the initial response of our customers and what might there need to be as we move as we move through. And like I said there are going to be some customers where there needs have really increased. There are going to be others who have closed and we're going to be talking about a different -- there's a different conversation there. We need to get through all those conversations though.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer & Co.\nScott Schneeberger: I guess you\u2019ve alluded to CapEx a few times, just looking at it year to date, you're trending I think your guidance at the midpoint this year was the same as what you did last year but your trending about $17 million below for my numbers. So I just care it would be delve into CapEx a little bit more and I think you had said you had already taking some action with regard to what you\u2019ve been seeing over the last weeks or months. So just kind of delve in a little bit more on what you would be thinking about on a go forward basis as well thanks.\nMike Hansen: Sure when I mentioned that we've made some decisions to reduce CapEx that's a very, very recent type of conversation. We are going to look, we are when we think about CapEx, we love to grow the business and we are -- we have been expanding the routes as necessary and expanding capacity, but we've also keep in mind we've gotten some capacity through the G&K deal and we've gotten some efficiency through projects within the facilities and our routes -- the revenue per route has been growing and so we've become a little bit more efficient and so we've been pretty efficient and I would say prudent in CapEx throughout the year. But having said that going forward we've been at let's call it a $50 million $65 million quarterly clip and certainly that's going come down probably by half. Now I don't have a very -- I don't have a scientific measurement but it's going to come down quite a bit as we think about the fourth quarter. Beyond the fourth quarter it's going to get back to our expectation for the severity and duration of this.\nOperator: Our last question in the queue comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you to save the best for the last. I am going to take the road less travel then ask a question about the quarter. Can you talk about the organic growth deceleration within the uniform rental space? It sounds like it wasn't related to coronavirus since you hadn't really seen an impact from that yet. So I guess just what were that main drivers of the deceleration within rental? Thank you.\nMike Hansen: We've talked a little bit over the last two quarters about the choppiness that we've seen in industrials and we certainly saw that pick up a little bit in our third quarter. Now whether that has to do with China in the early parts of the quarter, not sure or the uncertainty around this, that's really hard to put our finger on, but we certainly did see some choppiness in that side of the business and contributed to a little bit of a deceleration there. Pricing was a bit more aggressive in the quarter. We talked a little bit about that in our second quarter and that remained here in the third quarter and the holidays I mentioned this in the second quarter call back in December, the holidays are tough what you've got two holidays on a Wednesday, generally speaking our sales people have a really hard time of setting appointments and so you if you think about a two-week period of time where you've got many customers because it's on a Wednesday taking the whole week off or in and out, it's really hard to set appointments. And so we did see some impact to our sales rep productivity. Paul mentioned in fire and also in rental and that was a bit of a contributor as well. So collectively those things we're what we saw in the third quarter. Let's set aside the pandemic, the business has been operating at a very healthy pace and we really like the execution of it and while the disruption is coming, we think we're poised pretty well to manage through that and get back on to our business once we get through this.\nOperator: Thank you, Sir. That concludes the question-and-answer session for today's call and I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Hansen for closing remarks.\nMike Hansen: Thank you and before ending the call, we would like to leave you with a couple final comments. For someone to say again that our thoughts remain with those impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus as our country works to get through this difficult situation as quickly as possible. But secondly, our business has performed very well over the course of the last 10 years with strong revenue, income and EPS growth. In fact we've grown our sales and profit in 48 of the last 50 years and although we're entering a period of disruption, we and all Cintas partners remain excited about the future opportunities of our business and look forward to getting back to business as usual. In the meantime we are well-positioned to enter this period of disruption with a strong cash flow, a very solid balance sheet and an uncapped $1 billion credit facility. So we feel good about our ability to manage through this and come out the other side with a very strong business. So thank you again for joining us tonight. We'll issue our fourth quarter financial results in July and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference and you may now disconnect. Please enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Thank you and good evening and thanks for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2020. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Before discussing the financials I want to say that our thoughts go out to all of those impacted by the COVID-19 Coronavirus. This is a challenging time for all of us and we can't enough our partners -- our employees who we call partners for doing all that they can to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe, and ready for the workday. We currently find ourselves at the peak of uncertainty as it relates to the pandemic's impact on the economy. The response of our country and each state involves daily. A week ago, we hadn't seen much impact to our business, and we were expecting today to increase revenue and EPS guidance based on our year-to-date results and fourth-quarter outlook. However, much has changed in a matter of days and more changes are likely to come. Due to this uncertainty, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, we're not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at this time. We certainly remain focused though on the safety and well-being of our employee partners and the care of our customers. So let's move to providing our third quarter results and then we will open it up for questions. Our fiscal 2020 third quarter revenue was $1.81 billion, an increase of 7.6% over last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations were $2.16, an increase of 17.4% over last year's third quarter adjusted for G&K integration expenses. Free cash flow for this year's third quarter was $300 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays was 5.7% for the third quarter of fiscal '20. The organic growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was 4.8%, and the organic growth rate for the first aid and safety services operating segment was 12.5%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $824.4 million increased 9.2%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.5% for the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 44.9% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '20 of $314.7 million increased 13.1%. Operating margin was 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16.5% in fiscal '19. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was $234.5 million and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.16. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 17.4%. In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. Third quarter free cash flow was $300 million, an increase of 17.2% compared to last year. In the third quarter of fiscal '20, we paid an annual dividend totaling $268 million. The dividend of $2.55 per share was an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividend. In addition to the annual dividend, we purchased $393.1 million as Cintas' stock in fiscal '20 to date including $200 million in March. The amount remaining under our buyback authorization is $1.1 billion. We ended our third quarter with fiscal year to date revenue growth of 7.2% and an organic growth rate of 7.1%. Operating income, excluding last year's G&K integration expenses increased 14.7%. EPS adjusted for last year's special items increased 22.2%. And finally free cash flow for the third quarter year-to-date increased 61%. Our employee partners have really done a great job this year. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul for additional details for our third quarter results. Sure Manav. We're -- as I mentioned a bit earlier, we're really at the peak of uncertainty. We're -- as of a week ago, we didn't really see much impact to our revenue, and so we're going about trying to get a better understanding of that as we go through this weekend and into the future, but let me remind you, we have a very diverse customer base about 30% of our revenues from industrial, 70% from service providing -- the service providing businesses that include healthcare, retail, distribution centers, food service, hospitality, and all of these are being affected in different ways. If you think about healthcare for example, they really need us now. They need our scrubs, they need our microfiber wipes, they need our cleaning chemicals, they need our fire protection. If think about restaurants, some are closed, some are open to only carry out, and we're learning as we visit them this week what are their needs. They may still need some chef works, some hygiene products, first aid, and safety, but it's going to take a little bit of time to understand what those needs are. Office environments, they're looking to stay clean more than ever; and so we're seeing some nice movement there in terms of our first aid and safety, our personal protective equipment like gloves, and then you think about hotels, casinos, arenas they are doing very much business right now, and so we are in the midst of better understanding the collective impact to the business Manav, and gosh we're so early in that process, but it's really hard to break it down because in addition to the details that I just provided and keeping in mind if you think about three digit NAICS [ph] codes, we don't have revenue of greater than 10% in any of those three digit NAICS codes. But also keep in mind, as I talked about revenue per vertical, it's quite different from geography to geography today. So, if you think about some of those different businesses that are on the coasts, they may be impacted more severely than those same kind of businesses in the same verticals in the middle of the country, and so this is -- it's going to take a little bit of time for us to really get clarity on the collective impact to the business, and we're just not there yet. That a -- it's a great question Andy, and as I said, we're still working on gaining clarity there, but it's going to be all over the board, right. This is not a normal environment; and in a normal environment, we may have a business shut down for a week and we still may be charging the rental of garments and other products. That means holiday manufacturing shutdowns are a good example of that, semester breaks at school is a good example of that. What we're talking about right now is quite different, and so we have to understand from our customers how long do they think they will be closed and many of them right now don't know. But how long do you think they're going to be closed, and what are the needs of the business today versus maybe where they were a couple weeks ago, and so it's going to be all over the board Andy from small businesses to large businesses and different kinds of verticals in different geographies, and as I said we're working through that to gain clarity. Yeah Andrew, this is not, this is not a normal recession or even like the great recession, and so I think there's going to be -- there is going to be a more immediate impact simply because we have -- we have so many businesses that have been ordered to close, right. We've got -- 40 states have closed their schools. I think another over 20 states have closed their restaurants. That's unprecedented, and it's not like our customers are going out of business over time or even had the chance to reduce their workforce. They are kind of closing, many of them on orders of municipalities. And so, there's going to be a little -- there going to be certainly a more immediate impact. What is that impact? Look, one of the reasons that we did not provide guidance is it's really hard to tell. We've never been through a pandemic, and in this pandemic we're seeing things that we really haven't seen in the 90 years of Cintas of running the business, and so we're -- we need a little bit of time for clarity. As I said, we haven't seen much of an impact as of a week ago, but there is going to be an impact coming, and that's why -- that's why we did not provide guidance because it's just too hard to tell right now. Sure. So if think about the fixed versus variable and how can we -- how will we manage the business right through this disruption and right now there is a fair amount of uncertainty as I've mentioned a number of times and we need a little bit more clarity and the clarity and as it relates to this is really around what's the -- what's the depth of this what's the breath of this, how long will this last, what's the severity and duration? If we start to believe that for example the severity is pretty high but we don't expect the duration to last very long, then we may not be as aggressive because we don't want to harm the long-term opportunities and the performance of the business as we move into the next fiscal year. As we go into this, if we feel like the duration is going to be longer then we may take different steps to pull down some of those variable expenses and so we're going to need a little bit of time to understand what our best expectations are for severity and duration and we'll manage accordingly to that. I can tell you as we sit here today we are generally and we have been for a long time in a mode of growing the business and adding routes and adding laundry capacity and as we sit here today, I would we have not or at least we've slowed CapEx for example to only those things that are essential. And so in other words we're not looking to add routes right now that will reduce CapEx. We're not looking to expand capacity and our wash alleys, add extra -- open new processing facilities, that's going to reduce CapEx. Along those lines that means we likely won't be hiring people to staff those new routes, to staff the adding capacity and so those are -- there are certainly things that we can do today to say we expect to get into a period where the growth isn't going to be what it was in the first three quarters and so we can pull back on that a little bit and that certainly is going to help the cash flow, but as it relates to then being more aggressive, we are -- we're here for the long term and if we feel like this is a short duration disruption we'll likely treat that a little bit differently than a longer-term duration. Well I think George if we were looking at this only in the lands of the oil and gas vertical then I'd say a couple things. One, it's a smaller piece of our business than it was at the beginning of that last downturn and so that will not have as big of an impact on us as it did last time and the lower gas prices will certainly help us today.

Well so Gary if you think about our business there are many variable costs in the business. The question is are they variable to the point where we can turn them off immediately and do we want to turn them off immediately, that's the biggest question there we're dealing with and it's really I think you're responsible as me to give you a percentage of just total variable costs because we have to manage the business and we're managing it for the long-term and so I'm not -- I don't want to throw out some variable number that where you think we will cut to the bone our business.

There certainly is a variable component of that, but there's also a bit of a fixed and it just depends on how much of that capacity we may decide or not to pull back on. Then if you think about the laundry capacity there are a lot of different pieces that go into that including labor and then when you think about our route capacity we got the cost of our drivers and so there are a lot of variable costs. Our goal is to make sure that our business remains strong for the long term and so if we start to see a longer duration then there are certainly some things that we will do like pullback even a little harder on capital expenditures and other growth pieces of what we do. We may do some things through attrition and we'll have to make sure we understand the capacity utilization and knowing that we want to manage through that. If you go back to '09 and '10, we did close facilities but that was a little bit -- that was a little bit different than that. It was a longer period of a recession. This is potentially deep, but we just don't know the duration and we do not want to impact the business for the long term until we really have to. Our contracts are generally five-year contracts and they provide for a steady stream of revenue and generally there is some minimum level of revenue that we require but Hamzah we're in a little bit of a different time today and so there's going to be a customer by customer conversation about what makes sense and that's going to take a little bit of time to get through. This is again this is not a normal kind of ramping down a trending down of the business. This is kind of an abrupt closure of a lot of different customers but let's remember something else about our business. As I mentioned a little bit earlier, there are a number of -- there are many businesses that really need our products and services and I don't want that to be lost. There been a couple municipalities in areas within the country particularly on the coasts and we have been identified as an essential provider and so even though other businesses may be shutting down, we are operating because our customers need us and we're going to over the course of the next few weeks, we're going to understand the collective impact but let's keep in mind that while some of our customers are going to be impacted negatively, there are others that really need us, we're seeing an increase in what they need and we're going to do everything we can to take care of them. So it's a mix and we're going -- it's going to take a little bit of time to understand that and give some clarity. The retention was not negatively impacted that much. It was more about customers reducing their headcount. We certainly did have more customers than normal periods do lot of business and so that contributed to a little bit of a higher loss business number, but generally speaking our retention was really good. And I think our attention outside of possible businesses that actually have to go out of business, I think our retention is going to be very good here. It's going to just -- there's going to be some period of disruption that we have to work ourselves through. I think we have to be careful about comparing this to a prior recession. This is a pandemic that's quite different and the destruction is going to be a little bit more abrupt and immediate. The question is how long will it last and boy if we can get through this as a country in the next 60-90 days, we look forward to getting back to normal operations, but we have to see what that looks like first. Generally those are based on -- there are some recurring revenue streams. I would tell you the bulk of that is consumption-based and the business is performing very, very well right now as you can imagine with the need for sanitizing personal protective equipment. That's a business that is performing very well it has for the whole year and we're getting a lot of customer requests for more ways to help. When you think about the needs of many businesses today, the cleanliness and the safety aspects have really risen and we've got a lot of products and services that can help in those areas and those have been asked for quite a bit over the course of the last couple weeks and I expect that those things will perform well. Unfortunately Kevin through the last week we didn't see much disruption to the revenue. In our direct sale -- uniform direct sale business we did start to see the incoming orders start to come down and so that was -- that was probably the early signs, but through last week not a lot of impact. There have been certainly some impact on the coasts and so for example all of our customers in New Rochelle they're hard to get to as you can imagine with the National Guard patrolling the streets there. That's been difficult. There are others that have been difficult on the West Coast as well, but collectively it wasn't that big of an impact. I expect that we will start to see some impact as we go through the rest of this week and certainly then in next week and that's when we're going to start to be able to get a little clarity on what's the initial response of our customers and what might there need to be as we move as we move through. And like I said there are going to be some customers where there needs have really increased. There are going to be others who have closed and we're going to be talking about a different -- there's a different conversation there. We need to get through all those conversations though. Sure when I mentioned that we've made some decisions to reduce CapEx that's a very, very recent type of conversation. We are going to look, we are when we think about CapEx, we love to grow the business and we are -- we have been expanding the routes as necessary and expanding capacity, but we've also keep in mind we've gotten some capacity through the G&K deal and we've gotten some efficiency through projects within the facilities and our routes -- the revenue per route has been growing and so we've become a little bit more efficient and so we've been pretty efficient and I would say prudent in CapEx throughout the year. But having said that going forward we've been at let's call it a $50 million $65 million quarterly clip and certainly that's going come down probably by half. Now I don't have a very -- I don't have a scientific measurement but it's going to come down quite a bit as we think about the fourth quarter. Beyond the fourth quarter it's going to get back to our expectation for the severity and duration of this. We've talked a little bit over the last two quarters about the choppiness that we've seen in industrials and we certainly saw that pick up a little bit in our third quarter. Now whether that has to do with China in the early parts of the quarter, not sure or the uncertainty around this, that's really hard to put our finger on, but we certainly did see some choppiness in that side of the business and contributed to a little bit of a deceleration there. Pricing was a bit more aggressive in the quarter. We talked a little bit about that in our second quarter and that remained here in the third quarter and the holidays I mentioned this in the second quarter call back in December, the holidays are tough what you've got two holidays on a Wednesday, generally speaking our sales people have a really hard time of setting appointments and so you if you think about a two-week period of time where you've got many customers because it's on a Wednesday taking the whole week off or in and out, it's really hard to set appointments. And so we did see some impact to our sales rep productivity. Paul mentioned in fire and also in rental and that was a bit of a contributor as well. So collectively those things we're what we saw in the third quarter. Let's set aside the pandemic, the business has been operating at a very healthy pace and we really like the execution of it and while the disruption is coming, we think we're poised pretty well to manage through that and get back on to our business once we get through this. Thank you and before ending the call, we would like to leave you with a couple final comments. For someone to say again that our thoughts remain with those impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus as our country works to get through this difficult situation as quickly as possible. But secondly, our business has performed very well over the course of the last 10 years with strong revenue, income and EPS growth. In fact we've grown our sales and profit in 48 of the last 50 years and although we're entering a period of disruption, we and all Cintas partners remain excited about the future opportunities of our business and look forward to getting back to business as usual. In the meantime we are well-positioned to enter this period of disruption with a strong cash flow, a very solid balance sheet and an uncapped $1 billion credit facility. So we feel good about our ability to manage through this and come out the other side with a very strong business. So thank you again for joining us tonight. We'll issue our fourth quarter financial results in July and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time."

            "content": "Thanks Mike. We have two reportable operating segments; uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety service. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of fire protection services, and our uniform direct sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The uniform rental and facility services' operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 6.6%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 4.8%. Our uniform rental and facility services' segment gross margin was 45.8% for the third quarter compared to 44.9% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 90 basis points. Gross margins have strengthened for many reasons, including strong revenue growth and realization of cost synergies from the acquisition of G&K. Our first aid and safety services' operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $170.5 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 12.5%. The first aid segment gross margin was 48.0% in the third quarter compared to 48.2% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin was due to revenue mix in the quarter, which consists of service, product sales, and training. The strong organic revenue growth benefited from more safety and personal protective equipment product sales, which generally have lower margins than the other revenue categories. Our fire protection services and uniform direct sales businesses are reported in the all other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Uniform direct sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $192.1 million an increase of 9.9%. The organic growth rate was 7.1%. The fire business organic growth rate was 4.1%. Fire revenue was way down by the loss of a struggling national account in the retail sector that recently disclosed the closing of over 100 stores by mild winter weather that resulted in less sprinkler repair service revenue from freezing and bursting water pipes and by a decline in sales rep productivity through the Christmas and New Year's holidays. Uniform direct sale business organic growth rate was 11.1% and benefited from additional sales from a rollout last quarter of Carhartt branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All other gross margin was 41.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.3% last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.3% in the third quarter of fiscal '19. G&A labor expense as a percent of revenue improved year-over-year. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '20 was 18.9% compared to 20.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 29 was $234.4 million. Of that amount $144.7 million was in the United States and unrestricted. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $63.2 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows $50.2 million in uniform rental and facility services, $10.1 million in first aid and safety and $2.9 million in all other. Year-to-date free cash flow was $745.2 million, an increase of 61% compared to the prior year period. Free cash flow increased because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. As of February 29 our balance sheet remains strong. Our leverage was 1.7 times debt to EBITDA. We've an untapped credit facility of $1 billion, no debt maturities in the next 12 months and no material debt maturities in the next two years. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions."

        "content": "Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nMike Hansen: Good evening. And thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was a record $1.84 billion, an increase of 7.3% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was also 7.3%. In the second quarter of fiscal '20, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 5.8%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 10.6%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $852.4 million increased 10%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46.2% for the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 130 basis points from last year's second quarter to 46.6%, and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin improved 40 basis points to 48.4%. Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $334.5 million increased 21.3%. Operating margin was 18.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16% in fiscal '19. Operating income in the second quarter of fiscal '19 was impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $7.8 million or 50 basis points. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was $246.4 million and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.27. Excluding the one-time gain on the sale of a cost method investment and the G&K acquisition integration expenses, both in fiscal '19, EPS increased 29%. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer who's quoted in today's earnings press release, we are pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance. We thank our employee partners for continuing to execute well and take great care of our customers. In addition to the strong financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. On December 6th, we paid an annual dividend of $2.55 per share, an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividends. We've increased the dividend for 36 consecutive years. In the past 10 years, the annual dividend per share increased at a compound annual growth rate of 18.2%. Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide an update of our fiscal '20 expectations. We have increased our expectations of financial performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.29 billion to $7.33 billion. We expect EPS to be in the range of $8.65 to $8.75. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5.8% for 6.4%. However, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate range at guidance is 6.2% to 6.8%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS, reducing it about $0.06, which is 90 basis points drag on the EPS growth rate. Adjusting for this, the EPS growth rate range is 14.7% to 16%. Guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 19.2% compared to a rate of 19.7% for fiscal '19. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. It assumes a share counts for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. The guidance does not assume any future share buybacks or any additional G&K integration expenses. I'll now turn the call over Paul.\nPaul Adler: Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwinds, using fiscal '19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses, like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats, are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. And we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19. Each quarter of fiscal '20 contains 65 workdays. In comparison to fiscal '19, our upcoming Q3 of fiscal '20 will have one additional day, and our Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All-Other. All-Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All-Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on ramp. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion, an increase for 5.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46.6% for the second quarter compared to 45.3% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of 130 basis points. Operating Income margin was a record 19.5% for the second quarter and it was 19% year-to-date. Profit margins have strengthened for many reasons including strong revenue growth and realization of profit synergies from the acquisition of G&K. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. The segment's revenue for the second quarter was $169.7 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 10.6%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 14.4% in the second quarter compared to 14% in masters second quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. First Aid segment gross margins continued to increase with strong revenue growth. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in all other categories. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and service from our other business units. All Other revenue was $204.1 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate was 16.5%. The Fire business organic growth rate was 9.6%. Uniform Direct Sales business saw an exceptionally strong quarter, posting an organic growth rate of 25%. Growth was driven in large part due to the rollout of Carhartt branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All Other gross margin was 41.8% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Improvement was realized in many areas, including lower G&A labor expense as a percentage of revenue. Last quarter, we mentioned that medical expense as a percent of revenue spiked. It came back in line in the second quarter as we expected. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.1%. Stock based compensation positively impacted the tax rate. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30th was $226.5 million. Year-to-date, operating cash flow increased about 66% from last year, because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $61.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows; $48.6 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10.8 million in First Aid and Safety, and $2 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '20 CapEx to be in a range of $265 million to $290 million. As of November 30th, total debt was $2,738.4 million. $2,538.6 million was fixed interest rate debt and $199.8 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan. At November 30th, our leverage was 1.8 times debt-to-EBITDA. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Toni Kaplan at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: You had a pretty solid beat in the quarter, but only a modest 2% raise for the full year. Could you just talk about your expectations around maybe the broader macro and anything else that might be one-time in the quarter, or might reverse as we go through the year? Just wondering why not a bigger raise? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: And Toni, you are speaking of revenue right now. Correct?\nToni Kaplan: Yes.\nMike Hansen: And so, from a -- let's talk about the quarter. We had a very good quarter. The -- all of our businesses grew, and in particular our direct sale business had a really nice quarter. Toni, you'd asked a little bit about the macro first. And I would say not a lot of change during the quarter. We did say at the beginning of the quarter that energy, we were starting to see a little bit of softness in the energy area. We did see a little bit of that during the quarter. In fact, we had one fairly good sized customer in the space go bankrupt. But I would say, the other thing is, industrials are a bit choppy, generally speaking. Having said that, not a lot of change during the quarter. We are encouraged, as we kind of forward, we are encouraged that we've -- it looks like we've made some progress in the USMCA and China trade and we're encouraged by the movement there and we look forward to getting those results. It seems like we seen a little bit of a steady direction out of the Fed on interest rates. And so, as we leave the second quarter, I would say there are some encouraging signs, but there's still we're entering the election year, there still is a lot going on in terms of the noise in the marketplace, and whether or not small business and other businesses will continue to invest. And so we still look a little bit with caution as we think about the second half of the year. As it relates to the guidance, look, we had a very good first half of the year. Our partners did a great job, and the year is playing out generally as we expected. We had growth of roughly 7%. Organic growth of over 7% for the first half of the year, but we also have some things that went our way. I talked a little bit about this in the first quarter where rental probably got a little bit of year-over-year benefit in the first quarter and that certainly helped as we kind of were finding the bottom last year in our rental business as we've lapped the G&K acquisition. So again, a little bit of benefit in the first half there. We talked about pricing being incrementally positive in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, maybe not quite as incrementally positive in the second quarter but certainly, some benefit in the first half of the year. I would expect that that we'll fall back into kind of the pricing range we've been in the last few years. When you think about the Direct Sale business, we talked about that, we referred of that a few times, had a great year in the first half. In the second half, our expectation is, as this business can be lumpy that we'll be flat to down in that. And so just that alone is about 75 basis points of growth impact when you compare the first half to the second half. I talked a little bit about the outlook on the macro. And so as we think about the second half, we're thinking about the macro. We're thinking about -- there are some things that really went well in the first half, may not get all of that benefit in the second half. Having said all of that, look, it's -- our same work day growth is 6.2 to 6.8, and the year is shaping up pretty much the way we expected it to. And if we can hit those kind of numbers, that's a really nice year for us.\nToni Kaplan: And just wanted to ask about buybacks, you really pulled back pretty dramatically this quarter. Just wanted to get some color around, how we should be thinking about any sort of change to capital deployment philosophy, or just why it's very minimal buybacks this quarter?\nMike Hansen: Yes, we do have -- we've got the authorization of about 1.2 billion. And we look at that, as we talked about, we look at that opportunistically. One thing to keep in mind is we, in the first week of December, we made $268 million payment related to our dividend, and we also have some debt interest payments. So we're back into CP in the month of December, but we will look at the buyback opportunistically as we move through the rest of the year. And specifically to your question, we have not made any changes to the way we think about capital allocation.\nOperator: We will now take the next question from Hamzah Mazari at Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nHamzah Mazari: My first question is just on the SAP rollout sort of just any update there. Specifically, where do you see benefits once that's rolled out in April or May next year? Is that going to be an organic growth through cross-selling, or do we see sort of SG&A come off? Any color as to benefits of that rollout?\nMike Hansen: Hamza, we're about 85% of the way through our SAP journey at this point in time, so we've made some good progress in the quarter. And we're still on track to complete the project by the end of the fiscal year. As far as benefits are concerned, I think the benefits from SAP are going to be kind of throughout the P&L. We've talked about some of them already that that can be achieved by locations individually, better technology in the hands of the people providing the services, better information at their disposal, the ability for our accounting and finance people and operations people to look at data from the very back of the house all the way to invoicing and pricing with the customer. But then there are other benefits to that that we believe will be benefiting the top-line later on and more perhaps impactfully when the entire network is in the system. But certainly, we believe that putting the Uniform Rental business and our First Aid business in the same operating system will foster more collaboration, more cross-selling, which will help the top-line. And just better, as I mentioned earlier, use the data, looking at our big, large national accounts, from city-to-city-to city to do analyses and make sure that we're getting all the entitled revenue that we should for the agreements, make sure the pricing is appropriate for the contract. So lots of opportunities, but not able to quantify anything at this point in time. As I said, we'll complete that rollout this fiscal year and have more color next fiscal year for you.\nHamzah Mazari: And just a follow-up question and I'll turn it over. When you think about M&A outside of core Uniform Rental and the businesses you're in. What are some of the metrics you're looking at? I know you want to touch more businesses. I assume it's our base. Does it have to be accretive to growth, accretive to margin? I know you guys just did shred it a long time ago and that business got sold. We did G&K that was part of the core. Just any color as to metrics you can share, how you think of our larger M&A outside the core? Thank you.\nMike Hansen: First of all, we work for B2B. We love the recurring revenue nature of our kinds of businesses. Route based is preferred but it's not absolutely necessary. The key is what kind of service, can we add to provide some level of value to the customer. So that's the real key. We would want it to be an opportunity that can add value to many of our customers, not just a small subset, and we would want it to have margin potential. So you asked, does it need to be growth accretive and margin accretive. We certainly would love it to be, but there really aren't that many out there, we're looking hard for them. But those are the kind of things that we will look for. Recurring revenue streams, can it benefit our current customers, is it a large opportunity for us, or is it very narrow, what's the service component.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Manav Patnaik at Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: My first question is just can you just walk us through why the lower CapEx assumption and then maybe just some context when you look at the -- over the next two to three years, I guess where are your greatest investment means?\nMike Hansen: We -- generally, we are making our CapEx in terms of our growth opportunities, like new routes and then -- and adding capacity. I would say we continue to add the routes. So in other words, buying trucks and that is certainly important for us. But as it relates to laundry capacity, for example, we've got some really interesting projects that are going on that that we think can help us out in certain cases. And so, we're seeing a little bit of a benefit because of that. I've talked a little bit about G&K auto source that that's kind of a quasi auto source that helps us in certain facilities. And we're moving on rolling out some of those kind of things. We're looking at things like efficiency in the wash alley. And then we certainly still have a little bit of the capacity that we have gotten from the G&K acquisition. So, the combination of all of those things has created efficiency opportunities for us, particularly in the production environment, and you're seeing a little bit of that benefit in our gross margin.\nManav Patnaik: And then just in terms of G&K and maybe tied to the SAP implementation. Are there systems I guess on SAP as well? And is it still too hard for you guys to quantify any revenue synergies that you might be getting from that deal?\nMike Hansen: Well, keep in mind we converted all G&K locations to either the Cintas SAP system or the legacy Cintas system, so that we could fully get off of that system. And that was completed, gosh, probably over a year ago. And so we still have some of those that need to get from the Cintas legacy system to SAP. And so we inserted those locations as it made sense into the SAP rollout. And so we're almost there. Paul said we're 85% of the way there in total in terms of the conversion and we made good progress. So we have a pretty good handle on in terms of viewing the G&K legacy locations in much the same way that we're viewing the Cintas location. And so we see some benefits, so I would call them anecdotal. We need to get all the way on SAP before we really start taking advantage of the power of that information.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Mike, you mentioned that you just treat G&K legacy locations like Cintas locations. Want to know about the inventory? I mean, how much of the uniforms today are still the G&K uniforms? And when you convert over and introduce Cintas uniforms, which are presumably better uniforms. G&K legacy customers, how they responded and has there been a price adjustment since they are getting better uniforms?\nMike Hansen: From an inventory conversion standpoint, we are in the midst of that. And those happened at different such times, Andrew. So for example, if we have a customer that's got 10 wears, for example, in legacy G&K inventory, we maybe in a style where as they turn, in other words, as they have turnover and they replace their open positions with new hires and we put them into legacy G&K current garments, there's going to be a point in time at which we run out of those garments, whether it's the style or the size. And that happens at very different intervals depending on the kind of garment that they have. And so it is a customer-by-customer approach. When they start to run out of -- when we start to run out of G&K legacy garments, we will start to put them into Cintas garments and generally, that can be all at once, because we don't want them to have different looks. But as I said, that is a customer-by-customer decision point based on the style. So, it's really hard to give you a full percentage, because it's happening all over the country. We are not finished with that. We are still working our way through G&K legacy inventory. When they get on to Cintas inventory, as you know, pricing becomes a customer-by-customer conversation as well. And there may be some where we -- there is no change at all and we put them in something that's, let's say, at a work wear type of a garment. There may be others where we give them an opportunity to upgrade into a Carhartt garment, for example. And in that case, there may be times where we will increase the pricing, or adjust the pricing as its necessary. So it is a customer-by-customer decision on when to convert and then it's also a customer-by-customer decision on what does that pricing and what does that contract look like.\nAndrew Steinerman: And do you think the customer recognizes that the Cintas uniform on average is a better uniform than the legacy uniforms they had?\nMike Hansen: I can give you anecdotally, the answer is yes. We need to be doing a pretty good job of showing why they're moving into a Cintas garment, and what are the features and functions of that new garment. It may be that it's softer, it may be that it little bit better, it maybe that is -- that the fabric breath is a little bit better. And generally when we explain those kinds of features to the customer, they get it and they understand. And it doesn't take very long for them to be in those garments to recognize that there's a quality difference.\nOperator: We'll now take the next question from Gary Bisbee at Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGary Bisbee: I guess the first question from me, just the Uniform Rental revenue slowed somewhat, obviously, at a much tougher comp, but anything other than that. I guess you mentioned a little weaker energy, anything other than that you would call out as sequential deceleration in the organic constant currency revenue growth?\nMike Hansen: Yes, I don't think it's anything of real significance. But I would point to the three things I mentioned earlier; a little bit of the absence of that lapping; a little bit of the choppiness in the energy and maybe industrials, generally; and pricing maybe wasn't quite as incrementally positive as we've seen in previous two quarters. I think those things kind of capture what we saw in the quarter. Still a good quarter for us, but I think those things capture.\nGary Bisbee: And then you have been asked for a few years about cross-sell potential, both with G&K and just more broadly against your different businesses. And I realized you don't have the data and haven't provided real granular color. But, can you give us any sense like as your salespeople for the main business go out, how often are they targeting people that are customers through your other businesses? How important is cross-sell in terms of how you are trying to compensate the different types of sales people? Is it really something you focused a lot on to-date or should we think that the data that SAP will provide is really going to be the key to unlocking that more broadly?\nMike Hansen: We do spend a lot of time with that today, Gary. You know our SSRs are looking for opportunities. We have our, we call them market development reps, who are looking at that some of our more complex customers and looking for upsell and penetration opportunities there. And we've become a bit better at cross-sell between Rental and First Aid and Fire. I think we still have some ways to go there to take advantage of all of that opportunity. But we are starting to spend more time than in the past. So it has been important to us. And I think we've been doing a pretty good job at that over the last two years, including in the last probably 18 months with G&K legacy customers. But having said that, SAP will unlock some additional potential that is going to be something that should prove to be a nice opportunity for us.\nGary Bisbee: And then just one more, the initiative have been next quarter or anything like that, but as we think out of the next few years in sort of a normalized economy. How are you thinking about incremental operating margins these days? What's the potential? They have been obviously terrific the last two years, particularly as the G&K savings have flown through. But what's like a long-term target or opportunity there?\nMike Hansen: We still like -- we talk a lot about incrementals of 20% to 30%. We're getting pretty darn close to the bottom of that with our rental division. But as we continue to get success with penetration opportunities, to get success in some of the verticals that can be even bigger types of customers with a service opportunity that's more efficient, we think there are still opportunities. And that incremental, as we move forward, we think that incremental certainly is in the 20% to 30%. And if we can capitalize on some of those different things that we've talked about, the penetration, the sales into these customers with maybe more efficient service aspects, the capacity efficiencies, we think we can get that incremental into that mid-20 type of a neighborhood. So it's a nice opportunity that looks -- that we look forward to.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Andrew Wittmann at RW Baird. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Wittmann: Yes, I was looking at the two year growth rate stack in your Rental segment. It looks like the comps prove out at 12.4 over the last two years, both for the first quarter and the second quarter. But kind of brings me to the question you've talked about in the past, which is your sales force productivity. You mentioned the kind of the headwind for the deceleration in the growth rate. But I was just wondering how the sales force is performing for you? I think it was not that many quarters ago, you said even the G&K people that you kept on were producing at record levels. Can you just give us an update, Mike, about what you're seeing out of them in terms of the ability to add for those new customers?\nMike Hansen: Yes, when we think about total, look, we have one sales team. And so that sales team continues to perform well. And they're doing a nice job of adding customers and selling into existing customers. Their productivity levels are still, this quarter was a little bit higher than last year in this quarter. So, we're still making some really nice improvements. So we are still very pleased with the sales rep productivity.\nAndrew Wittmann: And then I guess I wanted to maybe, Paul, if you can just help us a little bit on some of the elements of cost structure. I think typically you've given energy as a percentage of your rental segment revenue. How much of a benefit was that? And just any other details that you can call in the cost structure? I think, labor has been something that people have flagged, maybe that would be something you've addressed. You mentioned health care that is back to normal. But just anything else you can help us understand the moving pieces inside the margins, I think could be helpful?\nPaul Adler: Yes, Andy. Energy was a 20 basis points benefits year-over-year, flat sequentially. So, I think that's -- if oil continues the price per barrel in the second half where it is in the first half, it will be little bit of a tailwind for us and the cost structure in the second half. Labor, I would say overall in checks, we talked about, gosh, it was probably a year ago now about certain areas of our workforce, particularly in the production area, we were having some labor inflation and we've made some changes. So we believe that that is behind us, and we won't have to make any further adjustments there. But otherwise, inflation is normal, I would say. It's something that we've been able to deal with. It's certainly tight, but it hasn't prevented us from running the business and serving our customers.\nMike Hansen: Yes. And Andy, when you think about our gross margins, for example, we've seen some really nice year-over-year improvement in this first half of the year. And certainly, the growth levels have been good and that helps. So, we're getting really nice leverage. Our sales people are productive and they're selling good profitable business, and that's been good. And we are -- we've done a nice job of capturing the G&K synergies. But what we're also seeing a little bit of is, as we've talked about over the last few years, there is a lot of inefficiency in running the facilities when you're going through a lot of conversion of incorporating G&K volumes into Cintas legacy plants and closing those plants and rebarcoding inventory. And there's a lot of work that goes on there. And really what we've seen in the first half of the year is we've captured those G&K synergies just as we wanted them to. And we've seen some real nice efficiency gains, because there are quite as many of those projects going on, those are a little bit more in the past. And so our -- we've -- the timing for us has been kind of fortunate and good from the standpoint of when we were seeing a little bit of pressure in our production labor, for example, we were also making some synergies and capturing some synergies there too. And we've been able to get more efficient in this first half of the year, and I think that's a little bit of what you're seeing.\nOperator: And we'll now take next question from Scott Schneeberger at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Hultberg: It's Daniel on for Scott. You discussed efficiencies earlier. Could you provide a little bit more perspective on some type of efficiencies to pursue want to go-forward basis besides the route optimization and a little bit color on automation of processes and use the advanced technology and how that is applied and where you could go there with? Thank you.\nMike Hansen: Sure. We are always looking for them. And so when we think about efficiencies going forward, I've talked a little bit about capacity. How can we continue to get more efficient in terms of using our Wash Alley, some of that is automation, I'm sorry, technology and some of that is a Six Sigma like process improvement there are opportunities there. We still have a lot of route optimization to go, that is both a little bit of technology, but just its customer touching and so we're being cautious in that regard. We've talked about getting through the SAP conversion and as we are able to then pull off of the legacy Cintas system a bit. That's going to create some efficiency just that because we won't have duplicate systems, but also then using that technology for things like sales rep productivity gains and cross-selling and penetration opportunities, so that we do have a number of those different efficiency opportunities as well as then just typically the Six Sigma processes that we're always working on and how can we get better and as the business changes can we get more efficient in the way we move product and through our plants and provide services. We're looking at all of those different things, but we think we've got some nice opportunities ahead.\nDaniel Hultberg: Switching gears a little bit, cotton price has been down in the first half of this fiscal year on a year-over-year basis. Could you please discuss half of that is impacting earnings. I mean I know historically you've smooth that out through amortization, but how is that really impacting your earnings presently? Thank you.\nMike Hansen: Not really any impact in the first half of this year. We are, as you mentioned, it takes a while for that cotton price to ripple through into our P&L, if we have to sell the garments, we have to bring the garments into our distribution center. We then ship them from our distribution centers out to our rental locations, and at that point they start an 18 months amortization process, so it takes a while. And then even when it does get through, we're generally smoothing that out as you said, because we've got, if we see a spike for a few months, you might have 118 fourth of that in one month, you may could have two or 318th fourth of that. It's got to be sustained movement in that before it really starts to hit us and keep in mind cotton isn't a -- it's not one of the more significant pieces of our cost structure. So if you think about our cost structure, our cost of rentals is you can think of it in three buckets, one is material cost, one is production, part of this running of our laundry facilities and the third is our service costs, so the routing. The cotton piece is then part of that material cost, but that material cost includes also the labor content to serve garments, the freight on the garments, the trim on the garments, etc. And so it really takes some sustained large movement in cotton before it really starts to impact us.\nOperator: We'll take the next question from George Tong at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Your revenue outlook has certainly improved from where it was a quarter ago, you discussed the macro factors that are impacting this, but can you elaborate on some internal initiatives where you're seeing traction that improves your revenue expectations for the full year?\nMike Hansen: Well, there they are -- things generally George that, that we've been working on for a while and that is we are looking to continuously focus on some of the verticals that have been really powerful for us. So for example, the healthcare vertical, the education government hospitality, those places where the sales are a little bit more complex, the purchasing decisions might be a little bit more complex and we've made some really good progress in those areas and we still are in the early innings and think there are great opportunities as we move ahead. And so those are areas that are really important to us. The penetration, I mentioned that we have been working more on the penetration opportunities. I think we can get better and more opportunities ahead for that area as well and that penetration is both better coordination between our businesses, but also taking advantage of our newer products and making sure we're getting things like check works in front of all of the right decision makers. And so it's really continuing to move forward with what we believe to be our unique products that create opportunity in the marketplace. We are doing the same kinds of things in our First Aid and Safety business where we are looking for those penetration opportunities, product adjacencies are great and continue to look for larger national type customers as well, in both First Aid and our Fire businesses. So we're doing all of those things. We've made some really nice progress. And we think we've got a really nice year ahead of us as we move into the second half.\nGeorge Tong: Your gross margins expanded about 110 basis points year-over-year in the quarter, can you discuss how much pricing contributed to this margin expansion and how sustainable pricing increases are at the current pace?\nMike Hansen: Pricing, certainly has an impact, I mentioned that it wasn't quite incrementally positive in this quarter as it had been in the previous two quarters. And so I would say the pricing is somewhat in line with what we've seen over the last couple of years, absent the last couple of quarters. Generally, we've been able to when we can show value and when we can have the right conversations with our customers. Generally, we've been able to get some pricing and I don't see that necessarily changing. But I would -- as it relates to then the margin opportunity and the margin improvement. It's really more about the growth creates leverage, it creates efficiencies in our plants, when we grow in our rental business in particular where we don't use capacity like our restroom and hygiene products, we effectively get some really nice leverage and get more efficient with the capacity. And in addition to that we've pulled out a little bit of inefficiency in the business, so more of the gross margin improvement relates to the revenue of the business, the leveraging and the efficiencies that we're able to gain.\nOperator: And we'll take the next question from Kevin McVeigh at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKevin McVeigh: Just to follow-up on the guidance a little bit, I know last year there was some severe weather in the third quarter that was kind of unexpected. Do you have any kind of just thoughts on or any allowance for that in the Q3 guide obviously with -- obviously which would be incorporated into the full year or how are you thinking about just the weather impact as we work our way through the back half of the year?\nMike Hansen: Last year in the third quarter, we talked a little bit about the weather and the holidays. It's hard to predict the weather. And so we are -- I would say, we're not trying to build in any particular weather pattern. As it relates to the holidays, one of the things we talked about last year was Christmas and New Year's falling on a Tuesday, which was the first time in a number of years and that has an impact. This year, the holidays both fall on a Wednesday, and the last time they fell on a Wednesday, I think it was like our fiscal '14 year. So it's been a bit of a time period since we've had a Wednesday. And so if you think about our weekly flow of volume you can think of it as a bit of a bell curve Monday -- Mondays and Friday's I would call are our, maybe our lower days and our as you go from Monday to Tuesday that when the volume starts to build because customers are just more, they're more easy to see etc. Wednesday tends to be one of our heavier days, and then you start to come back down as you go through the rest of the week. With -- by the holidays, both being on a Wednesday, this year we are considering that we will have any year-over-year benefit because of the comments we made last year during the holidays. We're kind of thinking that look, we're going to still have that holiday disruption a little bit. I don't think it necessarily will be a drag on growth, but it's certainly, it isn't going to help us with an easier comp.\nKevin McVeigh: And then just the margins again really nice and if I have it right, it looks like kind of the other category at least outpaced our estimates that can be kind of uniform sales which are lower margin. Is there anything else in there that's helping boost the gross margins overall despite the mix?\nMike Hansen: We are continuing to make improvements in the fire business. We really like that business and it has performed very well in the second quarter and in the first half. And as we get bigger and we gain scale and that revenue growth allows us to leverage our infrastructure a bit better. It creates more dense routes and that creates some margin opportunity. We've got a long way to go. But certainly have seen some nice performance in the fire business and certainly the heavy volume in our direct sale business was a bit of a help too.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Seth Weber at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSeth Weber: Most of the questions asked and answered, but I wanted to see if we could dig into your -- you've made the pricing comments a few times now, just a little bit less robust than maybe what we saw in the first quarter, is there anything you'd call out, is it a mix issue or the comps just getting harder or is there something going on from a competitive front that you would highlight? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: I think it's a bunch of different things, Seth. I think there is a little bit of mix going on. We've had some good performance in a few quarters in a row now, and if that's kind of outperformance isn't sustainable in the long term, and I don't think it's anything that we are concerned about. But just something a little bit of maybe a notch below where we had seen in the last couple of quarters, made up of a number of different things.\nSeth Weber: And then just on working capital has been frankly better than what we would have thought given the growth trajectory. I mean do you think that working capital can continue to be just a little bit better than normal. Normally, I think you expect to see a little bit more usage here. Has there something you'd call out that's really helping that or can we expect that to continue? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Well, look from a working capital standpoint, we certainly have been in a period of disruption over the last couple of years, as it relates to our accounts receivable converting two systems as it relates to our inventory and shutting down DCs, opening new DCs, converting a lot of volume. And we're starting to get some of those inefficiencies and disruptions behind us. And so for example in accounts receivable, we've seen a nice improvement year-over-year and that's part because we've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us. There still is some system conversion to go, but we think we're getting a little bit better and better and more efficient at it. If you think about the sort of cash flow for a second, when you think about our operating cash flow, it was pretty strong this quarter and really for the first six months of the year and our conversion of net income to operating cash flow has been over 100%. I would expect that that's going to continue for the second half of the year. Free cash flow was really strong and I think that's going to be strong for the rest of the year. And so I think more than anything Seth, it's getting a little bit of this disruption of two system conversions, a new business conversion, a little bit of that stuff behind us. But as we've talked in the past, when we are growing we're generally going to use some working capital, in other words, we're going to see AR continue to increase. We're going to see, generally speaking, inventory and in service inventories grow over time, inventory is a little bit different from a standpoint of we do have opportunities there, where some of those opportunities will create more inventory. For example, if we believe we can have enough volume to bring new products into our distribution center that may create new inventory. However, as we get more efficient and you get the G&K conversion behind us, that's going to create some forecasting and supply chain opportunities. So there's going to be some ups and downs in that inventory line item, but generally the performance has been good. We've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us, but we're generally going to be a user of the working capital.\nOperator: It appears there are no further questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to the speakers. Please go ahead.\nMike Hansen: Well, thanks very much joining us tonight. We will issue our third quarter financial results in March, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. And we wish you all happy holidays.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Good evening. And thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was a record $1.84 billion, an increase of 7.3% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was also 7.3%. In the second quarter of fiscal '20, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 5.8%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 10.6%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $852.4 million increased 10%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46.2% for the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 130 basis points from last year's second quarter to 46.6%, and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin improved 40 basis points to 48.4%. Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $334.5 million increased 21.3%. Operating margin was 18.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16% in fiscal '19. Operating income in the second quarter of fiscal '19 was impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $7.8 million or 50 basis points. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was $246.4 million and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.27. Excluding the one-time gain on the sale of a cost method investment and the G&K acquisition integration expenses, both in fiscal '19, EPS increased 29%. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer who's quoted in today's earnings press release, we are pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance. We thank our employee partners for continuing to execute well and take great care of our customers. In addition to the strong financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. On December 6th, we paid an annual dividend of $2.55 per share, an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividends. We've increased the dividend for 36 consecutive years. In the past 10 years, the annual dividend per share increased at a compound annual growth rate of 18.2%. Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide an update of our fiscal '20 expectations. We have increased our expectations of financial performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.29 billion to $7.33 billion. We expect EPS to be in the range of $8.65 to $8.75. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5.8% for 6.4%. However, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate range at guidance is 6.2% to 6.8%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS, reducing it about $0.06, which is 90 basis points drag on the EPS growth rate. Adjusting for this, the EPS growth rate range is 14.7% to 16%. Guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 19.2% compared to a rate of 19.7% for fiscal '19. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. It assumes a share counts for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. The guidance does not assume any future share buybacks or any additional G&K integration expenses. I'll now turn the call over Paul. And Toni, you are speaking of revenue right now. Correct? And so, from a -- let's talk about the quarter. We had a very good quarter. The -- all of our businesses grew, and in particular our direct sale business had a really nice quarter. Toni, you'd asked a little bit about the macro first. And I would say not a lot of change during the quarter. We did say at the beginning of the quarter that energy, we were starting to see a little bit of softness in the energy area. We did see a little bit of that during the quarter. In fact, we had one fairly good sized customer in the space go bankrupt. But I would say, the other thing is, industrials are a bit choppy, generally speaking. Having said that, not a lot of change during the quarter. We are encouraged, as we kind of forward, we are encouraged that we've -- it looks like we've made some progress in the USMCA and China trade and we're encouraged by the movement there and we look forward to getting those results. It seems like we seen a little bit of a steady direction out of the Fed on interest rates. And so, as we leave the second quarter, I would say there are some encouraging signs, but there's still we're entering the election year, there still is a lot going on in terms of the noise in the marketplace, and whether or not small business and other businesses will continue to invest. And so we still look a little bit with caution as we think about the second half of the year. As it relates to the guidance, look, we had a very good first half of the year. Our partners did a great job, and the year is playing out generally as we expected. We had growth of roughly 7%. Organic growth of over 7% for the first half of the year, but we also have some things that went our way. I talked a little bit about this in the first quarter where rental probably got a little bit of year-over-year benefit in the first quarter and that certainly helped as we kind of were finding the bottom last year in our rental business as we've lapped the G&K acquisition. So again, a little bit of benefit in the first half there. We talked about pricing being incrementally positive in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, maybe not quite as incrementally positive in the second quarter but certainly, some benefit in the first half of the year. I would expect that that we'll fall back into kind of the pricing range we've been in the last few years. When you think about the Direct Sale business, we talked about that, we referred of that a few times, had a great year in the first half. In the second half, our expectation is, as this business can be lumpy that we'll be flat to down in that. And so just that alone is about 75 basis points of growth impact when you compare the first half to the second half. I talked a little bit about the outlook on the macro. And so as we think about the second half, we're thinking about the macro. We're thinking about -- there are some things that really went well in the first half, may not get all of that benefit in the second half. Having said all of that, look, it's -- our same work day growth is 6.2 to 6.8, and the year is shaping up pretty much the way we expected it to. And if we can hit those kind of numbers, that's a really nice year for us. Yes, we do have -- we've got the authorization of about 1.2 billion. And we look at that, as we talked about, we look at that opportunistically. One thing to keep in mind is we, in the first week of December, we made $268 million payment related to our dividend, and we also have some debt interest payments. So we're back into CP in the month of December, but we will look at the buyback opportunistically as we move through the rest of the year. And specifically to your question, we have not made any changes to the way we think about capital allocation. Hamza, we're about 85% of the way through our SAP journey at this point in time, so we've made some good progress in the quarter. And we're still on track to complete the project by the end of the fiscal year. As far as benefits are concerned, I think the benefits from SAP are going to be kind of throughout the P&L. We've talked about some of them already that that can be achieved by locations individually, better technology in the hands of the people providing the services, better information at their disposal, the ability for our accounting and finance people and operations people to look at data from the very back of the house all the way to invoicing and pricing with the customer. But then there are other benefits to that that we believe will be benefiting the top-line later on and more perhaps impactfully when the entire network is in the system. But certainly, we believe that putting the Uniform Rental business and our First Aid business in the same operating system will foster more collaboration, more cross-selling, which will help the top-line. And just better, as I mentioned earlier, use the data, looking at our big, large national accounts, from city-to-city-to city to do analyses and make sure that we're getting all the entitled revenue that we should for the agreements, make sure the pricing is appropriate for the contract. So lots of opportunities, but not able to quantify anything at this point in time. As I said, we'll complete that rollout this fiscal year and have more color next fiscal year for you. First of all, we work for B2B. We love the recurring revenue nature of our kinds of businesses. Route based is preferred but it's not absolutely necessary. The key is what kind of service, can we add to provide some level of value to the customer. So that's the real key. We would want it to be an opportunity that can add value to many of our customers, not just a small subset, and we would want it to have margin potential. So you asked, does it need to be growth accretive and margin accretive. We certainly would love it to be, but there really aren't that many out there, we're looking hard for them. But those are the kind of things that we will look for. Recurring revenue streams, can it benefit our current customers, is it a large opportunity for us, or is it very narrow, what's the service component. We -- generally, we are making our CapEx in terms of our growth opportunities, like new routes and then -- and adding capacity. I would say we continue to add the routes. So in other words, buying trucks and that is certainly important for us. But as it relates to laundry capacity, for example, we've got some really interesting projects that are going on that that we think can help us out in certain cases. And so, we're seeing a little bit of a benefit because of that. I've talked a little bit about G&K auto source that that's kind of a quasi auto source that helps us in certain facilities. And we're moving on rolling out some of those kind of things. We're looking at things like efficiency in the wash alley. And then we certainly still have a little bit of the capacity that we have gotten from the G&K acquisition. So, the combination of all of those things has created efficiency opportunities for us, particularly in the production environment, and you're seeing a little bit of that benefit in our gross margin. Well, keep in mind we converted all G&K locations to either the Cintas SAP system or the legacy Cintas system, so that we could fully get off of that system. And that was completed, gosh, probably over a year ago. And so we still have some of those that need to get from the Cintas legacy system to SAP. And so we inserted those locations as it made sense into the SAP rollout. And so we're almost there. Paul said we're 85% of the way there in total in terms of the conversion and we made good progress. So we have a pretty good handle on in terms of viewing the G&K legacy locations in much the same way that we're viewing the Cintas location. And so we see some benefits, so I would call them anecdotal. We need to get all the way on SAP before we really start taking advantage of the power of that information. From an inventory conversion standpoint, we are in the midst of that. And those happened at different such times, Andrew. So for example, if we have a customer that's got 10 wears, for example, in legacy G&K inventory, we maybe in a style where as they turn, in other words, as they have turnover and they replace their open positions with new hires and we put them into legacy G&K current garments, there's going to be a point in time at which we run out of those garments, whether it's the style or the size. And that happens at very different intervals depending on the kind of garment that they have. And so it is a customer-by-customer approach. When they start to run out of -- when we start to run out of G&K legacy garments, we will start to put them into Cintas garments and generally, that can be all at once, because we don't want them to have different looks. But as I said, that is a customer-by-customer decision point based on the style. So, it's really hard to give you a full percentage, because it's happening all over the country. We are not finished with that. We are still working our way through G&K legacy inventory. When they get on to Cintas inventory, as you know, pricing becomes a customer-by-customer conversation as well. And there may be some where we -- there is no change at all and we put them in something that's, let's say, at a work wear type of a garment. There may be others where we give them an opportunity to upgrade into a Carhartt garment, for example. And in that case, there may be times where we will increase the pricing, or adjust the pricing as its necessary. So it is a customer-by-customer decision on when to convert and then it's also a customer-by-customer decision on what does that pricing and what does that contract look like. I can give you anecdotally, the answer is yes. We need to be doing a pretty good job of showing why they're moving into a Cintas garment, and what are the features and functions of that new garment. It may be that it's softer, it may be that it little bit better, it maybe that is -- that the fabric breath is a little bit better. And generally when we explain those kinds of features to the customer, they get it and they understand. And it doesn't take very long for them to be in those garments to recognize that there's a quality difference. Yes, I don't think it's anything of real significance. But I would point to the three things I mentioned earlier; a little bit of the absence of that lapping; a little bit of the choppiness in the energy and maybe industrials, generally; and pricing maybe wasn't quite as incrementally positive as we've seen in previous two quarters. I think those things kind of capture what we saw in the quarter. Still a good quarter for us, but I think those things capture. We do spend a lot of time with that today, Gary. You know our SSRs are looking for opportunities. We have our, we call them market development reps, who are looking at that some of our more complex customers and looking for upsell and penetration opportunities there. And we've become a bit better at cross-sell between Rental and First Aid and Fire. I think we still have some ways to go there to take advantage of all of that opportunity. But we are starting to spend more time than in the past. So it has been important to us. And I think we've been doing a pretty good job at that over the last two years, including in the last probably 18 months with G&K legacy customers. But having said that, SAP will unlock some additional potential that is going to be something that should prove to be a nice opportunity for us. We still like -- we talk a lot about incrementals of 20% to 30%. We're getting pretty darn close to the bottom of that with our rental division. But as we continue to get success with penetration opportunities, to get success in some of the verticals that can be even bigger types of customers with a service opportunity that's more efficient, we think there are still opportunities. And that incremental, as we move forward, we think that incremental certainly is in the 20% to 30%. And if we can capitalize on some of those different things that we've talked about, the penetration, the sales into these customers with maybe more efficient service aspects, the capacity efficiencies, we think we can get that incremental into that mid-20 type of a neighborhood. So it's a nice opportunity that looks -- that we look forward to. Yes, when we think about total, look, we have one sales team. And so that sales team continues to perform well. And they're doing a nice job of adding customers and selling into existing customers. Their productivity levels are still, this quarter was a little bit higher than last year in this quarter. So, we're still making some really nice improvements. So we are still very pleased with the sales rep productivity. Yes. And Andy, when you think about our gross margins, for example, we've seen some really nice year-over-year improvement in this first half of the year. And certainly, the growth levels have been good and that helps. So, we're getting really nice leverage. Our sales people are productive and they're selling good profitable business, and that's been good. And we are -- we've done a nice job of capturing the G&K synergies. But what we're also seeing a little bit of is, as we've talked about over the last few years, there is a lot of inefficiency in running the facilities when you're going through a lot of conversion of incorporating G&K volumes into Cintas legacy plants and closing those plants and rebarcoding inventory. And there's a lot of work that goes on there. And really what we've seen in the first half of the year is we've captured those G&K synergies just as we wanted them to. And we've seen some real nice efficiency gains, because there are quite as many of those projects going on, those are a little bit more in the past. And so our -- we've -- the timing for us has been kind of fortunate and good from the standpoint of when we were seeing a little bit of pressure in our production labor, for example, we were also making some synergies and capturing some synergies there too. And we've been able to get more efficient in this first half of the year, and I think that's a little bit of what you're seeing. Sure. We are always looking for them. And so when we think about efficiencies going forward, I've talked a little bit about capacity. How can we continue to get more efficient in terms of using our Wash Alley, some of that is automation, I'm sorry, technology and some of that is a Six Sigma like process improvement there are opportunities there. We still have a lot of route optimization to go, that is both a little bit of technology, but just its customer touching and so we're being cautious in that regard. We've talked about getting through the SAP conversion and as we are able to then pull off of the legacy Cintas system a bit. That's going to create some efficiency just that because we won't have duplicate systems, but also then using that technology for things like sales rep productivity gains and cross-selling and penetration opportunities, so that we do have a number of those different efficiency opportunities as well as then just typically the Six Sigma processes that we're always working on and how can we get better and as the business changes can we get more efficient in the way we move product and through our plants and provide services. We're looking at all of those different things, but we think we've got some nice opportunities ahead. Not really any impact in the first half of this year. We are, as you mentioned, it takes a while for that cotton price to ripple through into our P&L, if we have to sell the garments, we have to bring the garments into our distribution center. We then ship them from our distribution centers out to our rental locations, and at that point they start an 18 months amortization process, so it takes a while. And then even when it does get through, we're generally smoothing that out as you said, because we've got, if we see a spike for a few months, you might have 118 fourth of that in one month, you may could have two or 318th fourth of that. It's got to be sustained movement in that before it really starts to hit us and keep in mind cotton isn't a -- it's not one of the more significant pieces of our cost structure. So if you think about our cost structure, our cost of rentals is you can think of it in three buckets, one is material cost, one is production, part of this running of our laundry facilities and the third is our service costs, so the routing. The cotton piece is then part of that material cost, but that material cost includes also the labor content to serve garments, the freight on the garments, the trim on the garments, etc. And so it really takes some sustained large movement in cotton before it really starts to impact us. Well, there they are -- things generally George that, that we've been working on for a while and that is we are looking to continuously focus on some of the verticals that have been really powerful for us. So for example, the healthcare vertical, the education government hospitality, those places where the sales are a little bit more complex, the purchasing decisions might be a little bit more complex and we've made some really good progress in those areas and we still are in the early innings and think there are great opportunities as we move ahead. And so those are areas that are really important to us. The penetration, I mentioned that we have been working more on the penetration opportunities. I think we can get better and more opportunities ahead for that area as well and that penetration is both better coordination between our businesses, but also taking advantage of our newer products and making sure we're getting things like check works in front of all of the right decision makers. And so it's really continuing to move forward with what we believe to be our unique products that create opportunity in the marketplace. We are doing the same kinds of things in our First Aid and Safety business where we are looking for those penetration opportunities, product adjacencies are great and continue to look for larger national type customers as well, in both First Aid and our Fire businesses. So we're doing all of those things. We've made some really nice progress. And we think we've got a really nice year ahead of us as we move into the second half. Pricing, certainly has an impact, I mentioned that it wasn't quite incrementally positive in this quarter as it had been in the previous two quarters. And so I would say the pricing is somewhat in line with what we've seen over the last couple of years, absent the last couple of quarters. Generally, we've been able to when we can show value and when we can have the right conversations with our customers. Generally, we've been able to get some pricing and I don't see that necessarily changing. But I would -- as it relates to then the margin opportunity and the margin improvement. It's really more about the growth creates leverage, it creates efficiencies in our plants, when we grow in our rental business in particular where we don't use capacity like our restroom and hygiene products, we effectively get some really nice leverage and get more efficient with the capacity. And in addition to that we've pulled out a little bit of inefficiency in the business, so more of the gross margin improvement relates to the revenue of the business, the leveraging and the efficiencies that we're able to gain. Last year in the third quarter, we talked a little bit about the weather and the holidays. It's hard to predict the weather. And so we are -- I would say, we're not trying to build in any particular weather pattern. As it relates to the holidays, one of the things we talked about last year was Christmas and New Year's falling on a Tuesday, which was the first time in a number of years and that has an impact. This year, the holidays both fall on a Wednesday, and the last time they fell on a Wednesday, I think it was like our fiscal '14 year. So it's been a bit of a time period since we've had a Wednesday. And so if you think about our weekly flow of volume you can think of it as a bit of a bell curve Monday -- Mondays and Friday's I would call are our, maybe our lower days and our as you go from Monday to Tuesday that when the volume starts to build because customers are just more, they're more easy to see etc. Wednesday tends to be one of our heavier days, and then you start to come back down as you go through the rest of the week. With -- by the holidays, both being on a Wednesday, this year we are considering that we will have any year-over-year benefit because of the comments we made last year during the holidays. We're kind of thinking that look, we're going to still have that holiday disruption a little bit. I don't think it necessarily will be a drag on growth, but it's certainly, it isn't going to help us with an easier comp. We are continuing to make improvements in the fire business. We really like that business and it has performed very well in the second quarter and in the first half. And as we get bigger and we gain scale and that revenue growth allows us to leverage our infrastructure a bit better. It creates more dense routes and that creates some margin opportunity. We've got a long way to go. But certainly have seen some nice performance in the fire business and certainly the heavy volume in our direct sale business was a bit of a help too. I think it's a bunch of different things, Seth. I think there is a little bit of mix going on. We've had some good performance in a few quarters in a row now, and if that's kind of outperformance isn't sustainable in the long term, and I don't think it's anything that we are concerned about. But just something a little bit of maybe a notch below where we had seen in the last couple of quarters, made up of a number of different things. Well, look from a working capital standpoint, we certainly have been in a period of disruption over the last couple of years, as it relates to our accounts receivable converting two systems as it relates to our inventory and shutting down DCs, opening new DCs, converting a lot of volume. And we're starting to get some of those inefficiencies and disruptions behind us. And so for example in accounts receivable, we've seen a nice improvement year-over-year and that's part because we've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us. There still is some system conversion to go, but we think we're getting a little bit better and better and more efficient at it. If you think about the sort of cash flow for a second, when you think about our operating cash flow, it was pretty strong this quarter and really for the first six months of the year and our conversion of net income to operating cash flow has been over 100%. I would expect that that's going to continue for the second half of the year. Free cash flow was really strong and I think that's going to be strong for the rest of the year. And so I think more than anything Seth, it's getting a little bit of this disruption of two system conversions, a new business conversion, a little bit of that stuff behind us. But as we've talked in the past, when we are growing we're generally going to use some working capital, in other words, we're going to see AR continue to increase. We're going to see, generally speaking, inventory and in service inventories grow over time, inventory is a little bit different from a standpoint of we do have opportunities there, where some of those opportunities will create more inventory. For example, if we believe we can have enough volume to bring new products into our distribution center that may create new inventory. However, as we get more efficient and you get the G&K conversion behind us, that's going to create some forecasting and supply chain opportunities. So there's going to be some ups and downs in that inventory line item, but generally the performance has been good. We've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us, but we're generally going to be a user of the working capital. Well, thanks very much joining us tonight. We will issue our third quarter financial results in March, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. And we wish you all happy holidays."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwinds, using fiscal '19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses, like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats, are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. And we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19. Each quarter of fiscal '20 contains 65 workdays. In comparison to fiscal '19, our upcoming Q3 of fiscal '20 will have one additional day, and our Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All-Other. All-Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All-Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on ramp. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion, an increase for 5.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46.6% for the second quarter compared to 45.3% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of 130 basis points. Operating Income margin was a record 19.5% for the second quarter and it was 19% year-to-date. Profit margins have strengthened for many reasons including strong revenue growth and realization of profit synergies from the acquisition of G&K. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. The segment's revenue for the second quarter was $169.7 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 10.6%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 14.4% in the second quarter compared to 14% in masters second quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. First Aid segment gross margins continued to increase with strong revenue growth. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in all other categories. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and service from our other business units. All Other revenue was $204.1 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate was 16.5%. The Fire business organic growth rate was 9.6%. Uniform Direct Sales business saw an exceptionally strong quarter, posting an organic growth rate of 25%. Growth was driven in large part due to the rollout of Carhartt branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All Other gross margin was 41.8% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Improvement was realized in many areas, including lower G&A labor expense as a percentage of revenue. Last quarter, we mentioned that medical expense as a percent of revenue spiked. It came back in line in the second quarter as we expected. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.1%. Stock based compensation positively impacted the tax rate. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30th was $226.5 million. Year-to-date, operating cash flow increased about 66% from last year, because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $61.4 million. Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows; $48.6 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10.8 million in First Aid and Safety, and $2 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '20 CapEx to be in a range of $265 million to $290 million. As of November 30th, total debt was $2,738.4 million. $2,538.6 million was fixed interest rate debt and $199.8 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan. At November 30th, our leverage was 1.8 times debt-to-EBITDA. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Yes, Andy. Energy was a 20 basis points benefits year-over-year, flat sequentially. So, I think that's -- if oil continues the price per barrel in the second half where it is in the first half, it will be little bit of a tailwind for us and the cost structure in the second half. Labor, I would say overall in checks, we talked about, gosh, it was probably a year ago now about certain areas of our workforce, particularly in the production area, we were having some labor inflation and we've made some changes. So we believe that that is behind us, and we won't have to make any further adjustments there. But otherwise, inflation is normal, I would say. It's something that we've been able to deal with. It's certainly tight, but it hasn't prevented us from running the business and serving our customers."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.\nMike Hansen: Thank you, and good evening. Thanks for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was a record $1.81 billion, an increase of 6.7% over last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, was 8.3%. In the first quarter of fiscal '20, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 7.5%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 13.8%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '20 of $849.1 million, increased 9.6%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 46.9% for the first quarter of fiscal '20, compared to 45.6% in the first quarter of fiscal '19. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment gross margin as a percent of revenue improved 150 basis points from last year's first quarter to 47.2%. And the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 110 basis points to 49%. Reported operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '20 of $306.1 million increased 15.4%. Operating margin was 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20, compared to 15.6% in fiscal '19. Operating income in the first quarter of fiscal '19 was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $4.9 million, or 30 basis points. Reported net income for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was $250.8 million, and reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal '20 were $2.32. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 20.2%. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our start to our fiscal year. We thank our employee-partners for continuing to execute well on our important initiatives. Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide an update of our fiscal '20 expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.28 billion to $7.32 billion. We expect EPS to be in the range of $8.47 to $8.57. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5.6% to 6.2%. However, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate at guidance is 6% to 6.6%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS reducing it about $0.06, which is a 90 basis point drag on the EPS growth rate for the year. The guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 20.3% compared to a rate of 19.7% for fiscal '19. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal '20 negatively impacts EPS growth about 80 basis points and total EPS by about $0.06. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. The guidance assumes a share count for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. And it does not assume any future share buybacks, any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or any additional G&K integration expenses. I'll now turn the call over to Paul.\nPaul Adler: Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal '19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points, in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. And we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19. Each quarter of fiscal '20 will contain 65 workdays. In comparison to fiscal '19, our upcoming Q2 of fiscal '20 will have the same number of days. Q3 will have one additional day, and Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results. We have two reportable operating segments Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consist of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 5.8%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and differences in the number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 7.5%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 47.2% for the first quarter compared to 45.7% than last year's first quarter, an improvement of 150 basis points. Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.20% compared to 2.45% in the prior year quarter. The gross margin expansion was driven in large part by the strong revenue increase covering certain fixed production and service department costs. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $172.1 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 13.8%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 49.0% in the first quarter compared to 47.9% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. First Aid segment gross margins continue to increase with stop - with a strong top line growth. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All Other revenue was $184.5 million, an increase of 8.8%. The organic growth rate was 9.7%. The Fire business organic growth rate came in at 12.5%. Uniform Direct Sale business had a good quarter too, posting an organic growth rate of 5.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.8% for the first quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 42.9% for last year's first quarter. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.0% in the first quarter of fiscal '20, and 29.7% in the first quarter of '19. Lower labor expense as a percent of revenue was offset by increases in other expenses, particularly an 80 basis point increase in medical expense. We are self-insured and therefore subject to some volatility in medical expense from quarter-to-quarter. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was 10.1%. Stock based compensation positively impacted the tax rate. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period to period, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. Please note three new line items on our balance sheet, resulting in an increase in assets and liabilities by about $165 million. These relate to our adoption in the quarter of the Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, entitled Leases. The adoption does not have a material impact on net income or cash flow. Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $102.1 million. Operating cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal '20 increased about 70% from the amount of operating cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal '19, and benefited from strong earnings growth, and improvements in working capital. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $64.7 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows; $53.0 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8.1 million in the First Aid and Safety, and $3.6 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '20 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $310 million. As of August 31, total debt was $2,876.9 billion. $2,538.1 billion was fixed interest rate debt, and $338.8 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan and commercial paper. At August 31, our leverage of 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA was slightly lower than our target of 2x. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: The Uniform gross rental margins were really strong this quarter expanding by about 144 basis points. Was there anything one-time in there, or I guess how much could be attributable to synergies? And how should we think about the pacing of synergies this year?\nMike Hansen: Nothing really one-time. We did as Paul mentioned, we got a little bit of a benefit 25 basis points from energy. So we got a little bit of benefit there. The synergies - our expectation is that they will be generally consistent from quarter-to-quarter. So call it roughly $35 million. That would - if that happens, that will get us right through that $140 million for the year, which we - as we talked about a few months ago. We're going to be right around that range, $135 million to $140 million. And so we feel pretty good about our ability to capture those synergies. I would say the rest of it is nice execution, getting through a little bit more of the integration activities and seeing some efficiencies at play. The environment for pricing was similar to the fourth quarter where we sat a bit incrementally better than we had seen. So got a little bit of revenue help from that standpoint as well but not really any one-time items.\nToni Kaplan: And now that you've reached your target leverage, can you talk a little bit more about what you would look for in an acquisition? Would you prefer sort of domestic or international for uniform versus ancillary services? And lastly would you expect any regulatory issues just given your size at this point?\nMike Hansen: So from an M&A perspective, we love M&A and our - in the businesses that we're currently in, certainly. Anything from a tuck-in in our Fire, First Aid and Uniform Rental businesses to something larger. We certainly - if there were any M&A opportunities in our space, we certainly want to be involved and would have a great interest in - in pursuing that at the right value. And we certainly like from a geographic standpoint, it's easier to capture synergies for example, with acquisitions in the U.S. and Canada because we have a presence here, and it allows us to get density in markets to combine capacity if those opportunities present themselves. So we would prefer acquisitions where we can capture better synergies. Your last question of, do we expect any regulatory issues? That certainly depends on what type of acquisition and the size of that acquisition, but, let's assume a large acquisition in the workwear space for example. If one came available, we love to take a look at it. And when - I would say something that you may not be considering, others may not be considering is, we have so many people that look at our business from a served market perspective. And we view the market is so much bigger than that. So for example, we compete in the workwear space, there is a lot of competition in the workwear space. Some of our competitors in workwear are from a retail standpoint. So in other words, they simply sell workwear. Walmart and Amazon each sell over $5 billion annually of workwear. So they are large competitors in the space. And we have other competitors that provide workwear and design and shipping capabilities. They manage programs to a certain extent. So there are those kind of competitors. And we happened to provide workwear through manage programs. We source, we deliver, we maintain, we launder for our customers. And so there is a lot of competition in the space. We've kind of told you for many years, over 60% of our new business comes from no programmers. And who are those no programmers? They are retail space, they are direct sellers. They are people who do it themselves. But we've shown year after year, that we, that is part of our market space. Now we can also lose business to those kinds of - let's call it non-traditional competitors. My point in telling you all of this is, the opportunity is really large and much larger than our served market. And so, look, if there is an opportunity that's large in our space, we certainly would have interest, we want to understand it, it would have to be at the right value, and we'd have to - we'd have to articulate that competitive set, which we think is quite large.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.\nManav Patnaik: My first question is obviously, the first quarter growth was pretty impressive and well above your full year guidance ranges I guess. Could you just help us maybe walk through, if there is any quarterly cadences that we should be looking at?\nMike Hansen: Well. Sure. So maybe we'll start with the first quarter. We did have a really nice first quarter. Our non-rental businesses performed really well. Paul, maybe - Paul gave a little bit of comment on those, but maybe you can give a little bit more color on those business.\nPaul Adler: Yes, sure, Manav. So let's start like with First Aid. We mentioned the organic growth at 13.8%. That's a business that has executed very well. We typically expect organic growth to be in high single digits, maybe 10% is what we've talked about for that business. So they came in a little bit stronger. Of course, there is a lot of blocking and tackling a lot of variables that go into the performance in the quarter. But of note, we did have a new item that we rolled out in the quarter. A new item in the cabinet and it's kind of like a - kind of like a rollout of a direct sale program, for example in Uniform Direct Sale business where you're putting that into the cabinets, you get a lot of revenue, and then you're counting on some smaller trail of that revenue going on in the lapping quarter. So a little bit of a boost because of that new product rollouts, and so outlook for First Aid is going to be continuing to have a great year, but probably the latter quarters more in the high single digits where we historically have been. Fire. That business, impressive organic growth rate of 12.5%. Again a lot of pieces to that with execution of the sales force and great quality service. But they did have a little bit of an easier comp, Manav. I think their growth rates a year ago was about 8%, so little bit higher than 8%. So I think some of the 12.5% was a little bit of that easier comp. And in that business, the Fire business, there is really two types of revenue streams. There is a more reoccurring revenue stream that we call test and inspection, testing and inspecting fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems, et cetera. It tends to repeat more often. But we also have another revenue stream when things break, when alarms don't work, you have to perform repair and maintenance. And we had some national account repair and maintenance type revenue in the first quarter that was a little bit larger than we expected, and we don't expect that to repeat. So I think the 12.5% was a little bit higher than we typically expect. And then finally kind of rounding out the other business units. You'll note - well you can't - I mean we might have mentioned in the prepared remarks that the Direct Sale business had a good growth rate of 5.8%. A year ago, the growth rate was rather weak, in fact it actually had some shrinkage of about 1.8%. So that's a business that I think benefited from that easier comp in the first quarter. And as we've talked about previously in our prepared remarks that Direct Sale business is typically more of a 3% grower, long-term.\nMike Hansen: Yes. So, Manav when you look at the performance, I would say the non-rental businesses had great quarter, maybe outperformed our expectations a little bit, and probably don't expect that going forward. From a rental perspective, again had a really nice quarter. We had some really good execution by our rental partners. I mentioned a little bit of - the pricing was similar to the fourth quarter, which was incrementally good. So, got a little bit of benefit there. Probably got a little bit of a year-over-year benefit. Keep in mind, last year in the first quarter, that was our lowest organic growth. So we were - our volumes were still kind of finding the bottom. So probably got a little bit of benefit in that regard too. So as we look out over the next three quarters, we don't look at - we don't - there shouldn't be a lot of inconsistency in terms of the growth, but you know things can happen from quarter-to-quarter, but don't see a lot of movement from one quarter to the next for the rest of the year.\nManav Patnaik: And then if I could just ask in terms of the G&K revenue synergies. I know, I don't think you are looking to quantify anything. But any anecdotal color on, if you're starting to see that - the needle mover in terms of your results?\nMike Hansen: Well, we started talking about this a little bit. We saw signs of benefit in the first quarter of last year, and saw some nice execution throughout last fiscal year. And so we did see some benefits throughout last year and saw a little bit of that in the first quarter. As we move forward from a lapping perspective, I don't know that I would expect anything that is significant, but we're - it's something that we're constantly, every week that we visit those customers, we're talking with them, we're educating them on what we do, and sometimes these take time. And we're going to continue to cultivate those relationships as we go. I wouldn't expect any significant amounts in any one particular quarter. But it's certainly is a nice benefit for us.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: At this point, given the gross margins, is it fair to say and I know we\u2019re not just interviewing G&K. But is G&K up to the corporate average at this point, or would you expect that to continue to kind of narrow relative to where Cintas is relative to G&K?\nMike Hansen: Well, as you referred to, it's really hard to say. So for example, a lot of that G&K volume resides in legacy Cintas locations. So when you think about that volume, it certainly has helped us in those kinds of locations, create more capacity utilization, create little bit more density and so there certainly is a benefit. From stand alone locations, many of them have inherited some legacy Cintas volumes, but they're not quite to where we would see the rest of the Cintas legacy locations, but they're making nice progress. So we hope to continue to see improvements as we move forward.\nKevin McVeigh: And then just with the benefit from energy, was that - was there any organic growth headwind, i.e., would there have been maybe a benefit last year from surcharges and you don't have those surcharges, or it would have all been on the expense side?\nMike Hansen: We started to see a little bit of softening towards the end of the first quarter in the energy space. Keep in mind, it's not a big part of our revenue base, but we started to see a little bit of softness, I would say no headwind in the quarter from a revenue perspective. We're keeping our eyes on it though, as we move into the second quarter and beyond.\nKevin McVeigh: I guess, I'm sorry, I was thinking more in terms of fuel. You don't get the fuel surcharges. I know it sounded like you saw some relief from energy costs. I just wondered if that was a headwind on the revenue line.\nMike Hansen: Yes, I'm sorry, we don't have a fuel surcharge. So the energy, the gas prices, we don't flex our pricing or surcharges based on the price of the pump. I'm sorry, what I was referring to was our customers, in the oil, gas, mining areas that generally, when you see the prices of the gas at the pump come down in the past, when we've seen those prices really come down, it kind of hurts that business here in the U.S. And so the - we saw some benefit in that price of the pump as we said 25 basis points in rental. But we also saw a little bit of softening in the business side of it from a customer perspective. And so that's what we're keeping our eyes on. But we don't have a fuel surcharge. So no impact relative to that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nGary Bisbee: I guess you sort of alluded to this earlier in the commentary about some of the places where you saw strength this quarter, but clearly in the Rentals business you had a much easier comp on both organic revenue and margins in the year ago. And so I guess I just wanted to ask, is it right to think that that is a portion of the rentals business improvement and may be more significant than any sort of sequential improvement in momentum relative to what you were seeing this past spring? Is that fair?\nMike Hansen: So in other words, yes. Gary, I think your comment on, did we get some year-over-year benefit? Yeah, I think there was probably some of that, as you - as you alluded and I mentioned a minute ago. Our organic growth was still finding the bottom in terms of our volumes in rental and so there certainly is a little bit of year-over-year benefit there. And so I think that's - I think your commentary is reasonable.\nGary Bisbee: And then just thinking sequentially as we've moved over the last few months. Are you hearing anything different from your clients in the U.S. and Canada around the macro backdrop? Some of the forecasts for GDP growth in the U.S. are moderating, some of the industrial activities moderated a bit, though employment continues to be good. But any change in dialog or is it really steady as she goes?\nMike Hansen: Yes. We haven't heard much of a change from our customers and our first quarter results would kind of show that. When we think about the economic picture though as we move in - the last two quarters of our fiscal year are going into mid calendar '20. We do think about the noises around interest rates, the noises - the continued noises around trade and tariffs. We're going to be entering an election year where there is going to be a lot of noise, and I would say, we look today with a little bit more cautiousness than maybe earlier in the summer. And while we haven't seen much change from our customers yet, we're keeping our eyes on it because there's just so much noise in the environment today.\nGary Bisbee: And then just lastly, can you give us a sense, how much of the All Other segment is Fire versus Uniform sales? And really the reason I ask is, I think a lot of people have always just plugged in low single-digit growth because uniforms was always bigger, but it sounds like Fire keeps growing. Is that, understanding this volatility quarter-to-quarter, is it possible, that's really more should be a mid-single digit type grower, all in given that Fire is growing quickly and Uniform fairly moderately? Is that a fair assumption? And if you could give us the mix that would be great? Thank you.\nPaul Adler: Gary, it's Paul. I think that even in our 10-K, we actually have to break - I think the revenue recognition adoption of that FASB caused us to provide more detail. So you can take a look at the last 10-K and you'll see it. But my recollection is - and doing the math the last time that Fire is kind of like about 55% of the mix at this point in time, 45% then is the Direct sale business. And then to your point, we've tried to add some color that the Fire business is high single digits, 10% organic, whereas that Direct sale business is typically around 3%. Fire - the Fire business had a very good quarter. It improved gross margins and improved operating margins. But to your point, because of the fact that we lump those together for the accounting guidance, and we call it All Other, it blends this particular quarter to a little bit of a shrink in the gross margin by I think 10 basis points that was. But if that's more due to the - the mix shift and the fact that the direct sale business grew 5.8% and it shifts that mix and could cause that to move. But if you parse those two businesses out, Fire business actually improved their margins as I said.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.\nSeth Weber: Wanted to ask about working capital, it came down nicely relative to first quarter last year. Do you think you can kind of flip the negative? I think it was 2.60 or 2.75 or so for 2019. Do you think you can flip that all the way back to par this year? Or can you just talk to how you're thinking about working capital for 2020? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Yes, when we - our thoughts on working capital are when we are growing, we're going to use some working capital. So for example, if we're growing the way we want to grow. Accounts receivable is going to grow. Inventories are going to grow, in-service inventory is going to grow because we are injecting new inventory into new customers and penetrated customers. So generally speaking, we expect in a growth environment, we expect to use working capital. Now last year, in the first quarter, our use of working capital was quite larger than it was this year in the first quarter. So we were in the midst of a lot of system integration activity, a lot of G&K integration activity, and so we had some disruption in the accounts receivable environment. We feel really good about where we are today. And so you've seen a little bit of a less of a usage there, from an inventory perspective last year and an in-service inventory last year. When we make an acquisition like G&K, there are points in time at which we are going through inventory a little bit more quickly because we're transitioning out of legacy G&K inventory into Cintas types of inventory. Now that didn't happen all at once in the first quarter last year, but it certainly picked up. It continues today but certainly at a lesser pace. And so that's - there was a little bit disruption last year in the first quarter, a little bit more of a steady state this year in the first quarter, but we would expect continued use as long as we can continue to grow.\nSeth Weber: So the balance of the year probably look something like the balance of 2Q through - the balance of last year then. Is that a fair way to think about it?\nMike Hansen: Seth, I don't have the balance of last year right in front of me, but I would - generally speaking, yes. We wouldn't expect any - anything of a disruptive nature in those areas.\nSeth Weber: And then just follow up on the SG&A, I appreciate you calling out there were some extra expenses there for the quarter. So would you expect, assuming those don't recur SG&A to be down then year-over-year for the rest of the year? Yeah.\nMike Hansen: That certainly is our - yeah that certainly is our expectation. From a self-insurance standpoint, we've had quarters in the past where we'll see one time claims pop up and it results in a little bit of a higher insurance, medical expense than normal. Those may continue to happen. But generally speaking, we expect to see some nice leverage in SG&A, particularly from the G&A side of things. Paul mentioned that labor, G&A labor was down a little bit and we are very pleased with that. So we'll have disruptions from quarter-to-quarter. Generally speaking, we do expect leverage, no doubt.\nSeth Weber: And just, sorry, one last one for Paul, is tax rate kind of consistent here then for the balance of the year just spread evenly 2Q to 4Q?\nPaul Adler: Yes, that's reasonable, Seth, but it's just that Q1 that is so - such an outlier because of the stock option exercises. So I think that's good for modeling for the remainder of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Going back to organic revenue trends. How much of the acceleration in the quarter would you say is due to traction with penetration of the no programmer market versus improving adds, stops or easing competitive trends that you're seeing?\nMike Hansen: Yes, George, not a lot of difference from a normal quarter from the standpoint of new business continues to be strong, productivity from our reps was really good. And within that new business, set was a good no programmer performance. So new business continues to lead the growth effort. From adds, stops nothing to call out really. But, as I mentioned earlier, pricing in the quarter did help similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. So a little bit, certainly year-over-year help in that regard as well. So real nice sales productivity, little bit of pricing help, real nice execution from our partners.\nGeorge Tong: Your gross margins are continuing to improve across your segments. Can you elaborate on how your input costs are evolving and what your latest thoughts are around the impact of trade negotiations on the business?\nMike Hansen: Yes. So from a material costing standpoint, we haven't seen a lot of change right now. It seems like the trade and tariff conversation is more conversation than impact at this point, but it's still creating a lot of noise and uncertainty for our customers and us to a certain extent. But I haven't seen much of an impact. Keep in mind from a material perspective, most of our material costs get amortized over some period of time, whether it's the life of a garment or the life of a mat, and that amortization period really helps. It's a bit of a natural hedging that helps us smooth those kind of cost out. But I would say no costs to call out from that regard. Labor, we've talked over the course of the last year, we've seen it some pressure in pockets, and didn't see anything new or different in this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird.\nAndrew Wittmann: I just had a couple of maybe clarifying questions here. First just on the guidance, I think you guys - obviously the tax rate was low. We expected it to be low. I don't think you guys expected it to be quite this low. I'm just wondering how much of the tax rate was incremental or part of the guidance raise just to tease that element out of the total rates here versus your prior expectation?\nMike Hansen: Yes, I would say in the quarter it was about a $0.06 impact, for the year, probably about an $0.08 impact. And look, the - so much of that impact that we speak of is kind of out of our control. Well you've heard us talk about the equity piece of that and that's what kind of played out - that played the role in the first quarter here.\nAndrew Wittmann: And then just on SAP, in the past you've talked about how well rolled out or how thoroughly rolled out that is. Can you just kind of update us as to where we were either at the end of the quarter or where we stand today, Mike?\nMike Hansen: Yes, Andrew. It's - we're about 75% of the way complete now. And so we're still on track to finish that implementation by the end of the fiscal year.\nAndrew Wittmann: And then just for other detail here. You did some pretty good amount of buyback in the quarter. Can you give the total number of shares that you bought in and how much is remaining on the authorization that you currently have in place?\nMike Hansen: Yes. During the quarter, we - well, we have $263 million left on the authorization. We bought 837,000 shares for just under $200 million. Keep in mind that all of that purchasing was done prior to our July call. So it was - it did not have an impact on with the guidance that we gave you today.\nAndrew Wittmann: And then I guess just the only other question I had was specific around labor. You talked about SG&A kind of labor savings, but in the gross margin in the plant, this has been an area that's been cited maybe more by some of your competitors, but you guys have talked about it a little bit as well. I was just wondering if there is any changes that you've seen in the marketplace for your plant-level labor and how you're dealing with that today, if there is something to be dealt with?\nMike Hansen: Well, you're right. We've talked a little bit about pressures here and there in pockets particularly in that production and plant environment. And I would say, we didn't see much of a change. It remains a competitive environment and we got to do - the best thing we can do is, is keep our turnover - our partner turnover as low as possible. And we've been pretty successful at that. So I know, not much of a change in this first quarter compared to what we've seen over the course of the last year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: You're talking about M&A earlier in the call. Have you guys ever purchased a company that had unionized labor force and is that something that would be a non-starter for you? Or is that something that you would still entertain, if there is a lot of synergy potential?\nMike Hansen: Well, Shlomo, G&K had about 20% union workforce when we acquired them. A union environment, a different culture, it certainly creates a different type of environment to operating environment and those kind of things can tend to make synergy capture a little bit more challenging. And so at the end of the day, would we evaluate something with a heavy union component? You know that's a value consideration more than anything else. And we'd have to take a good hard look at it, because it does complicate the synergy capture opportunity. But there is - that's a part of the conversation around value and consideration.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: And then, did I hear you right that you did not buyback any more stock after the last earnings call?\nMike Hansen: Correct.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: And then could you just - is that usually - usually when companies don't buyback stock and their leverage is below the level that the - consider a target level there is usually something that is a potential out there, is that an unfair assumption for us to make that there might be something in the near to intermediate term?\nMike Hansen: Well, Shlomo, we've always looked at that buyback as we've executed as an opportunistic program. And if you go back over the course of the last 10 years, we are not consistent from quarter-to-quarter and that's by design. We kind of look at a bunch of different things. We look at the performance of the business, the investment needs of the business. We look at M&A opportunities on the horizon. We look at things like upcoming dividends and we have a consistent history of not being consistent in the way that we execute on that buyback program. And I'm not sure I look into anything more than that.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: And then if you just look at kind of the margins of the business. The First Aid and Safety had really good growth, margin expansion was not a whole lot there. Is there a lot of investment going on in terms of building out routes or anything like that that you're not seeing more leverage here?\nMike Hansen: Well, we had a real nice gross margin quarter with the gross margin being up 110 basis points. And so we're with that growth, we are continuing to invest in routes and in capacity. But really you're right Shlomo, from an investment standpoint, we did continue to invest in the SG&A space. And so we do see a little bit of an elevated SG&A number compared to last year. Keep in mind, they are also affected by the medical. And that was about an 80 basis point headwind. But you're right, we are continuing to invest in that business. We do really like it.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: And do you mind just going over the days in each quarter year-over-year? So we get that straight for the next three quarters.\nMike Hansen: Yes Shlomo, it's 65 in each quarter of this fiscal year. And then, let's see, compared to '19. So we had 66 in Q1 last year, then 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Thanks very much.\nScott Schneeberger: I just want to hone in a little bit more on pricing, you've mentioned a nice improvement from fourth quarter or at least still solid, which has improved from the third quarter. Could you delve in a little bit to the end markets where you're seeing that pricing improvement. Is there any competitive dynamic that's changed to affect that? And when I speak of end markets, also if you could just specify across the segments too, please. Thanks.\nMike Hansen: So from a market by market - from an end market perspective, and nothing to call out of any significance. You've heard us talk a little bit about the pricing environment over the years. When businesses in the rental business are performing well, when they are growing they have limited capacity and it generally tends to add a little bit of more readableness to the pricing environment, and so we do see a little bit of that going on. We also I think do a pretty good job of articulating to our customers, why at times pricing can be appropriate. And so I think that execution has been pretty good as well. So combination of the health of the marketplace, our ability to articulate I think that has combined to a nice environment.\nScott Schneeberger: And just following up on, in response to Manav's question early on in the Q&A, you were talking about a new item in the cabinet and how that could have a lumpy effect because the follow-on tapers a bit. I was just curious, how are you doing with opportunities like that rolling out and if you want to share what that new item was, that would be great. But how are you doing with deploying new offerings and servicing - services. And if you could tie that into G&K and if you're seeing any cross-sell benefit from there, that would be great? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: We do - we are seeing some cross-sell opportunities and benefits like we have over the course of the last year. And, but I would say generally speaking and we'd rather not call out that specific item, but generally speaking, we're always looking and investing for ancillary products ways that we can add some value for our customers. And so in this case, it was a nice benefit. Sometimes those happen in a particular quarter and didn't happen last year, they can be lumpy in terms of when the roll-outs occur, but we like where we are in terms of our ability to create those ancillary products within our businesses. That's what - we've talked many times about the umbrellas of image safety, cleanliness and compliance and when we think broadly like that with our customers, sometimes, we're able to come up with some pretty nice and unique ideas and we've been - we've had some success over the course of the last year, and that would go for legacy G&K customers as well as into legacy Cintas customers. We've had some nice success.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities.\nAndrew Steinerman: It's Andrew. Could you give a quick comment on merchandise amortization, was it a headwind or a tailwind in the first quarter? And given the strong new wins, do you feel like merchandise amortization will be more of a drag going forward to margins?\nMike Hansen: Yes, right. No, there was nothing to call out in that regard during the quarter. We are in an interesting time as I was mentioning earlier Andrew, where we've injected a decent amount of new Cintas product into legacy G&K customers, and that can create some rippling and we're going to see a little bit of that as we move forward, but less of it today than a year ago I would say. As we move forward, we're going to continue to sell, hopefully a lot of new business, and so we'll continue to inject at pretty good rates. But again, I would say nothing to call out. Our managers are managing the inventory and the in-service pretty well.\nAndrew Steinerman: Can I ask as you do inject, excuse me, inject Cintas uniforms into the G&K customer base, do they notice the - that there is a quality upgrade there?\nMike Hansen: We certainly would like to think so, I mean, when we look at the inventory, Andrew, our people understand the features and the functionality of the inventory in the garments that we have. And they are trained to point those features and functions out to our customers.

            "content": "Thank you, and good evening. Thanks for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was a record $1.81 billion, an increase of 6.7% over last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, was 8.3%. In the first quarter of fiscal '20, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 7.5%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 13.8%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '20 of $849.1 million, increased 9.6%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 46.9% for the first quarter of fiscal '20, compared to 45.6% in the first quarter of fiscal '19. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment gross margin as a percent of revenue improved 150 basis points from last year's first quarter to 47.2%. And the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 110 basis points to 49%. Reported operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '20 of $306.1 million increased 15.4%. Operating margin was 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20, compared to 15.6% in fiscal '19. Operating income in the first quarter of fiscal '19 was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $4.9 million, or 30 basis points. Reported net income for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was $250.8 million, and reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal '20 were $2.32. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 20.2%. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our start to our fiscal year. We thank our employee-partners for continuing to execute well on our important initiatives. Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide an update of our fiscal '20 expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.28 billion to $7.32 billion. We expect EPS to be in the range of $8.47 to $8.57. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5.6% to 6.2%. However, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate at guidance is 6% to 6.6%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS reducing it about $0.06, which is a 90 basis point drag on the EPS growth rate for the year. The guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 20.3% compared to a rate of 19.7% for fiscal '19. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal '20 negatively impacts EPS growth about 80 basis points and total EPS by about $0.06. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. The guidance assumes a share count for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. And it does not assume any future share buybacks, any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or any additional G&K integration expenses. I'll now turn the call over to Paul. Nothing really one-time. We did as Paul mentioned, we got a little bit of a benefit 25 basis points from energy. So we got a little bit of benefit there. The synergies - our expectation is that they will be generally consistent from quarter-to-quarter. So call it roughly $35 million. That would - if that happens, that will get us right through that $140 million for the year, which we - as we talked about a few months ago. We're going to be right around that range, $135 million to $140 million. And so we feel pretty good about our ability to capture those synergies. I would say the rest of it is nice execution, getting through a little bit more of the integration activities and seeing some efficiencies at play. The environment for pricing was similar to the fourth quarter where we sat a bit incrementally better than we had seen. So got a little bit of revenue help from that standpoint as well but not really any one-time items. So from an M&A perspective, we love M&A and our - in the businesses that we're currently in, certainly. Anything from a tuck-in in our Fire, First Aid and Uniform Rental businesses to something larger. We certainly - if there were any M&A opportunities in our space, we certainly want to be involved and would have a great interest in - in pursuing that at the right value. And we certainly like from a geographic standpoint, it's easier to capture synergies for example, with acquisitions in the U.S. and Canada because we have a presence here, and it allows us to get density in markets to combine capacity if those opportunities present themselves. So we would prefer acquisitions where we can capture better synergies. Your last question of, do we expect any regulatory issues? That certainly depends on what type of acquisition and the size of that acquisition, but, let's assume a large acquisition in the workwear space for example. If one came available, we love to take a look at it. And when - I would say something that you may not be considering, others may not be considering is, we have so many people that look at our business from a served market perspective. And we view the market is so much bigger than that. So for example, we compete in the workwear space, there is a lot of competition in the workwear space. Some of our competitors in workwear are from a retail standpoint. So in other words, they simply sell workwear. Walmart and Amazon each sell over $5 billion annually of workwear. So they are large competitors in the space. And we have other competitors that provide workwear and design and shipping capabilities. They manage programs to a certain extent. So there are those kind of competitors. And we happened to provide workwear through manage programs. We source, we deliver, we maintain, we launder for our customers. And so there is a lot of competition in the space. We've kind of told you for many years, over 60% of our new business comes from no programmers. And who are those no programmers? They are retail space, they are direct sellers. They are people who do it themselves. But we've shown year after year, that we, that is part of our market space. Now we can also lose business to those kinds of - let's call it non-traditional competitors. My point in telling you all of this is, the opportunity is really large and much larger than our served market. And so, look, if there is an opportunity that's large in our space, we certainly would have interest, we want to understand it, it would have to be at the right value, and we'd have to - we'd have to articulate that competitive set, which we think is quite large. Well. Sure. So maybe we'll start with the first quarter. We did have a really nice first quarter. Our non-rental businesses performed really well. Paul, maybe - Paul gave a little bit of comment on those, but maybe you can give a little bit more color on those business. Yes. So, Manav when you look at the performance, I would say the non-rental businesses had great quarter, maybe outperformed our expectations a little bit, and probably don't expect that going forward. From a rental perspective, again had a really nice quarter. We had some really good execution by our rental partners. I mentioned a little bit of - the pricing was similar to the fourth quarter, which was incrementally good. So, got a little bit of benefit there. Probably got a little bit of a year-over-year benefit. Keep in mind, last year in the first quarter, that was our lowest organic growth. So we were - our volumes were still kind of finding the bottom. So probably got a little bit of benefit in that regard too. So as we look out over the next three quarters, we don't look at - we don't - there shouldn't be a lot of inconsistency in terms of the growth, but you know things can happen from quarter-to-quarter, but don't see a lot of movement from one quarter to the next for the rest of the year. Well, we started talking about this a little bit. We saw signs of benefit in the first quarter of last year, and saw some nice execution throughout last fiscal year. And so we did see some benefits throughout last year and saw a little bit of that in the first quarter. As we move forward from a lapping perspective, I don't know that I would expect anything that is significant, but we're - it's something that we're constantly, every week that we visit those customers, we're talking with them, we're educating them on what we do, and sometimes these take time. And we're going to continue to cultivate those relationships as we go. I wouldn't expect any significant amounts in any one particular quarter. But it's certainly is a nice benefit for us. Well, as you referred to, it's really hard to say. So for example, a lot of that G&K volume resides in legacy Cintas locations. So when you think about that volume, it certainly has helped us in those kinds of locations, create more capacity utilization, create little bit more density and so there certainly is a benefit. From stand alone locations, many of them have inherited some legacy Cintas volumes, but they're not quite to where we would see the rest of the Cintas legacy locations, but they're making nice progress. So we hope to continue to see improvements as we move forward. We started to see a little bit of softening towards the end of the first quarter in the energy space. Keep in mind, it's not a big part of our revenue base, but we started to see a little bit of softness, I would say no headwind in the quarter from a revenue perspective. We're keeping our eyes on it though, as we move into the second quarter and beyond. Yes, I'm sorry, we don't have a fuel surcharge. So the energy, the gas prices, we don't flex our pricing or surcharges based on the price of the pump. I'm sorry, what I was referring to was our customers, in the oil, gas, mining areas that generally, when you see the prices of the gas at the pump come down in the past, when we've seen those prices really come down, it kind of hurts that business here in the U.S. And so the - we saw some benefit in that price of the pump as we said 25 basis points in rental. But we also saw a little bit of softening in the business side of it from a customer perspective. And so that's what we're keeping our eyes on. But we don't have a fuel surcharge. So no impact relative to that. So in other words, yes. Gary, I think your comment on, did we get some year-over-year benefit? Yeah, I think there was probably some of that, as you - as you alluded and I mentioned a minute ago. Our organic growth was still finding the bottom in terms of our volumes in rental and so there certainly is a little bit of year-over-year benefit there. And so I think that's - I think your commentary is reasonable. Yes. We haven't heard much of a change from our customers and our first quarter results would kind of show that. When we think about the economic picture though as we move in - the last two quarters of our fiscal year are going into mid calendar '20. We do think about the noises around interest rates, the noises - the continued noises around trade and tariffs. We're going to be entering an election year where there is going to be a lot of noise, and I would say, we look today with a little bit more cautiousness than maybe earlier in the summer. And while we haven't seen much change from our customers yet, we're keeping our eyes on it because there's just so much noise in the environment today. Yes, when we - our thoughts on working capital are when we are growing, we're going to use some working capital. So for example, if we're growing the way we want to grow. Accounts receivable is going to grow. Inventories are going to grow, in-service inventory is going to grow because we are injecting new inventory into new customers and penetrated customers. So generally speaking, we expect in a growth environment, we expect to use working capital. Now last year, in the first quarter, our use of working capital was quite larger than it was this year in the first quarter. So we were in the midst of a lot of system integration activity, a lot of G&K integration activity, and so we had some disruption in the accounts receivable environment. We feel really good about where we are today. And so you've seen a little bit of a less of a usage there, from an inventory perspective last year and an in-service inventory last year. When we make an acquisition like G&K, there are points in time at which we are going through inventory a little bit more quickly because we're transitioning out of legacy G&K inventory into Cintas types of inventory. Now that didn't happen all at once in the first quarter last year, but it certainly picked up. It continues today but certainly at a lesser pace. And so that's - there was a little bit disruption last year in the first quarter, a little bit more of a steady state this year in the first quarter, but we would expect continued use as long as we can continue to grow. Seth, I don't have the balance of last year right in front of me, but I would - generally speaking, yes. We wouldn't expect any - anything of a disruptive nature in those areas. That certainly is our - yeah that certainly is our expectation. From a self-insurance standpoint, we've had quarters in the past where we'll see one time claims pop up and it results in a little bit of a higher insurance, medical expense than normal. Those may continue to happen. But generally speaking, we expect to see some nice leverage in SG&A, particularly from the G&A side of things. Paul mentioned that labor, G&A labor was down a little bit and we are very pleased with that. So we'll have disruptions from quarter-to-quarter. Generally speaking, we do expect leverage, no doubt. Yes, George, not a lot of difference from a normal quarter from the standpoint of new business continues to be strong, productivity from our reps was really good. And within that new business, set was a good no programmer performance. So new business continues to lead the growth effort. From adds, stops nothing to call out really. But, as I mentioned earlier, pricing in the quarter did help similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. So a little bit, certainly year-over-year help in that regard as well. So real nice sales productivity, little bit of pricing help, real nice execution from our partners. Yes. So from a material costing standpoint, we haven't seen a lot of change right now. It seems like the trade and tariff conversation is more conversation than impact at this point, but it's still creating a lot of noise and uncertainty for our customers and us to a certain extent. But I haven't seen much of an impact. Keep in mind from a material perspective, most of our material costs get amortized over some period of time, whether it's the life of a garment or the life of a mat, and that amortization period really helps. It's a bit of a natural hedging that helps us smooth those kind of cost out. But I would say no costs to call out from that regard. Labor, we've talked over the course of the last year, we've seen it some pressure in pockets, and didn't see anything new or different in this quarter. Yes, I would say in the quarter it was about a $0.06 impact, for the year, probably about an $0.08 impact. And look, the - so much of that impact that we speak of is kind of out of our control. Well you've heard us talk about the equity piece of that and that's what kind of played out - that played the role in the first quarter here. Yes, Andrew. It's - we're about 75% of the way complete now. And so we're still on track to finish that implementation by the end of the fiscal year. Yes. During the quarter, we - well, we have $263 million left on the authorization. We bought 837,000 shares for just under $200 million. Keep in mind that all of that purchasing was done prior to our July call. So it was - it did not have an impact on with the guidance that we gave you today. Well, you're right. We've talked a little bit about pressures here and there in pockets particularly in that production and plant environment. And I would say, we didn't see much of a change. It remains a competitive environment and we got to do - the best thing we can do is, is keep our turnover - our partner turnover as low as possible. And we've been pretty successful at that. So I know, not much of a change in this first quarter compared to what we've seen over the course of the last year. Well, Shlomo, G&K had about 20% union workforce when we acquired them. A union environment, a different culture, it certainly creates a different type of environment to operating environment and those kind of things can tend to make synergy capture a little bit more challenging. And so at the end of the day, would we evaluate something with a heavy union component? You know that's a value consideration more than anything else. And we'd have to take a good hard look at it, because it does complicate the synergy capture opportunity. But there is - that's a part of the conversation around value and consideration. Correct. Well, Shlomo, we've always looked at that buyback as we've executed as an opportunistic program. And if you go back over the course of the last 10 years, we are not consistent from quarter-to-quarter and that's by design. We kind of look at a bunch of different things. We look at the performance of the business, the investment needs of the business. We look at M&A opportunities on the horizon. We look at things like upcoming dividends and we have a consistent history of not being consistent in the way that we execute on that buyback program. And I'm not sure I look into anything more than that. Well, we had a real nice gross margin quarter with the gross margin being up 110 basis points. And so we're with that growth, we are continuing to invest in routes and in capacity. But really you're right Shlomo, from an investment standpoint, we did continue to invest in the SG&A space. And so we do see a little bit of an elevated SG&A number compared to last year. Keep in mind, they are also affected by the medical. And that was about an 80 basis point headwind. But you're right, we are continuing to invest in that business. We do really like it. Yes Shlomo, it's 65 in each quarter of this fiscal year. And then, let's see, compared to '19. So we had 66 in Q1 last year, then 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. So from a market by market - from an end market perspective, and nothing to call out of any significance. You've heard us talk a little bit about the pricing environment over the years. When businesses in the rental business are performing well, when they are growing they have limited capacity and it generally tends to add a little bit of more readableness to the pricing environment, and so we do see a little bit of that going on. We also I think do a pretty good job of articulating to our customers, why at times pricing can be appropriate. And so I think that execution has been pretty good as well. So combination of the health of the marketplace, our ability to articulate I think that has combined to a nice environment. We do - we are seeing some cross-sell opportunities and benefits like we have over the course of the last year. And, but I would say generally speaking and we'd rather not call out that specific item, but generally speaking, we're always looking and investing for ancillary products ways that we can add some value for our customers. And so in this case, it was a nice benefit. Sometimes those happen in a particular quarter and didn't happen last year, they can be lumpy in terms of when the roll-outs occur, but we like where we are in terms of our ability to create those ancillary products within our businesses. That's what - we've talked many times about the umbrellas of image safety, cleanliness and compliance and when we think broadly like that with our customers, sometimes, we're able to come up with some pretty nice and unique ideas and we've been - we've had some success over the course of the last year, and that would go for legacy G&K customers as well as into legacy Cintas customers. We've had some nice success. Yes, right. No, there was nothing to call out in that regard during the quarter. We are in an interesting time as I was mentioning earlier Andrew, where we've injected a decent amount of new Cintas product into legacy G&K customers, and that can create some rippling and we're going to see a little bit of that as we move forward, but less of it today than a year ago I would say. As we move forward, we're going to continue to sell, hopefully a lot of new business, and so we'll continue to inject at pretty good rates. But again, I would say nothing to call out. Our managers are managing the inventory and the in-service pretty well. We certainly would like to think so, I mean, when we look at the inventory, Andrew, our people understand the features and the functionality of the inventory in the garments that we have. And they are trained to point those features and functions out to our customers. So as long as we are doing our job and introducing those garments and introducing those prominent features and functions of them, I'm expecting that the customers certainly notice. Well. Thank you for joining us tonight. We will issue our second quarter financial results in December and we look forward to speaking you - speaking with you again at that time. Good night."

            "name": "Paul Adler",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal '19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points, in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. And we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19. Each quarter of fiscal '20 will contain 65 workdays. In comparison to fiscal '19, our upcoming Q2 of fiscal '20 will have the same number of days. Q3 will have one additional day, and Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results. We have two reportable operating segments Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consist of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 5.8%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and differences in the number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 7.5%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 47.2% for the first quarter compared to 45.7% than last year's first quarter, an improvement of 150 basis points. Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.20% compared to 2.45% in the prior year quarter. The gross margin expansion was driven in large part by the strong revenue increase covering certain fixed production and service department costs. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $172.1 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 13.8%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 49.0% in the first quarter compared to 47.9% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. First Aid segment gross margins continue to increase with stop - with a strong top line growth. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All Other revenue was $184.5 million, an increase of 8.8%. The organic growth rate was 9.7%. The Fire business organic growth rate came in at 12.5%. Uniform Direct Sale business had a good quarter too, posting an organic growth rate of 5.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.8% for the first quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 42.9% for last year's first quarter. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.0% in the first quarter of fiscal '20, and 29.7% in the first quarter of '19. Lower labor expense as a percent of revenue was offset by increases in other expenses, particularly an 80 basis point increase in medical expense. We are self-insured and therefore subject to some volatility in medical expense from quarter-to-quarter. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was 10.1%. Stock based compensation positively impacted the tax rate. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period to period, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense. Please note three new line items on our balance sheet, resulting in an increase in assets and liabilities by about $165 million. These relate to our adoption in the quarter of the Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, entitled Leases. The adoption does not have a material impact on net income or cash flow. Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $102.1 million. Operating cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal '20 increased about 70% from the amount of operating cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal '19, and benefited from strong earnings growth, and improvements in working capital. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $64.7 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows; $53.0 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8.1 million in the First Aid and Safety, and $3.6 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '20 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $310 million. As of August 31, total debt was $2,876.9 billion. $2,538.1 billion was fixed interest rate debt, and $338.8 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan and commercial paper. At August 31, our leverage of 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA was slightly lower than our target of 2x. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Yes, sure, Manav. So let's start like with First Aid. We mentioned the organic growth at 13.8%. That's a business that has executed very well. We typically expect organic growth to be in high single digits, maybe 10% is what we've talked about for that business. So they came in a little bit stronger. Of course, there is a lot of blocking and tackling a lot of variables that go into the performance in the quarter. But of note, we did have a new item that we rolled out in the quarter. A new item in the cabinet and it's kind of like a - kind of like a rollout of a direct sale program, for example in Uniform Direct Sale business where you're putting that into the cabinets, you get a lot of revenue, and then you're counting on some smaller trail of that revenue going on in the lapping quarter. So a little bit of a boost because of that new product rollouts, and so outlook for First Aid is going to be continuing to have a great year, but probably the latter quarters more in the high single digits where we historically have been. Fire. That business, impressive organic growth rate of 12.5%. Again a lot of pieces to that with execution of the sales force and great quality service. But they did have a little bit of an easier comp, Manav. I think their growth rates a year ago was about 8%, so little bit higher than 8%. So I think some of the 12.5% was a little bit of that easier comp. And in that business, the Fire business, there is really two types of revenue streams. There is a more reoccurring revenue stream that we call test and inspection, testing and inspecting fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems, et cetera. It tends to repeat more often. But we also have another revenue stream when things break, when alarms don't work, you have to perform repair and maintenance. And we had some national account repair and maintenance type revenue in the first quarter that was a little bit larger than we expected, and we don't expect that to repeat. So I think the 12.5% was a little bit higher than we typically expect. And then finally kind of rounding out the other business units. You'll note - well you can't - I mean we might have mentioned in the prepared remarks that the Direct Sale business had a good growth rate of 5.8%. A year ago, the growth rate was rather weak, in fact it actually had some shrinkage of about 1.8%. So that's a business that I think benefited from that easier comp in the first quarter. And as we've talked about previously in our prepared remarks that Direct Sale business is typically more of a 3% grower, long-term. Gary, it's Paul. I think that even in our 10-K, we actually have to break - I think the revenue recognition adoption of that FASB caused us to provide more detail. So you can take a look at the last 10-K and you'll see it. But my recollection is - and doing the math the last time that Fire is kind of like about 55% of the mix at this point in time, 45% then is the Direct sale business. And then to your point, we've tried to add some color that the Fire business is high single digits, 10% organic, whereas that Direct sale business is typically around 3%. Fire - the Fire business had a very good quarter. It improved gross margins and improved operating margins. But to your point, because of the fact that we lump those together for the accounting guidance, and we call it All Other, it blends this particular quarter to a little bit of a shrink in the gross margin by I think 10 basis points that was. But if that's more due to the - the mix shift and the fact that the direct sale business grew 5.8% and it shifts that mix and could cause that to move. But if you parse those two businesses out, Fire business actually improved their margins as I said. Yes, that's reasonable, Seth, but it's just that Q1 that is so - such an outlier because of the stock option exercises. So I think that's good for modeling for the remainder of the year."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Adler: Thank you, Nick. And thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas\u2019 Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors; Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2021. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Hansen.\nMike Hansen: Thanks, Paul. Our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue was $1.84 billion compared to $1.62 billion in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 13.3%. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays was 11.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 13.7%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment declined 6.8%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $859.1 million compared to $707.8 million in last year's fourth quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 310 basis points to 46.8% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 43.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percent of revenue to 27.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 30.9% last year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 of $356.4 million increased 71.8%. Operating margin increased 660 basis points to 19.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19 including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%, all of these items were recorded in last year's selling and administrative expenses. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was 19.4% compared to 20.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the impact of stock compensation. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $267.7 million, an increase of 85.2%. EPS was $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.5 times debt-to-EBITDA at May 31st, 2021. On June 1st, 2021, $250 million of debt bearing an interest rate of 4.3% matured and was repaid with cash on hand. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. During the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and our first quarter of fiscal '22 to date, we purchased $979 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. On June 15th, 2021, Cintas paid shareholders $79.2 million in quarterly dividends. For the fiscal year ended May 31st, 2021, revenue was $7.12 billion compared to $7.09 billion for fiscal '20. EPS for fiscal '21 were $10.24 compared to $8.11 for last fiscal year. Revenue and adjusted EPS have grown 50 of the past 52 years. Fiscal '21 free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $1.22 billion, an increase of 14.7% compared to last year. For our fiscal '22, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.35 to $10.75. Please note the following regarding our guidance. Our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19.5% to 20.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% in fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 EPS guidance by about $0.85 and EPS growth by about 800 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. We remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a steadily improving economy, absent any economic or pandemic related setbacks. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there are no workday differences when comparing fiscal '22 to '21. Both fiscal years contained 66 days in the first quarter, 65 in the second, 64 in the third and 66 in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn the call to Paul for commentary on the performance of each of our businesses.\nPaul Adler: Thanks, Mike. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion compared to $1.27 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 410 basis points to 47.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter, driven in large part by lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. While some inflationary pressures increased certain costs, these were more than offset by increased revenue from businesses re-opening or increasing capacity as COVID-19 case counts fell and restrictions on businesses were reduced. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $186.9 million compared to $196.3 million last year. First Aid fourth quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's fourth quarter, in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment sales surged. Also, the first aid Cabinet Service business was not impacted until late in last year's fourth quarter when business restrictions became widespread. As a result, the division posted a 21.9% organic revenue growth rate in last year's fourth quarter. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 46.1% last year. The difference in gross margins is due to revenue mix. As we guided last quarter, less personal protective equipment was sold in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. However, as a percentage of total division revenue, personal protective equipment revenue was still a significant percentage, while profitable personal protective equipment revenue has lower gross margins than the first aid cabinet servicing business. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially as the cabinet servicing business continues to grow and gets closer to the pre-COVID percent of total division revenue. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $181.9 million compared to $152.3 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue increased 22.4%. Gross margin improved 70 basis points. Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue growth rate was 6.2%, and gross margin increased 280 basis points. I'll now turn the call over to Todd for our final prepared remarks.\nTodd Schneider: Thanks, Paul. We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results that conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following. We help keep our customers' place of business clean, safe and Ready for the Workday by providing essential products and services. We procured hard to find and potentially life saving items such as face masks and gloves, provided hygienically clean health care scrubs and isolation gowns and developed services, including hand sanitizer dispensing, sanitizing spray services and disinfecting wipes. Our Net Promoter Scores reached an all-time high because we consistently delivered for our customers by providing needed products and services and being flexible with service agreement terms during the pandemic. We were again named to the prestigious Fortune 500, climbing 31 spots to rank at number 410 on the 2021 list. It's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We allocated capital to improve shareholder return. We paid down debt, reducing interest expense. We increased the annual dividend 10.2% and changed from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend to return cash to shareholders more timely. We've increased the dividend 37 consecutive years. Also in fiscal 2021 and up until today, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of Cintas stock for a total of $979 million. As part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our inaugural environmental, social and governance, or ESG report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and supporting the communities where we do business. And in addition to these many accomplishments and despite the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we grew our fiscal year revenue and adjusted EPS. I can't thank our employee partners enough, and I'm so proud of their truly impressive achievements. The Cintas story is one of growth. We have grown revenue and adjusted EPS in 50 of the past 52 years. The only exceptions were the Great Recession years. Our successful long-term financial formula is organic revenue growth in the mid to high single digits, double-digit earnings per share growth, significant cash generation, improved deployment of excess cash to further generate strong shareholder returns. Our prospects for continued growth are great and a result in part from a strong value proposition and a vast total addressable market. We have a product or service to help nearly every business get Ready for the Workday. Examples include, scrubber rental to hospitals and dentists, hygiene supplies and services to professional services firms, floor care services, including walk-off mats and mops to retailers, first aid products to hotel and restaurant kitchens for cuts and burns, fire protection services to facilities managers and universities, and personal protective equipment to city maintenance and sanitation departments. The renting of health care scrubs and isolation gowns is indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Plus, we are so much more than a uniform company. More than half of our revenue is from facility services, including hygiene, floor care items such as walk-off mats and dust mops, cleaning tools like microfiber mops and towels, first aid cabinet services, personal protective equipment, and fire protection services, including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms. Our total addressable market is the 15 to 20 million businesses we don't currently service. Every business, goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of non-core activities. Significant opportunities for new revenues continue to exist because of the need of businesses to instil confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. The new services we launched, including hand sanitizer stand dispenser service and sanitizing spray service, have a long runway. Cintas consistently invest in technology to support growth. Our recent implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system provides benefits in three main areas. One is operational efficiencies. Our route drivers utilize personal route computers, which are similar to a cell phone, to access data and process transactions real time. Also, SAP enabled us to have visibility to laundered plant stock room [ph] inventories across our operations, helping improve profitability via the sharing and reuse of revenue producing assets. And the technology helps us improve working capital, be it tighter management of supply chain inventory. A second benefit is data analytics and enhanced business reporting. These result from having the order to cash cycle all in one system. SAP enables us to analyze, process and extract information from extremely large data sets, helping us target penetration, cross selling and pricing opportunities. And the third competitive advantage is improved customer service. Through SAP, our customers can pay bills and communicate with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We expect the ease of doing business will help us improve customer retention. Also, customers can order products and services via SAP, resulting in improved turnaround time and faster realization of product and service revenue. I want to say a few more words regarding ESG. From the start of our company in the Great Depression, the Cintas business model was wholly based on sustainable practices, wash and reuse. We have a great corporate responsibility story to tell. We will continue to expand our ESG reporting and are excited about issuing our next report this year. And finally, I'd like to say thank you on behalf of all Cintas employee partners to Scott Farmer for his 18 years of service as Chief Executive Officer. Under Scott's leadership, the company's revenue grew from $2.69 billion in 2003 to $7.12 billion in fiscal 2021. Scott successfully led Cintas through years filled with challenges, changes and opportunities, including the Great Recession, our largest acquisition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the integration of SAP technology across the organization. We thank Scott for his service to the company as CEO, and we are grateful that he remains as Executive Chairman.\nScott Farmer: Thank you, Todd. And I'd like to take this moment to thank all of my Cintas partners across the company. I'm proud of our many collective accomplishments, including the innovative products and services that we provide our customers, as well as the tremendous dedication of our employee partners without whom we wouldn't be successful. Our company is in a position of financial strength with the strongest and most experienced management team that we've ever had executing a proven strategy that has allowed our continued success even through the recent pandemic. It's been a true honor and privilege for me to have led this company as CEO for the last 18 years. And I'm as excited about our future as I've ever been, and I look forward to watching this leadership team steer us to continued success in the future.\nPaul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Wittmann with R.W. Baird. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Wittmann: Great. And thanks for taking my question. Scott, congratulations on a great run. It's been a pleasure, and we look forward to still having you associated maybe when we come to Cincinnati next time.\nScott Farmer: You bet. Thank you.\nAndrew Wittmann: Yeah. So I guess getting on to business here a little bit, and maybe this is for Mike. There is been a lot of focus on inflationary factors. And what I heard here on your prepared remarks and in your release was that it sounds like you are getting good operating leverage. But I was just hoping you could drill in and talk about some of the key factors you've talked about in the past. Certainly, labor is one that's come up a lot broadly across the street. You've talked about some other things like health care, travel. And others are mentioning merchandise costs. I was just wondering if you could talk about some of those key buckets. And talk about the offsets that you have baked into guidance because it looks like your margin guidance is flat to up slightly. And so I was just kind of hoping you could talk about some of the moving pieces inside of that as to why you feel like you can offset some of these headwinds that might be creeping in?\nMike Hansen: Sure. I'll begin, and certainly, Todd can jump in. But as it relates to guidance, you are right, Andrew. The implied margins would be at the low end of the guidance flattish to at the high end up around 70 basis points, so a pretty good range. And you know, you've heard us talk a lot about we've made some really great progress. We made some difficult decisions through this pandemic, and it'd be a shame to go backwards in this. And this guidance is suggesting that we don't intend to. And so how do we think about this inflation? Certainly, labor, as you mentioned, Andrew, is a big component of our cost structure. And the really good news for us is we've been working on the labor rates for some time, so this isn't something that is catching us by surprise. And over the last several years, we've been increasing the labor rates. And so certainly, the labor environment is a difficult one from the standpoint of the supply of people hiring has been a little bit more difficult. But we don't expect that the increasing wages around us is really going to be a significant issue. We've been working on that for years and don't expect that to really be that difficult for us as we move into the future.\nScott Farmer: And I would add that, that includes last fiscal year. We raised the wage rates of all of our hourly people in our distribution centers, offices, production, all of our service, frontline service personnel. So we don't have a big catch up as a result of that. I know there are other businesses out there that froze wages in the pandemic. And because it was a year, they might have a catch up to make, and we don't have that. So you know, I'm happy to say that. But I don't think that so far we've seen issues where the labor rates are going to cause us significant problems. But we're more concerned about what happens to our customers as a result of this. And so we'll be watching that very closely.\nTodd Schneider: Andrew, this is Todd. It's a great question. We're in a good staffing position. We like where we are there. We like the fact that we've been addressing this subject over the course of a number of years. And as Scott pointed out appropriately, even in the peak of the pandemic last year, we were committed to staying the course and do the right things and taking care of our hourly partners to - because we knew that we could see things coming, right, and we're committed to it. So that's important to us. Certainly, other input costs are cost of goods. And our supply chain team is working harder than ever, and they are doing a great job in managing through that process to get us the goods that we need to make sure we're servicing our customers, which are doing a great job at, and to manage our cost structure from that standpoint. But we like the spot we're in, and we anticipate getting, hopefully some leverage on the additional revenue that we bring in. We've done such a great job and took such a big jump forward from fiscal '20 to fiscal '21 that as Mike stated, it will be a shame to go backwards, and we're focused on going forward.\nMike Hansen: And Andrew, maybe I'll add a couple of other items. You saw that energy was 30 basis points higher in our fourth quarter than our third quarter, about 40 basis points year-over-year. We've built that kind of increase into our guidance. And certainly, there is room within our guidance for larger increases than that, but something that we'll keep our eye on. We are - we constantly are working on improving efficiencies, productivity levels, routing, and those things will all have positive impacts. From a material cost standpoint, you know, the good news is many of our rental items are amortized. So when we see increases in costs, they generally tend to take a long time to make it to our P&L, and they must - they have to last for a while so that they bleed in over time. And so, you know, obviously, we've got a great global supply chain Todd talked about, and they adapt. And so when we see inflationary pressures, we look for opportunities to adapt to that new environment. And I think, over the course of the last year, we've talked a lot about our supply chain. They've done a great job, and we anticipate that they will continue to do a very good job. Now having said that, you know, there are a lot of challenges in the supply chain and in hiring that we've talked about. And we're not immune to inflationary pressures. They are all built into our guidance. But the other thing is, we haven't increased our pricing for 2 years, right? And - but we certainly believe that, that is an opportunity for us. As we move into this new fiscal year, we have selectively started to do that in some areas. Pricing is local for us. It's customer by customer decision, and where we believe it makes sense, we will do that. And so that is certainly something that is available to us when we believe that the cost pressure is warranted. Again, all of that is built into our guidance, which assumes not just keeping the great leap forward that we made in fiscal '21, but even continuing to improve upon.\nAndrew Wittmann: That's really helpful. Thank you. I just - my one follow-up, is just trying to get a sense of the re-opening benefits that you are getting or expecting at a sequential basis. How much is left after the May quarter and into June? Is there still businesses that are closed for you or substantially closed where the revenues are so de minimis that they might as well be considered closed? Or on a sequential basis, are you starting to feel like things are fairly normal here, June, July time period? Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: So Andrew, Mike talked about pricing being a local subject, re-opening is a local subject as well. But for the most part, most businesses are back. Certainly, Canada has been a little slower to come back because of vaccination rates and government impacts there. But nevertheless, in general, most businesses are back. Now are they back at the levels that we think they will be in the future? No, and we're committed to helping them with our valuable products and services to help them be prepared as their employees come back and their customers come back, so that they can be - they can compete in the marketplace. So hopefully, that helps.\nScott Farmer: Yeah. I would add, this is Scott. I would add that we think that Canada will be in the position that the US is sometime the end of the summer with re-openings, but they're on a steady pace heading in that direction. The biggest issue that we have is that businesses are open, but there are, what, about 7 million fewer people employed right now than they were pre-pandemic. And so there's a lot of room there. And I think as federal unemployment benefits subside in, what September, we hope to see that our customers that are open will be able to get themselves back to full staffing, and that will obviously benefit our business.\nOperator: Thank you. Moving on to our next question, we'll go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning, guys. So I was just hoping you could help us with the kind of cadence of organic growth by segment. There is still obviously a lot of uncertainty potentially out there, so thank you for giving full year guidance. But I was just hoping if there is anything to call out in terms of modeling you know, the growth rates of the segments?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Manav. this is Todd. So I think you've seen through our guidance, we expect a range of 5.8 to 7.2 from a growth rate. When you think about - obviously, the rental division is our, by far, our largest division, so that will be in that range. But we expect that all of our businesses, meaning the other businesses, Fire, First Aid and our Direct Sale business, will all be high single digit growth businesses in this fiscal year. So we feel very positive about all of them, and I look forward to growth in each of those businesses.\nMike Hansen: Yeah. I think we might see a little bit of bumpiness in the First Aid business. You saw that their revenue was a little bit lower. Growth wise they had a decline in the fourth quarter. They had such a strong year last year, particularly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We may see a little bit of bumpiness through the year, but it's a great business. It's improving. We are seeing the recurring business and the mix start to turn back to where we like it. And so that's just throughout the year, maybe a little bit of a different performance than we're used to seeing from a steadiness perspective.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. That makes sense. And then if I can just ask you know, around capital allocation, I mean the buyback was a pretty big number, the $900 plus million that you talked about. Can you just help us understand that in the context of the M&A pipeline and what we should expect going forward?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. So our commitment is still number one priority is to invest back into our business, to grow the number of customers we have and grow those customers and invest in our infrastructure. Our second one is to invest in M&A. And we are very focused on M&A, active in that area and it's a big push for us. And then third, if there is - consistent with what our approach has been in the past, if there is capital that is in excess of that, then we'll return it back to the shareholders in the form of increasing dividend and repurchase of the stock as appropriate.\nPaul Adler: Yeah, Manav, this is Paul. And I was just wanted to add that, we're so fortunate to have such a strong balance sheet, the cash flow is so strong. We did that buyback, and our leverage is 1.5 times, as we mentioned in the script. So fortunate to be in a position where you know, what we do with the dividend and the buyback doesn't preclude us from M&A or any other activities because of the strength of the balance sheet.\nManav Patnaik: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. When you frame fiscal '22 revenue growth, could you just talk about some verticals here, which verticals do you think will be above the average growth of the guide? And which verticals might take longer to rebound or maybe they are just kind of slower growth verticals?\nTodd Schneider: So Andrew, this is Todd. As we look at the business, certainly, the hospitality business is - you read about it in the papers, right? You see - you hear about bookings, whether it's airlines or hotels, et cetera. That is a vertical that we think will be quite positive this year. The health care vertical is going to continue to be strong for us. Hospitals are catching up on voluntary type of procedures, which is helping that. And we have a very attractive value proposition in both of those areas as well. Education, government are both - we expect to be quite strong for us. There was a the mix of business, I think, you will see will be different in those areas, less PPE and more focused on more of a traditional type of approach that we've had in the past. But those key verticals are all positioned well. And if you think of them all, they are all positioned quite well, hospitality probably the best.\nAndrew Steinerman: Are there any slower growth verticals or really it's a rising tide here?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. I would say I don't - none come to mind where I would say, yes, a slower type of growth. It's just - we're kind of a rising tide is the best way to put it.\nAndrew Steinerman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nRyan Gunning: Hey, good morning. It's actually Ryan Gunning filling in for Hamzah. My first question, just around the Fire Protection business. And if you could just talk about the competitive dynamics there and any opportunity for larger scale M&A in that business kind of similar to what you did with ZEE Medical and the First Aid side?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Ryan. This is Todd. We like our position in the Fire business and really like the Fire business. There, we understand the - how to go to market and how to make attractive margins in that business. And we're investing, we're investing in M&A, we're investing in infrastructure to make sure that we're able to service all of our customers. And we have a national offering in that business, some via sub-contracting. But nevertheless, a very attractive national approach, and we're positioned well. How we - our culture, our infrastructure, how we execute puts us in a good spot. And there's good momentum in that business. There was - you think about it, right? It's all - legally, you have to have that - those products and those services. But nevertheless, there was some pent up demand in it from repairs, right. So if you think about someone comes through and looks at your fire equipment, and there are some items that need to be repaired. During the pandemic, people are more so anxious to spend money on those types of subjects and - but as we're coming out of it, we're busy, we're busy in that area for many reasons, one of which is some pent up demand on repair, which is great business for us.\nRyan Gunning: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then switching over, could you provide any kind of visibility on like how much of your sales you consider today as pandemic, like non-recurring versus recurring and how you kind of define that?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, great question. So when you think about, let's call it, PPE items that were really pandemic related, they are still at levels elevated from pre-pandemic, but we do not expect them to repeat at the levels that they were in fiscal '21. So if you think about our guidance, we think we would be - with the PPE that doesn't repeat, if it has - if it does repeat, then we would be in the, you know, on the high end, above 8% from an internal growth rate. So think about it that way about how much is - will not be repeating, that we don't expect to repeat, which kind of demonstrates the mix of business is going to be back closer - much closer to traditional. And there is some real good momentum there to get to the growth rates that we've guided towards.\nRyan Gunning: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. In the Uniform Rental segment, can you talk a bit about sales rep productivity trends and how the pipeline is performing, especially moving through the quarter and entering fiscal 2022?\nTodd Schneider: George, I'm glad you asked about that. I have been so impressed by our sales organization, the creativity, the flexibility, the urgency, the intensity about which way they go about their jobs and how they have adapted to a crazy environment. And we try to work very hard to position them with great products and services so that people very much want to take their calls. And so we like where that's heading. The mix of business is obviously changing, but it's getting back to much more traditional, George. But there is a strong audience for the - our sales partners and in whom they are calling on, partly because there were some items that you - when people were going through the pandemic, they said, hey, I can't make a decision on uniforms right now, but I need some critical products to help my business run. We provided those critical products and services and its positioned us, now that it's closer to businesses getting back to normal, where we say, okay, now I'm ready to talk about those types of items. So all that is positive for us. You know, as we went through it, folks didn't realize that we had all the products and services that we do. So that opens some doors, and we're continuing to operate in those doors to help improve our business.\nGeorge Tong: That's very helpful. And then switching gears to health care and hygiene. Those are very strong categories over the past year. Can you describe what kind of performance you're expecting structurally from those health care and hygiene categories, not just in fiscal 2022, but really looking forward? And then diving into PPE, you talked a little bit about normalization there in First Aid mix going back to pre-COVID levels over time, which has higher margins. Just talk a little bit about that evolving mix as well and the implications for growth and profitability?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, George, I'll start and Mike, Scott, Paul, if they want to jump in. We've spoken in the past about hygiene, cleanliness, all those subjects that the pandemic has done for those subjects what 9/11 did to security 20 years ago. And so what we're seeing is there's a greater focus on the health of employees, health of patients, health of guests, students, and hygiene is a big part of that. So we see that as something that will be elevated into the future, and we think that's good for society, that's good for our business and good certainly for all those individuals. So we think that's going to be something that's elevated, hopefully, in perpetuity. As far as PPE normalization, there is - there was a breakneck pace to get PPE last year because folks couldn't keep their doors open in certain cases couldn't work. So there was some real peaks last year. That is certainly less. We expect this year the variants, the delta variant, I think, brings a bit of a wildcard into that, which we're not going to try to predict. But nevertheless, as you see, as we go throughout the year, you will see much more normalization. You'll see more people using our traditional cabinets, First Aid products, hands and cabinets as we say, and PPE will be more moderate. Now just keep in mind, we've always been in the PPE business. We've always provided these products and services, it's just they were elevated. We will continue to offer them. But as more people get back to work in offices and machine shops, in government and education, there will be more people that will be consuming, from a first aid standpoint, our traditional types of bandages and tablets, et cetera. So hopefully, that gives you a little color.\nPaul Adler: And George, this is Paul. I just want to tell, you mentioned First Aid specifically too, so I just want to make sure we provided enough clarity there. That business, as Mike said, alluded to, it's in a transition period where, to Todd's point, so much PPE was provided. We seized the opportunity to come through for our customers and provide thermometers and masks and visors, et cetera. So it's an outsized percent of the revenue. That will transition, as we've been talking about the last couple of quarters. What I want to make sure everybody understands is that First Aid business is getting back to that more re-occurring revenue stream with that Cabinet Service business, which we are very excited about. And to think about a 9% or high single digit type of a growth rate for First Aid in fiscal '22, that's coming off a huge growth rate with a lot of PPE. So still a strong performance. And what I want to make sure people don't miss is that, in order to drive a high single digit growth rate in '22, with PPE declining, that Cabinet Service business is growing very strongly. And what that will do then is improve the margins going forward for the First Aid business in fiscal '22. And we probably won't get back all the way to pre-COVID levels in terms of margins in First Aid because, just like many of our businesses, it's a lot of small transactions. There's some momentum that has to build. But definitely, the margins will continue to improve through the year as we get back to servicing those cabinets.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. I know you talked about the margin guidance earlier in the call and addressed the inflation impacts. But I wanted to see if you could provide maybe some additional detail around which business lines you're expecting to see the most strength from a margin perspective?\nMike Hansen: Well, Toni, I would say, you know, all of our - we expect all of our businesses to perform very, very well. And in order for us to be able to guide in the way that we did from about flattish to up 70 basis points, we're going to need good performance out of all of our businesses. And that translates into very good incremental margins, especially in our Rental business. It's certainly, as Paul just described, it means that we're going to see some nice improvement in our First Aid margins as we see a bit of a mix shift. We expect continued good performance in our Fire business, as I think we mentioned 22% organic growth in the fourth quarter. We've got some great momentum, and we'll get some nice leverage as we move into the year. And then certainly, our Direct Sale business, those margins I would expect, from a percentage standpoint to really increase nicely, as we see those - see the revenue start to come back, that will allow us to get a little bit more efficient and certainly be able to leverage our infrastructure in that business. So we're looking for margin, good margin performance in all of our businesses all contributing to that guidance range, margin improvement and all contributing to a real healthy 20% to 30% incremental margins.\nTodd Schneider: Toni, the - obviously, we're guiding towards all of our businesses growing, incremental margins 20% to 30%. But when you think about it, obviously, the mix is going to change in all those businesses. And each of them sold, with the exception of Fire, there was some PPE. And so there's - we'll get back to more traditional type of mix. And that and the leverage on the additional revenue is going to help us.\nToni Kaplan: That's great. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the 15 million to 20 million businesses that you don't currently service. Could you just talk about the recent industry outsourcing trends? Has that - have you seen that accelerate or flatten? And how do you go about reaching out to those businesses? Is that an initiative, a big opportunity for you any more so than historically? Just how should we think about the opportunity?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Toni, the outsourcing trends continue, that has been positive. In addition, the focus on bringing manufacturing back to the United States and Canada, we think will be a positive, just that's obviously in the early innings. But both of those, we think, will be positives for our business. As far as reaching out, we have a significant investment in our infrastructure. And part of that infrastructure is in our route base, and part of that is in our sales organization. So that is a - that's a significant investment. You've probably also seen, I hope you've seen some of our investment in mass media that we're leveraging. Because we think it can pay dividends for that infrastructure. And there are one more thing we hear from customers and prospects, frankly, is, hey, I didn't know you did that. That is a product or a service that they didn't realize that we provided. So we're trying to leverage that and get the message out and to give a little air cover to our infrastructure.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nTim Mulrooney: Good morning, guys. I wanted to check in on the health care opportunity, which I know has gotten a lot of attention on recent calls. We haven't talked about it a lot yet today. You previously stated that I think that the vertical could expand from kind of 7% of sales today towards potentially 10% of sales over the next several years. But I know things are changing rapidly these days. So with another three months under your belt, I'm curious if those expectations have changed at all in either direction?\nTodd Schneider: Tim, this is Todd. I'll start. We don't see momentum slowing down in that area. Again, hospitals are getting a little bit back to more normal operations of how they run their business, and our value proposition resonates with them. We've talked often about the various products and services that we provide, scrubs being a big one, isolation gowns, but also cleaning products to help them provide a healthy environment. So there is a whole lot more focus on health and welfare now. Obviously, in the health care business, because of what they do for a living, there's always been a major focus on providing an environment that allowed for high patient satisfaction, that was not only in health, but also in image. So its - when you think about what they need, it's a great vertical for us and the products and services we provide. And there is a long runway there. We're providing products and services to help institutions that - I'd like to think you'd be impressed by the name of - the list of people we do business with. So who's who in that business. But nevertheless, we're not nearly as penetrated as where we can be, should be and will be. So we're very much in the early innings on that vertical still.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. Great. Thanks, Todd. And just switching gears, I apologize if you already addressed this. But how did energy costs impact the results this quarter? I don't know, maybe year-over-year sequentially or however you want to present it. But can you also talk about your expectation for energy cost that's built into your guidance, maybe for your fleet, but then also for your production plans? Thank you.\nMike Hansen: Tim, our total energy costs for the quarter were 2.1% of revenue. That's up 30 basis points from the third quarter and that's up 40 basis points from a year ago. So we did certainly see some increase within the quarter. Our expectation is that those will remain elevated during fiscal '22, up at those levels, maybe even a little bit higher. So that's what we've got incorporated. Most of that increase being price at the pump, so our gas and our service, our routes. So that's what we've got in the guidance.\nTim Mulrooney: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nGary Bisbee: Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess on revenue, first, I have one clarification and one question. I just wanted to clarify. So high single digit for First Aid, I heard that, and then I heard some discussion of the tough comps and I think the term bumpiness. Is high single digit the right number for the year, but maybe declines in the near term as you get through the toughest period of comps is not out of the question? Is that a fair statement on that business? And the question then on revenue, on the Rentals business, right, the long-term growth rate has been sort of in line with this guidance. You've got easy comps, you've had sequential improvement throughout last year. The fourth quarter had quite strong growth. I guess I wonder why you wouldn't be positioned to grow faster than the historical long-term trend given those factors in this year. Did the hygiene business within rentals have an outsized benefit from PPE that rolls off, and is that a drag? Or are there other factors beyond just your normal conservatism that might be weighing on that business? Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: So Gary, as far as the First Aid, yeah, think about it as high single digits for the year. As Mike stated, Q4 last year, Q1 - excuse me, Q4 of '20 was a huge growth rate for the First Aid business, as was Q1, so the comp from right now were really big. So as the year goes on, the PPE will - the comp will lessen. And as a result, our growth rates will be better in that business. So the bumpiness that Mike spoke about is simply the PPE comps in the early portions of this fiscal year versus last. As far as the Rental, yeah, as we mentioned in the past, there's PPE in that - in our results from last year in Rental as well. And again, just going back to our total guidance if the PPE would repeat, that we do not believe it will, this year, then you'd be into the - the number would start with an eight as far as internal growth. So how far into the eight? I really don't know. But nevertheless, we'd be picking up a heck of a lot of basis points in growth if that PPE repeated. So it's a headwind. We're proud that we provided the product to our customers. Our customers really valued it. It opened doors. Excuse the pun, but it kept their doors opened in many cases. And our Net Promoter Scores reflect it. So they were very appreciative that we were able to provide those products and services. If they need them again, we'll provide them. We just don't think that they'll be at the levels that they were in the past.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you. And then a quick follow up. In the past, Mike, I think you've provided the breakdown of the Rentals business revenue in the fourth quarter by the various sub-segments. I wonder if you'd be willing to do that again this year?\nPaul Adler: Yeah, Gary, it's Paul. And we do - yeah, Gary, we have that information for you, excuse me. And I would preface it by saying, first of all, what we provided typically is a Q4 sample, Q4 fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20. Obviously, there's a lot of noise in these figures, excuse me, in that you know, it's an unprecedented time. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter was the onset of the pandemic. So a lot of job losses, a lot of pandemic-driven demand, as Todd just said, for certain items of PPE. So I want to throw that out there first. But last year's fourth quarter, so fiscal '20 Q4, Uniform Rental was 50% of the segment mix. Dust, which is the walk-off mats, mops, that was 18% of the mix. Hygiene products, those are the soaps, the air fresheners, sanitizing dispensers, et cetera, that's 14% last year. Shop towels were 4%, linens 10 and the catalog business, which is more like the direct - small direct sales component of the Rental business products off of the route from the drivers, that was 4%. So, then this year's mix: uniform rental 48%; dust, 17%; hygiene at 17%; shop towels 4%; linens 9%; and catalog 5%. So again, obviously, COVID impacted results, not necessarily reflective of future performance. But with this breakout, you can obviously see how strongly hygiene performed. Typically, like in the Q4 of fiscal '20, that was mostly restroom type items, soaps and air fresheners, the paper. But in this Q4 '21, that hygiene percentage grew greater, driven by the sanitizer dispensers, the stands, the sanitizing sprays, et cetera. And then that catalog nudged up a little bit from 4% to 5%. And that's where a lot of the PPE in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business that we've talked about is recorded, the masks, gloves, those types of items.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. For my first one, I just wanted to follow up on the M&A comments earlier. It sounded like you have a very active pipeline that you're pursuing. I'm just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on what areas you may be pursuing and size of targets and how ripe things are. And then maybe what you're seeing with regard to multiples, good or bad, in the environment? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Scott, I'll say each of our businesses were acquisitive, but tuck-ins, certainly, some geographic expansion as well. So we're highly active. And there is folks that are at least answering phones and they are taking calls, and we'll see where that goes. Certainly, you wonder about changes to tax, potential changes to taxes, will that free things up? That will be interesting to see what happens with that. As far as the size and multiples, those types of things, you know, there's - everything's come from the very small to medium sized types, I won't comment on else, but it's - they're all active. And part of it is because multiples, if you look at it historically in the marketplace, they're pretty high. But we're quite active in that area because we look at it from a very long-term approach. And we know when we make those types of acquisitions that it positions us to grow those as well. Because of our broad offering of products and services that we bring to the table that in many cases, the folks that we're speaking to don't have that broadness, it allows for us to take a long-term approach and grow those businesses, whether it's just in that area of the business or cross selling it across each of our enterprise.\nScott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. Appreciate that. And then my follow-up is a bit of a two parter, but it ties together pretty well. In Todd's section in the press release, there was mention of investment in - continued investment in technology, a competitive advantage. Just hoping you could elaborate on that. And then the back part of the question is, CapEx was down a lot in the past fiscal year, almost half of what it was in fiscal year '19 and down a good bit from fiscal '20. Just curious where that goes this year and maybe tie it together with the tech question? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Great. I'll start with the tech question, and then Mike can handle the CapEx, if he prefers. Scott, we're investing heavily there because we see a need to - from a - whether it's productivity or from a competitive advantage. All areas of our business, we talked about leveraging SAP, leveraging the platforms that come along with that, they have customer benefits and operational benefits for us, and then obviously, the data that goes along with that. But that being said, we see some opportunities in automation that we've been investing in over the years. And we see opportunities to get efficiencies out of our fleet that we're investing in that we think can pay big dividends in that area. And so we're focused on doing such and making it easier to do business with Cintas. So - and we think, as you do that, that provides leverage for us. So leverage in the marketplace. So Mike, I'll let you handle the CapEx question.\nMike Hansen: Sure. From a CapEx perspective, clearly, the amounts were down in this past year because capacity needs just weren't the same as they had been in the previous years. We certainly kept up the CapEx for maintenance activities. But as we - there's a bit of a lag between when we need new capacity and when this revenue starts to - has started to come back. And we've seen some momentum, but there will be a little bit of a lag in the CapEx. Having said that, I expect we'll get back to historical levels by the end of the fiscal year. And that puts us probably in the $200 million to $250 million range for fiscal '22. But certainly, when we invest, we will certainly - when we need to invest, whether it's capacity, technology or otherwise, we will certainly do that.\nPaul Adler: Yeah. The great news is, regarding our investment in the ERP system, SAP, that we've talked about a lot. I mean, a lot of that investment spending in that - some of the major expense is behind us, and it took us a while to roll it out and get the entire network into SAP. We had the G&K acquisition that added more locations and kind of slowed down the time to complete it. Then we had the pandemic. And so the exciting thing is the additional investment will continue to be made throughout the business, of course, still in technology. But a lot of it's already paid for. And now it's perfecting the system, taking the toy, so to speak, out of the box and not just using it for the Xs and Os of running the business, but using it to meet that competitive advantage to give us the data analytics and the other advantages that we haven't had previously.\nScott Schneeberger: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is actually Bryan on for Kevin. Thanks for squeezing us here. Thanks for the commentary kind of around the color sort of on the re-opening and you don't expect - not all customers are quite back yet. So just drilling in that a little bit, how should we think about you know, sort of what percentage of clients are still inactive versus maybe kind of how that compares to out of businesses or attrition that we would see just to kind of frame that in. And any sort of commentary around how that shakes out geographically, either geographically or by vertical here in the US?\nTodd Schneider: So Bryan, I don't have a specific number for you, but just generally speaking, I'd say most businesses are back to some degree, not certainly back to full bore. We mentioned Canada specifically as an outlier, which we expect, let's just say, by August, September to be back much closer to normal. But one of the big issues is there are 7 million people less working today than there were a year ago or so. And of those 7 million people, I don't know what - how many of them are Cintas wearers or will be, but there's a percentage of. And we want those to - certainly see those folks get back to work. And whether they're wearing uniforms or utilizing our First Aid products and services, all that impacts us. So the - for the most part, businesses are back. They're certainly not anywhere near where we think they will be over time.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. And then last one here for us. You guys talked about continuing to expand on ESG reporting. And you know, certainly, what we've noticed is the ESG scores tend to focus on the internal operations. But we'd be curious if you could just touch on maybe how you guys help your customers achieve their ESG goals? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. Bryan, great question. Again, our heritage, what we do - and frankly, as I'm speaking of the Rental business, what our industry does, the impact that it has on saving customers water, energy, what we do to treat water instead of it going down into the sewer. Because those products, whether they're garments or towels or what have you, all that, they're going to be either purchased and thrown in the garbage or purchased and cleaned at home. And in both cases, we are helping substantially those folks helping the environment and helping to save landfill space, helping to fill or excuse me, save water, energy and the cleanliness of water as well. And I don't think we've told the story well enough in the past, because at our heritage, we are a wash and reuse business. And again, without our industry, there would be millions of more gallons and units of energy and et cetera that will be utilized because they're going to be either thrown to the landfill or laundered somehow. And we know that we are infinitely more efficient at laundering those products than they would be at home or in another type of setting.\nMike Hansen: You know, I might add also that when you think about our First Aid and Safety and Fire businesses, the purpose of those businesses are to keep our customers, employees safe and healthy. And so it's a little bit of a different ESG angle than what Todd was talking about. But from an employee perspective, our goals are to help our customers really achieve the safety and the health of their employees. So we're looking out for them from that S perspective of the ESG as well.\nOperator: All right. Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, at this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nPaul Adler: All right. Thanks, Nick. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter of fiscal '22 financial results in September. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul. Our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue was $1.84 billion compared to $1.62 billion in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 13.3%. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays was 11.5% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 13.7%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment declined 6.8%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $859.1 million compared to $707.8 million in last year's fourth quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 310 basis points to 46.8% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 43.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percent of revenue to 27.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 30.9% last year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 of $356.4 million increased 71.8%. Operating margin increased 660 basis points to 19.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 12.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating income was affected by many items caused by COVID-19 including additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, the fiscal '20 fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%, all of these items were recorded in last year's selling and administrative expenses. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was 19.4% compared to 20.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the impact of stock compensation. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 was $267.7 million, an increase of 85.2%. EPS was $2.47, an increase of 83% from last year's fourth quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.5 times debt-to-EBITDA at May 31st, 2021. On June 1st, 2021, $250 million of debt bearing an interest rate of 4.3% matured and was repaid with cash on hand. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. During the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and our first quarter of fiscal '22 to date, we purchased $979 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. On June 15th, 2021, Cintas paid shareholders $79.2 million in quarterly dividends. For the fiscal year ended May 31st, 2021, revenue was $7.12 billion compared to $7.09 billion for fiscal '20. EPS for fiscal '21 were $10.24 compared to $8.11 for last fiscal year. Revenue and adjusted EPS have grown 50 of the past 52 years. Fiscal '21 free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures was $1.22 billion, an increase of 14.7% compared to last year. For our fiscal '22, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $10.35 to $10.75. Please note the following regarding our guidance. Our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19.5% to 20.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% in fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 EPS guidance by about $0.85 and EPS growth by about 800 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. We remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a steadily improving economy, absent any economic or pandemic related setbacks. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there are no workday differences when comparing fiscal '22 to '21. Both fiscal years contained 66 days in the first quarter, 65 in the second, 64 in the third and 66 in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn the call to Paul for commentary on the performance of each of our businesses. Sure. I'll begin, and certainly, Todd can jump in. But as it relates to guidance, you are right, Andrew. The implied margins would be at the low end of the guidance flattish to at the high end up around 70 basis points, so a pretty good range. And you know, you've heard us talk a lot about we've made some really great progress. We made some difficult decisions through this pandemic, and it'd be a shame to go backwards in this. And this guidance is suggesting that we don't intend to. And so how do we think about this inflation? Certainly, labor, as you mentioned, Andrew, is a big component of our cost structure. And the really good news for us is we've been working on the labor rates for some time, so this isn't something that is catching us by surprise. And over the last several years, we've been increasing the labor rates. And so certainly, the labor environment is a difficult one from the standpoint of the supply of people hiring has been a little bit more difficult. But we don't expect that the increasing wages around us is really going to be a significant issue. We've been working on that for years and don't expect that to really be that difficult for us as we move into the future. And Andrew, maybe I'll add a couple of other items. You saw that energy was 30 basis points higher in our fourth quarter than our third quarter, about 40 basis points year-over-year. We've built that kind of increase into our guidance. And certainly, there is room within our guidance for larger increases than that, but something that we'll keep our eye on. We are - we constantly are working on improving efficiencies, productivity levels, routing, and those things will all have positive impacts. From a material cost standpoint, you know, the good news is many of our rental items are amortized. So when we see increases in costs, they generally tend to take a long time to make it to our P&L, and they must - they have to last for a while so that they bleed in over time. And so, you know, obviously, we've got a great global supply chain Todd talked about, and they adapt. And so when we see inflationary pressures, we look for opportunities to adapt to that new environment. And I think, over the course of the last year, we've talked a lot about our supply chain. They've done a great job, and we anticipate that they will continue to do a very good job. Now having said that, you know, there are a lot of challenges in the supply chain and in hiring that we've talked about. And we're not immune to inflationary pressures. They are all built into our guidance. But the other thing is, we haven't increased our pricing for 2 years, right? And - but we certainly believe that, that is an opportunity for us. As we move into this new fiscal year, we have selectively started to do that in some areas. Pricing is local for us. It's customer by customer decision, and where we believe it makes sense, we will do that. And so that is certainly something that is available to us when we believe that the cost pressure is warranted. Again, all of that is built into our guidance, which assumes not just keeping the great leap forward that we made in fiscal '21, but even continuing to improve upon. Yeah. I think we might see a little bit of bumpiness in the First Aid business. You saw that their revenue was a little bit lower. Growth wise they had a decline in the fourth quarter. They had such a strong year last year, particularly in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We may see a little bit of bumpiness through the year, but it's a great business. It's improving. We are seeing the recurring business and the mix start to turn back to where we like it. And so that's just throughout the year, maybe a little bit of a different performance than we're used to seeing from a steadiness perspective. Well, Toni, I would say, you know, all of our - we expect all of our businesses to perform very, very well. And in order for us to be able to guide in the way that we did from about flattish to up 70 basis points, we're going to need good performance out of all of our businesses. And that translates into very good incremental margins, especially in our Rental business. It's certainly, as Paul just described, it means that we're going to see some nice improvement in our First Aid margins as we see a bit of a mix shift. We expect continued good performance in our Fire business, as I think we mentioned 22% organic growth in the fourth quarter. We've got some great momentum, and we'll get some nice leverage as we move into the year. And then certainly, our Direct Sale business, those margins I would expect, from a percentage standpoint to really increase nicely, as we see those - see the revenue start to come back, that will allow us to get a little bit more efficient and certainly be able to leverage our infrastructure in that business. So we're looking for margin, good margin performance in all of our businesses all contributing to that guidance range, margin improvement and all contributing to a real healthy 20% to 30% incremental margins. Tim, our total energy costs for the quarter were 2.1% of revenue. That's up 30 basis points from the third quarter and that's up 40 basis points from a year ago. So we did certainly see some increase within the quarter. Our expectation is that those will remain elevated during fiscal '22, up at those levels, maybe even a little bit higher. So that's what we've got incorporated. Most of that increase being price at the pump, so our gas and our service, our routes. So that's what we've got in the guidance. Sure. From a CapEx perspective, clearly, the amounts were down in this past year because capacity needs just weren't the same as they had been in the previous years. We certainly kept up the CapEx for maintenance activities. But as we - there's a bit of a lag between when we need new capacity and when this revenue starts to - has started to come back. And we've seen some momentum, but there will be a little bit of a lag in the CapEx. Having said that, I expect we'll get back to historical levels by the end of the fiscal year. And that puts us probably in the $200 million to $250 million range for fiscal '22. But certainly, when we invest, we will certainly - when we need to invest, whether it's capacity, technology or otherwise, we will certainly do that. You know, I might add also that when you think about our First Aid and Safety and Fire businesses, the purpose of those businesses are to keep our customers, employees safe and healthy. And so it's a little bit of a different ESG angle than what Todd was talking about. But from an employee perspective, our goals are to help our customers really achieve the safety and the health of their employees. So we're looking out for them from that S perspective of the ESG as well."

            "content": "Thank you, Nick. And thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas' Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors; Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2021. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Hansen. Thanks, Mike. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care scrubs, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion compared to $1.27 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 410 basis points to 47.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter, driven in large part by lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. While some inflationary pressures increased certain costs, these were more than offset by increased revenue from businesses re-opening or increasing capacity as COVID-19 case counts fell and restrictions on businesses were reduced. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $186.9 million compared to $196.3 million last year. First Aid fourth quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's fourth quarter, in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment sales surged. Also, the first aid Cabinet Service business was not impacted until late in last year's fourth quarter when business restrictions became widespread. As a result, the division posted a 21.9% organic revenue growth rate in last year's fourth quarter. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 46.1% last year. The difference in gross margins is due to revenue mix. As we guided last quarter, less personal protective equipment was sold in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. However, as a percentage of total division revenue, personal protective equipment revenue was still a significant percentage, while profitable personal protective equipment revenue has lower gross margins than the first aid cabinet servicing business. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially as the cabinet servicing business continues to grow and gets closer to the pre-COVID percent of total division revenue. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $181.9 million compared to $152.3 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue increased 22.4%. Gross margin improved 70 basis points. Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue growth rate was 6.2%, and gross margin increased 280 basis points. I'll now turn the call over to Todd for our final prepared remarks. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Yeah, Manav, this is Paul. And I was just wanted to add that, we're so fortunate to have such a strong balance sheet, the cash flow is so strong. We did that buyback, and our leverage is 1.5 times, as we mentioned in the script. So fortunate to be in a position where you know, what we do with the dividend and the buyback doesn't preclude us from M&A or any other activities because of the strength of the balance sheet. And George, this is Paul. I just want to tell, you mentioned First Aid specifically too, so I just want to make sure we provided enough clarity there. That business, as Mike said, alluded to, it's in a transition period where, to Todd's point, so much PPE was provided. We seized the opportunity to come through for our customers and provide thermometers and masks and visors, et cetera. So it's an outsized percent of the revenue. That will transition, as we've been talking about the last couple of quarters. What I want to make sure everybody understands is that First Aid business is getting back to that more re-occurring revenue stream with that Cabinet Service business, which we are very excited about. And to think about a 9% or high single digit type of a growth rate for First Aid in fiscal '22, that's coming off a huge growth rate with a lot of PPE. So still a strong performance. And what I want to make sure people don't miss is that, in order to drive a high single digit growth rate in '22, with PPE declining, that Cabinet Service business is growing very strongly. And what that will do then is improve the margins going forward for the First Aid business in fiscal '22. And we probably won't get back all the way to pre-COVID levels in terms of margins in First Aid because, just like many of our businesses, it's a lot of small transactions. There's some momentum that has to build. But definitely, the margins will continue to improve through the year as we get back to servicing those cabinets. Yeah, Gary, it's Paul. And we do - yeah, Gary, we have that information for you, excuse me. And I would preface it by saying, first of all, what we provided typically is a Q4 sample, Q4 fiscal '21 versus fiscal '20. Obviously, there's a lot of noise in these figures, excuse me, in that you know, it's an unprecedented time. Fiscal '20 fourth quarter was the onset of the pandemic. So a lot of job losses, a lot of pandemic-driven demand, as Todd just said, for certain items of PPE. So I want to throw that out there first. But last year's fourth quarter, so fiscal '20 Q4, Uniform Rental was 50% of the segment mix. Dust, which is the walk-off mats, mops, that was 18% of the mix. Hygiene products, those are the soaps, the air fresheners, sanitizing dispensers, et cetera, that's 14% last year. Shop towels were 4%, linens 10 and the catalog business, which is more like the direct - small direct sales component of the Rental business products off of the route from the drivers, that was 4%. So, then this year's mix: uniform rental 48%; dust, 17%; hygiene at 17%; shop towels 4%; linens 9%; and catalog 5%. So again, obviously, COVID impacted results, not necessarily reflective of future performance. But with this breakout, you can obviously see how strongly hygiene performed. Typically, like in the Q4 of fiscal '20, that was mostly restroom type items, soaps and air fresheners, the paper. But in this Q4 '21, that hygiene percentage grew greater, driven by the sanitizer dispensers, the stands, the sanitizing sprays, et cetera. And then that catalog nudged up a little bit from 4% to 5%. And that's where a lot of the PPE in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business that we've talked about is recorded, the masks, gloves, those types of items. Yeah. The great news is, regarding our investment in the ERP system, SAP, that we've talked about a lot. I mean, a lot of that investment spending in that - some of the major expense is behind us, and it took us a while to roll it out and get the entire network into SAP. We had the G&K acquisition that added more locations and kind of slowed down the time to complete it. Then we had the pandemic. And so the exciting thing is the additional investment will continue to be made throughout the business, of course, still in technology. But a lot of it's already paid for. And now it's perfecting the system, taking the toy, so to speak, out of the box and not just using it for the Xs and Os of running the business, but using it to meet that competitive advantage to give us the data analytics and the other advantages that we haven't had previously. All right. Thanks, Nick. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter of fiscal '22 financial results in September. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day."

            "name": "Scott Farmer",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd. And I'd like to take this moment to thank all of my Cintas partners across the company. I'm proud of our many collective accomplishments, including the innovative products and services that we provide our customers, as well as the tremendous dedication of our employee partners without whom we wouldn't be successful. Our company is in a position of financial strength with the strongest and most experienced management team that we've ever had executing a proven strategy that has allowed our continued success even through the recent pandemic. It's been a true honor and privilege for me to have led this company as CEO for the last 18 years. And I'm as excited about our future as I've ever been, and I look forward to watching this leadership team steer us to continued success in the future. You bet. Thank you. And I would add that, that includes last fiscal year. We raised the wage rates of all of our hourly people in our distribution centers, offices, production, all of our service, frontline service personnel. So we don't have a big catch up as a result of that. I know there are other businesses out there that froze wages in the pandemic. And because it was a year, they might have a catch up to make, and we don't have that. So you know, I'm happy to say that. But I don't think that so far we've seen issues where the labor rates are going to cause us significant problems. But we're more concerned about what happens to our customers as a result of this. And so we'll be watching that very closely. Yeah. I would add, this is Scott. I would add that we think that Canada will be in the position that the US is sometime the end of the summer with re-openings, but they're on a steady pace heading in that direction. The biggest issue that we have is that businesses are open, but there are, what, about 7 million fewer people employed right now than they were pre-pandemic. And so there's a lot of room there. And I think as federal unemployment benefits subside in, what September, we hope to see that our customers that are open will be able to get themselves back to full staffing, and that will obviously benefit our business."

            "name": "Todd Schneider",
            "content": "Thanks, Paul. We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results that conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following. We help keep our customers' place of business clean, safe and Ready for the Workday by providing essential products and services. We procured hard to find and potentially life saving items such as face masks and gloves, provided hygienically clean health care scrubs and isolation gowns and developed services, including hand sanitizer dispensing, sanitizing spray services and disinfecting wipes. Our Net Promoter Scores reached an all-time high because we consistently delivered for our customers by providing needed products and services and being flexible with service agreement terms during the pandemic. We were again named to the prestigious Fortune 500, climbing 31 spots to rank at number 410 on the 2021 list. It's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We allocated capital to improve shareholder return. We paid down debt, reducing interest expense. We increased the annual dividend 10.2% and changed from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend to return cash to shareholders more timely. We've increased the dividend 37 consecutive years. Also in fiscal 2021 and up until today, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of Cintas stock for a total of $979 million. As part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our inaugural environmental, social and governance, or ESG report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity and supporting the communities where we do business. And in addition to these many accomplishments and despite the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we grew our fiscal year revenue and adjusted EPS. I can't thank our employee partners enough, and I'm so proud of their truly impressive achievements. The Cintas story is one of growth. We have grown revenue and adjusted EPS in 50 of the past 52 years. The only exceptions were the Great Recession years. Our successful long-term financial formula is organic revenue growth in the mid to high single digits, double-digit earnings per share growth, significant cash generation, improved deployment of excess cash to further generate strong shareholder returns. Our prospects for continued growth are great and a result in part from a strong value proposition and a vast total addressable market. We have a product or service to help nearly every business get Ready for the Workday. Examples include, scrubber rental to hospitals and dentists, hygiene supplies and services to professional services firms, floor care services, including walk-off mats and mops to retailers, first aid products to hotel and restaurant kitchens for cuts and burns, fire protection services to facilities managers and universities, and personal protective equipment to city maintenance and sanitation departments. The renting of health care scrubs and isolation gowns is indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Plus, we are so much more than a uniform company. More than half of our revenue is from facility services, including hygiene, floor care items such as walk-off mats and dust mops, cleaning tools like microfiber mops and towels, first aid cabinet services, personal protective equipment, and fire protection services, including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms. Our total addressable market is the 15 to 20 million businesses we don't currently service. Every business, goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in a greater focus on health, readiness and outsourcing of non-core activities. Significant opportunities for new revenues continue to exist because of the need of businesses to instil confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. The new services we launched, including hand sanitizer stand dispenser service and sanitizing spray service, have a long runway. Cintas consistently invest in technology to support growth. Our recent implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system provides benefits in three main areas. One is operational efficiencies. Our route drivers utilize personal route computers, which are similar to a cell phone, to access data and process transactions real time. Also, SAP enabled us to have visibility to laundered plant stock room [ph] inventories across our operations, helping improve profitability via the sharing and reuse of revenue producing assets. And the technology helps us improve working capital, be it tighter management of supply chain inventory. A second benefit is data analytics and enhanced business reporting. These result from having the order to cash cycle all in one system. SAP enables us to analyze, process and extract information from extremely large data sets, helping us target penetration, cross selling and pricing opportunities. And the third competitive advantage is improved customer service. Through SAP, our customers can pay bills and communicate with us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We expect the ease of doing business will help us improve customer retention. Also, customers can order products and services via SAP, resulting in improved turnaround time and faster realization of product and service revenue. I want to say a few more words regarding ESG. From the start of our company in the Great Depression, the Cintas business model was wholly based on sustainable practices, wash and reuse. We have a great corporate responsibility story to tell. We will continue to expand our ESG reporting and are excited about issuing our next report this year. And finally, I'd like to say thank you on behalf of all Cintas employee partners to Scott Farmer for his 18 years of service as Chief Executive Officer. Under Scott's leadership, the company's revenue grew from $2.69 billion in 2003 to $7.12 billion in fiscal 2021. Scott successfully led Cintas through years filled with challenges, changes and opportunities, including the Great Recession, our largest acquisition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the integration of SAP technology across the organization. We thank Scott for his service to the company as CEO, and we are grateful that he remains as Executive Chairman. Andrew, this is Todd. It's a great question. We're in a good staffing position. We like where we are there. We like the fact that we've been addressing this subject over the course of a number of years. And as Scott pointed out appropriately, even in the peak of the pandemic last year, we were committed to staying the course and do the right things and taking care of our hourly partners to - because we knew that we could see things coming, right, and we're committed to it. So that's important to us. Certainly, other input costs are cost of goods. And our supply chain team is working harder than ever, and they are doing a great job in managing through that process to get us the goods that we need to make sure we're servicing our customers, which are doing a great job at, and to manage our cost structure from that standpoint. But we like the spot we're in, and we anticipate getting, hopefully some leverage on the additional revenue that we bring in. We've done such a great job and took such a big jump forward from fiscal '20 to fiscal '21 that as Mike stated, it will be a shame to go backwards, and we're focused on going forward. So Andrew, Mike talked about pricing being a local subject, re-opening is a local subject as well. But for the most part, most businesses are back. Certainly, Canada has been a little slower to come back because of vaccination rates and government impacts there. But nevertheless, in general, most businesses are back. Now are they back at the levels that we think they will be in the future? No, and we're committed to helping them with our valuable products and services to help them be prepared as their employees come back and their customers come back, so that they can be - they can compete in the marketplace. So hopefully, that helps. Yeah, Manav. this is Todd. So I think you've seen through our guidance, we expect a range of 5.8 to 7.2 from a growth rate. When you think about - obviously, the rental division is our, by far, our largest division, so that will be in that range. But we expect that all of our businesses, meaning the other businesses, Fire, First Aid and our Direct Sale business, will all be high single digit growth businesses in this fiscal year. So we feel very positive about all of them, and I look forward to growth in each of those businesses. Yeah. So our commitment is still number one priority is to invest back into our business, to grow the number of customers we have and grow those customers and invest in our infrastructure. Our second one is to invest in M&A. And we are very focused on M&A, active in that area and it's a big push for us. And then third, if there is - consistent with what our approach has been in the past, if there is capital that is in excess of that, then we'll return it back to the shareholders in the form of increasing dividend and repurchase of the stock as appropriate. So Andrew, this is Todd. As we look at the business, certainly, the hospitality business is - you read about it in the papers, right? You see - you hear about bookings, whether it's airlines or hotels, et cetera. That is a vertical that we think will be quite positive this year. The health care vertical is going to continue to be strong for us. Hospitals are catching up on voluntary type of procedures, which is helping that. And we have a very attractive value proposition in both of those areas as well. Education, government are both - we expect to be quite strong for us. There was a the mix of business, I think, you will see will be different in those areas, less PPE and more focused on more of a traditional type of approach that we've had in the past. But those key verticals are all positioned well. And if you think of them all, they are all positioned quite well, hospitality probably the best. Yeah. I would say I don't - none come to mind where I would say, yes, a slower type of growth. It's just - we're kind of a rising tide is the best way to put it. Yeah, Ryan. This is Todd. We like our position in the Fire business and really like the Fire business. There, we understand the - how to go to market and how to make attractive margins in that business. And we're investing, we're investing in M&A, we're investing in infrastructure to make sure that we're able to service all of our customers. And we have a national offering in that business, some via sub-contracting. But nevertheless, a very attractive national approach, and we're positioned well. How we - our culture, our infrastructure, how we execute puts us in a good spot. And there's good momentum in that business. There was - you think about it, right? It's all - legally, you have to have that - those products and those services. But nevertheless, there was some pent up demand in it from repairs, right. So if you think about someone comes through and looks at your fire equipment, and there are some items that need to be repaired. During the pandemic, people are more so anxious to spend money on those types of subjects and - but as we're coming out of it, we're busy, we're busy in that area for many reasons, one of which is some pent up demand on repair, which is great business for us. Yeah, great question. So when you think about, let's call it, PPE items that were really pandemic related, they are still at levels elevated from pre-pandemic, but we do not expect them to repeat at the levels that they were in fiscal '21. So if you think about our guidance, we think we would be - with the PPE that doesn't repeat, if it has - if it does repeat, then we would be in the, you know, on the high end, above 8% from an internal growth rate. So think about it that way about how much is - will not be repeating, that we don't expect to repeat, which kind of demonstrates the mix of business is going to be back closer - much closer to traditional. And there is some real good momentum there to get to the growth rates that we've guided towards. George, I'm glad you asked about that. I have been so impressed by our sales organization, the creativity, the flexibility, the urgency, the intensity about which way they go about their jobs and how they have adapted to a crazy environment. And we try to work very hard to position them with great products and services so that people very much want to take their calls. And so we like where that's heading. The mix of business is obviously changing, but it's getting back to much more traditional, George. But there is a strong audience for the - our sales partners and in whom they are calling on, partly because there were some items that you - when people were going through the pandemic, they said, hey, I can't make a decision on uniforms right now, but I need some critical products to help my business run. We provided those critical products and services and its positioned us, now that it's closer to businesses getting back to normal, where we say, okay, now I'm ready to talk about those types of items. So all that is positive for us. You know, as we went through it, folks didn't realize that we had all the products and services that we do. So that opens some doors, and we're continuing to operate in those doors to help improve our business. Yes, George, I'll start and Mike, Scott, Paul, if they want to jump in. We've spoken in the past about hygiene, cleanliness, all those subjects that the pandemic has done for those subjects what 9/11 did to security 20 years ago. And so what we're seeing is there's a greater focus on the health of employees, health of patients, health of guests, students, and hygiene is a big part of that. So we see that as something that will be elevated into the future, and we think that's good for society, that's good for our business and good certainly for all those individuals. So we think that's going to be something that's elevated, hopefully, in perpetuity. As far as PPE normalization, there is - there was a breakneck pace to get PPE last year because folks couldn't keep their doors open in certain cases couldn't work. So there was some real peaks last year. That is certainly less. We expect this year the variants, the delta variant, I think, brings a bit of a wildcard into that, which we're not going to try to predict. But nevertheless, as you see, as we go throughout the year, you will see much more normalization. You'll see more people using our traditional cabinets, First Aid products, hands and cabinets as we say, and PPE will be more moderate. Now just keep in mind, we've always been in the PPE business. We've always provided these products and services, it's just they were elevated. We will continue to offer them. But as more people get back to work in offices and machine shops, in government and education, there will be more people that will be consuming, from a first aid standpoint, our traditional types of bandages and tablets, et cetera. So hopefully, that gives you a little color. Toni, the - obviously, we're guiding towards all of our businesses growing, incremental margins 20% to 30%. But when you think about it, obviously, the mix is going to change in all those businesses. And each of them sold, with the exception of Fire, there was some PPE. And so there's - we'll get back to more traditional type of mix. And that and the leverage on the additional revenue is going to help us. Yes. Toni, the outsourcing trends continue, that has been positive. In addition, the focus on bringing manufacturing back to the United States and Canada, we think will be a positive, just that's obviously in the early innings. But both of those, we think, will be positives for our business. As far as reaching out, we have a significant investment in our infrastructure. And part of that infrastructure is in our route base, and part of that is in our sales organization. So that is a - that's a significant investment. You've probably also seen, I hope you've seen some of our investment in mass media that we're leveraging. Because we think it can pay dividends for that infrastructure. And there are one more thing we hear from customers and prospects, frankly, is, hey, I didn't know you did that. That is a product or a service that they didn't realize that we provided. So we're trying to leverage that and get the message out and to give a little air cover to our infrastructure. Tim, this is Todd. I'll start. We don't see momentum slowing down in that area. Again, hospitals are getting a little bit back to more normal operations of how they run their business, and our value proposition resonates with them. We've talked often about the various products and services that we provide, scrubs being a big one, isolation gowns, but also cleaning products to help them provide a healthy environment. So there is a whole lot more focus on health and welfare now. Obviously, in the health care business, because of what they do for a living, there's always been a major focus on providing an environment that allowed for high patient satisfaction, that was not only in health, but also in image. So its - when you think about what they need, it's a great vertical for us and the products and services we provide. And there is a long runway there. We're providing products and services to help institutions that - I'd like to think you'd be impressed by the name of - the list of people we do business with. So who's who in that business. But nevertheless, we're not nearly as penetrated as where we can be, should be and will be. So we're very much in the early innings on that vertical still. So Gary, as far as the First Aid, yeah, think about it as high single digits for the year. As Mike stated, Q4 last year, Q1 - excuse me, Q4 of '20 was a huge growth rate for the First Aid business, as was Q1, so the comp from right now were really big. So as the year goes on, the PPE will - the comp will lessen. And as a result, our growth rates will be better in that business. So the bumpiness that Mike spoke about is simply the PPE comps in the early portions of this fiscal year versus last. As far as the Rental, yeah, as we mentioned in the past, there's PPE in that - in our results from last year in Rental as well. And again, just going back to our total guidance if the PPE would repeat, that we do not believe it will, this year, then you'd be into the - the number would start with an eight as far as internal growth. So how far into the eight? I really don't know. But nevertheless, we'd be picking up a heck of a lot of basis points in growth if that PPE repeated. So it's a headwind. We're proud that we provided the product to our customers. Our customers really valued it. It opened doors. Excuse the pun, but it kept their doors opened in many cases. And our Net Promoter Scores reflect it. So they were very appreciative that we were able to provide those products and services. If they need them again, we'll provide them. We just don't think that they'll be at the levels that they were in the past. Scott, I'll say each of our businesses were acquisitive, but tuck-ins, certainly, some geographic expansion as well. So we're highly active. And there is folks that are at least answering phones and they are taking calls, and we'll see where that goes. Certainly, you wonder about changes to tax, potential changes to taxes, will that free things up? That will be interesting to see what happens with that. As far as the size and multiples, those types of things, you know, there's - everything's come from the very small to medium sized types, I won't comment on else, but it's - they're all active. And part of it is because multiples, if you look at it historically in the marketplace, they're pretty high. But we're quite active in that area because we look at it from a very long-term approach. And we know when we make those types of acquisitions that it positions us to grow those as well. Because of our broad offering of products and services that we bring to the table that in many cases, the folks that we're speaking to don't have that broadness, it allows for us to take a long-term approach and grow those businesses, whether it's just in that area of the business or cross selling it across each of our enterprise. Great. I'll start with the tech question, and then Mike can handle the CapEx, if he prefers. Scott, we're investing heavily there because we see a need to - from a - whether it's productivity or from a competitive advantage. All areas of our business, we talked about leveraging SAP, leveraging the platforms that come along with that, they have customer benefits and operational benefits for us, and then obviously, the data that goes along with that. But that being said, we see some opportunities in automation that we've been investing in over the years. And we see opportunities to get efficiencies out of our fleet that we're investing in that we think can pay big dividends in that area. And so we're focused on doing such and making it easier to do business with Cintas. So - and we think, as you do that, that provides leverage for us. So leverage in the marketplace. So Mike, I'll let you handle the CapEx question. So Bryan, I don't have a specific number for you, but just generally speaking, I'd say most businesses are back to some degree, not certainly back to full bore. We mentioned Canada specifically as an outlier, which we expect, let's just say, by August, September to be back much closer to normal. But one of the big issues is there are 7 million people less working today than there were a year ago or so. And of those 7 million people, I don't know what - how many of them are Cintas wearers or will be, but there's a percentage of. And we want those to - certainly see those folks get back to work. And whether they're wearing uniforms or utilizing our First Aid products and services, all that impacts us. So the - for the most part, businesses are back. They're certainly not anywhere near where we think they will be over time. Yeah. Bryan, great question. Again, our heritage, what we do - and frankly, as I'm speaking of the Rental business, what our industry does, the impact that it has on saving customers water, energy, what we do to treat water instead of it going down into the sewer. Because those products, whether they're garments or towels or what have you, all that, they're going to be either purchased and thrown in the garbage or purchased and cleaned at home. And in both cases, we are helping substantially those folks helping the environment and helping to save landfill space, helping to fill or excuse me, save water, energy and the cleanliness of water as well. And I don't think we've told the story well enough in the past, because at our heritage, we are a wash and reuse business. And again, without our industry, there would be millions of more gallons and units of energy and et cetera that will be utilized because they're going to be either thrown to the landfill or laundered somehow. And we know that we are infinitely more efficient at laundering those products than they would be at home or in another type of setting."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President, Treasurer,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:08:00 2021 ] and Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nPaul Adler: Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas\u2019 Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Schneider, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:13:00 2021 ] and it remains a significant disruption to the economy. Our fiscal third quarter,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:14:00 2021 ] which included the months of December, January,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:14:00 2021 ] and February was particularly challenging. COVID-19 case counts surged from about 180,000 on December 1 to a peak of little over 300,000 on January 8. Not surprisingly, economic indicators reflected an economic recovery that slowed considerably. In December, the U.S. economy posted job losses again after seven straight months of job gains. The operating environment was also challenged by severe winter weather. The snow and ice storm in February caused extensive energy blackouts in the U.S., especially in the state of Texas. Despite a very difficult operating environment in late December and into January, our sales rep productivity remained strong and our employee partners persevered enabling us to offset the headwinds and get to flat on a sequential basis. On top of that, we were able to help our customers with large supplies of personal protective equipment before the end of the quarter. We provided more personal protective equipment than ever, enabling us to exceed our financial expectations. Also, on an organic basis, our quarterly revenue was flat year-over-year, a strong accomplishment considering the comparison to the prior year quarter that was not impacted by COVID-19. Looking ahead to our fourth quarter, we expect lower COVID-19 case counts to be the foundation for improved operating environment. We do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will be as strong, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. However, we believe that our recurring revenue service -- service revenue will increase solidly on a sequential basis after being flat in the third quarter. Mike will provide more information regarding our fourth quarter guidance soon. Regardless of the operating environment, our employee partners worked with urgency to get businesses ready for the workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021  ]Ready for the Workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021 ].

Our partners are honored to be deemed essential. They are ready to listen, ready to offer solutions, ready to solve problems, and ready to be counted on to deliver, and they do. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mike for commentary on our financial results. Mike?\nMike Hansen: Thank you, Scott. Our fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue was $1.78 billion compared to $1.81 billion in last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays was flat for the third quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was also flat. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 17.7%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $809.5 million compared to $824.4 million in last year's third quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points to 45.6% for the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 45.5% in the third quarter of fiscal '20. This increase was despite one less workday in this year's third quarter compared to last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.2% last year. Fiscal '21 third quarter results benefited from increased sales rep productivity and lower discretionary spending. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '21 of $326.5 million increased 3.8%. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 18.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was 14.4% compared to 18.9% last year. The tax rate can move from period-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021 ]to-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021 ]period based on discrete events,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021 ] including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $258.4 million, an increase of 10.2%. And again, EPS was $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. During the third quarter of fiscal '21, we purchased $82 million of Cintas' common stock under our buyback programs. Earlier this week,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:35:00 2021  ] on March 15, Cintas paid shareholders $79.5 million in quarterly dividends. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. One more workday will benefit fiscal '21 full revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, the fourth quarter contained 65 workdays. This fiscal year's fourth quarter contains 66. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:36:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:36:00 2021 ]year-over-year and sequential basis. For our fourth quarter, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.83 billion,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:36:00 2021 ] and diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.40. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22.5%. Please note that our guidance does not include any future share buybacks or additional government restrictions on businesses in the event of increasing COVID-19 cases. We are encouraged by vaccinations, stimulus,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:37:00 2021 ] and business reopenings,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:37:00 2021 ] and we expect an improved operating environment in our fourth quarter. We expect recurring revenue to increase solidly on a day adjusted sequential basis in the range of about 1% to 2.5%, after being flat in the third quarter. However, we do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will remain at record levels, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. Please keep in mind these points when comparing our fourth quarter guidance to third quarter results. Our fiscal fourth quarter marks the lapping of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our prior year fourth quarter coincided with a period of greatest GDP decline and job losses resulting from unprecedented restrictions on businesses to help combat the surge of COVID-19 cases. While the pandemic continues, our fourth quarter financial results, including revenue growth will benefit in part from an easier comparison. Our last year's fourth quarter operating income was also significantly affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. These included additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:39:00 2021 ] and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, last year's fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%. All these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow moving inventory mostly in the Uniform Direct S[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:39:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:39:00 2021  ]ale business, where customers and some of the most severely impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist. Please keep these points in mind when comparing our fiscal fourth quarter financial guidance to the prior year quarter. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses.\nTodd Schneider: Thanks, Mike. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:40:00 2021  ]care scrubs, mats,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:40:00 2021 ] and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.42 billion compared to $1.45 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 50 basis points to 46.3% for the third quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's third quarter, driven in large part to lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:41:00 2021 ] and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $198.5 million compared to $170.5 million last year. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.5% in the third quarter compared to 48.0% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin is due to revenue mix. In the pandemic, the needs of businesses for personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves has skyrocketed. Even though personal protective equipment is a less predictable revenue stream with lower gross margins than the relatively consistent first aid cabinet service, personal protective equipment is a profitable product line,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:43:00 2021 ] and we continue to work with urgency to fulfill the needs of businesses. Also note that on a sequential basis, First Aid segment gross margins and operating margins have improved through the pandemic. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $160.7 million compared to $192.1 million last year. The Fire business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:43:00 2021  ] organic revenue increased 3.5%, the Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue growth rate was minus 39.7%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:44:00 2021 ] and gaming customers are largely realized within this business line. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.\nTim Mulrooney: Good morning, Scott, Todd, Mike, and Paul. My question, I just have one for you this morning on the Uniform Rental segment. Operating margins in this business have ticked up nicely in 2021, and I think some of that was from structural cost savings,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021  ] and may [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021 ]be some from temporary cost savings. Moving forward, would you expect uniform operating margins to kind of normalize towards that pre-pandemic run rate over time or would you expect t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021 ]h[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021 ]e [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021 ]operating margins to kind of settle at a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:45:00 2021 ]somewhat higher level than the pre-pandemic run rate? Thank you.\nScott Farmer: Well, Tim, this is Scott. I\u2019[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021 ]d[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021 ] will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021  ]start by saying that there have been a lot of expenses this year that we have been able to control tightly, discretionary spending, travel, things like that, that impact the P&L. How much of that returns, I'm not sure. I mean, we wanted an awful lot, we don't necessarily have to have the large group meetings where everybody is travel[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021  ]ling into one town to accomplish that. Some of that will happen, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:47:00 2021  ]a lot of that probably won't. But I'd say that in our sequential -- in our recurring revenue businesses, as the economy continues to, I think, improve, you're going to see us need to add some expense back on to the P&L. That might be growth routes in the rental division as an example. Jobs that would help us with growth, additional salespeople, sales training, additional headcount in t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:47:00 2021 ]he [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021 ]production operations to be able to process things. So, I wouldn't expect a linear improvement, but I would tell you that we do think that we will continue to see 20% to 30% incremental margins,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021  ] as we add the sales line back on to the P&L, and over time I think that we can maintain margins that will be at least at or above, probably above where we work [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021  ]were [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021 ]pre-pandemic, so that's how I would answer that. Does that help you?\nTim Mulrooney: That's really helpful, honest[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:49:00 2021 ]. Honest[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:49:00 2021  ], thoughtful answer. I appreciate that. Scott, thanks for taking my question.\nScott Farmer: Okay. Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, there. A question for Todd. When you think of rentals being flat in the just reported quarter, could you just give us a sense of, you know,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:50:00 2021 ] how much ancillary services is contributing versus are you seeing improvement in Uniform Rentals as well? And a quick comment on how dependent are you in some of the areas like restaurants that are still kind of opening up ahead?\nTodd Schneider: Andrew, great question. We had -- as was mentioned in the prepared remarks, demand for various items around PP&E and et cetera, other items regarding the pandemic was very strong in Q3. That was a result of what was going on with case counts, and you all saw that. So, that was significant for us to the tune of about $45 million more than in Q2. We don't see that as repeating -- that level repeating in Q4, but But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:51:00 2021  ]we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in business coming back. So, you can see in our sequential improvement, what we see coming in Q4 over Q3, even without that level, that elevated level of those types of products and services. As far as restaurants, et [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:51:00 2021 ]cetera, that's certainly a component of our business. We are encouraged by what we're seeing there with folks\u2019[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:52:00 2021  ] activity increasing, consumer spending increasing. We think people having money in their pockets via stimulus will help that, and we sure hope that small business folks who have been incredible about weathering the storm, that their demand starts to pick up even more. So, we're encouraged by what we see.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.\nScott Farmer: Andrew, if I could just add a point of clarification of the $45 million that Todd referred to, that is in the rental segment as well as the First Aid segment. You saw our First Aid segment had another very good quarter at 17.7%. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:53:00 2021 ] we're seeing demand in all of these different kinds of things in -- from all of our customers, and we're doing our best to meet those demands. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:53:00 2021 ] it's -- that $45 million is not all within the rental segment, it's in all of our businesses.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. If you exclude the $45 million in PPE lift in the Uniform Rentals business, could you perhaps talk about how revenue trends progressed moving through fiscal 3Q?\nScott Farmer: Yes. George, but to Mike's point that $45 million was spread out across the -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:54:00 2021  ]all of our divisions, it wasn't just a rental lift, but relative to what happened in Q3, I think it's important that we all keep in mind that our third quarter often is a little less predictable than the rest of our year, and this [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021 ]. This [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021  ]year was as well. It has two holidays in it with Christmas and New Year and our customers sometimes take multiple days off depending on what days[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021 ] those holidays fall on. There's always a potential of weather issues with the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021  ]snow and ice storms and things like that, and both of those things happened this year, and if you combine that with increasing COVID cases, it made it a little bit more complicated than it normally does. I would say as we went into the third quarter, we were very concerned about what we were seeing. COVID cases were on the rise. I\u2019ve said earlier in my remarks that the economy shed jobs for the first time in s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021 ]even [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021 ]7 months in December. So, December and into January, really even into February, we saw a very difficult economic environment, but as we got into February, we started to see our recurring revenues[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021  ] start to pick back up. Cases were dropping dramatically from -- I want to say, maybe the second week in January, the expected restrictions, the [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]indi[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]c[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021 ]ernible[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]govern[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]ce [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]that we thought were going to put on businesses didn't fully materialize. And so, the -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021  ]we built some momentum in February that we continued[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021 ] to see as we moved into March, and I think that is reflected in the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up to that, if you look at new business trends and plans for sales force hiring, can you talk a little bit about how the pipeline is building?\nScott Farmer: We're very pleased with our pipeline. Our sales rep productivity continues to be at very, very high levels. We believe that the -- our value proposition is resonating today in the economy more than ever. So we're excited about our opportunities as we look out into the future. Our[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]--[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]T[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021 ]t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]here are 16 million or roughly 16 million businesses in the United States and Canada, and we do business with a million of them. And we really like our opportunity as we approach hopefully the end of this pandemic, and a more normalized economy of our ability to do [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021  ]attract new customers. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] we're -- the pipeline is relatively full,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] and the reps are performing at high levels, even considering the fact that many times they're making sales calls over a virtual Teams [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ]teams [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021  ]call or Zoom call and being successful in doing it. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] we're excited about getting past this pandemic and getting into a normal economy. We think we'll be -- we are well-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021 ]positioned to take advantage of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning. My question is a little bit more big picture. Pre-COVID, I guess your long-term growth rate was sort of 6% to 8% depending on the year. In a post-COVID world, and you touched on a little bit of this with some of the ancillary services that may be benefited from the pandemic,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021 ] which may normalize. But at the same time, you have these newer verticals you've penetrated, there's some structural outsourcing, maybe in health [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021  ]care that could be a tailwind. I don't know if that sort of plateaued out or it continues, so [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021 ]. So [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021  ]when you put all the puts and takes together in a post-COVID world, do you expect your growth rate to be better than what it was prior to the pandemic on a normalized basis,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021  ] as you look out over the next couple of years?\nScott Farmer: Hamzah, that\u2019s tough for us to predict. I'm not sure that I'm going to go out and say that we're going to be doing better than we were from a percentage growth standpoint, post-pandemic and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021  ]than [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021 ]we were pre-pandemic. But as I\u2019ve said, we really like where we're positioned. We've made a lot of investments in the business that we think are beginning to pay off, that allow us to move quicker to be a better supplier to customers. Our customer satisfaction rates that we measure with Net Promoter S[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021  ]cores are at all-time highs, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021  ]we have opened up new segments of opportunity for us. We have new products and services that we can offer to more and more businesses. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ] I'll just answer that by saying, we think we're very well-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]positioned, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ]we're excited about the future.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it.\nTodd Schneider: Hamzah, if I could -- this is Todd. Just to [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]expand upon what Scott\u2019[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ] is [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ]saying, the real unknown is what is going to happen with the demand for some of these additional services that we've been able to provide, here's what we know is that demand is going to be higher in the future than it was pre-pandemic. And what's exciting is, many of our customers didn't even realize that we offered[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:50:00 2021 ] those types of products and services in the past. Let me be clear, there's nothing positive that came out of the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:51:00 2021 ]pandemic, right, but if there is any silver linings, it[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:51:00 2021 ] is the fact that our customers understand more the value that we can provide them, an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ]d[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ] as [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021  ]Scott mentioned that our NPS scores are reflecting that. And we think that is a -- the more the products and services our customers procure from us, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021  ]the more value we're bringing to them, and we think that is very positive. The other item that I think is important to understand is that we're going on 2 years now without having had a price adjustment to our customers. We have felt very passionate that it was not the appropriate time to adjust pricing when people are going through so much difficulties fighting through [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]for [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]the pandemic. And as a result of that,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ] -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]again,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ] our customers had [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]did[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]really appreciated that and truly positioned us well for the future. We look at the lifetime value of a customer and we think it is worth more than a short-term approach, so [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]. So [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]hopefully all that cover [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]co[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]lor [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]helps.\nHamzah Mazari: Yes, that's very helpful. And just my follow-up question and I'll turn it over. Just on the Fire business, I know it's a smaller business for you, but it's a good business. Could you maybe talk about how you're thinking about scaling that business up? And the reason I ask is, we look at the First Aid business and you did ZEE Medical in 2015,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:54:00 2021 ] and that business scaled up. Does Fire have the same potential in your mind,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:54:00 2021 ] and maybe if you could just talk about the competitive dynamic in that business.[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:54:00 2021 ]?[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:54:00 2021  ]\nScott Farmer: Yes. The -- we do think the Fire business has an opportunity to scale up. There are lots and lots and lots of small independent players, there [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ]. There [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021  ]are regional players, there are some PE groups that are doing some regional roll-ups[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ]rollouts[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021  ]. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ] there are opportunities for us to make some acquisitions in that business that would help us ramp up scale and geographic coverage. It is a very good business. One of the things that is important to understand is that different states have different licensing requirements for the level of different reps that we have, service technicians that we've had out there performing different levels of service be it [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ]via [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021  ]fire extinguisher repair and replacement versus sprinkler systems and alarm systems. They [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ],[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021  ] they [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021  ]have different certification levels that they have to have. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ] it's different than just hiring somebody off of the street,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ] and us being able to train them to be a First Aid service rep. These people need to get state certifications and licensing and things like that. But that said, we like our ability to grow in the geographies that we're in. There's a lot of geography that we would like to expand into, and there are lots of opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions in the markets that we're in right now. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ] we really like that business. And I think over time, we can scale that up to be of size [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]. I always tell the division presidents, including Fire and First Aid, that their job is to figure out how to get their division to be at least a $1 billion in revenue, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021  ]that's what they should be thinking about. And that helps us put goals in place and decide what type of resources we want to invest in the different businesses and so forth, bu[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]t [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021  ]we clearly think that both First Aid and Fire divisions can be over a $1 billion in revenue for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with RW. Baird.\nAndrew Wittmann: Great, and thanks for taking my questions. I had one question and then a follow-up. I guess, on the -- the first question here maybe, Mike, over the years Cintas' growth has been fairly consistent in the characteristics that comprises between things like price and stocks and new accounts, even retention from \u2013[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:58:00 2021 ] to [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:58:00 2021 ]some extent. I mean, in normal times, we have a pretty good sense about how that contributes to your year-over-year growth rate. Now that the next few quarters are going to be driven more by a reopening-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:59:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:59:00 2021  ]type growth rate, I was wondering if you talk about which of those factors you think will contribute more than their historical percentage to the growth and maybe less, just [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:59:00 2021 ]. Just [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:59:00 2021  ]to understand how you're thinking about how this matters and it [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:59:00 2021 ]will unfold in the next few months or quarters.\nScott Farmer: Yes, Andrew, it's been a -- it certainly has been a different environment operating in the last four quarters, and one that's been pretty unpredictable. I think what we'll see, what we've guided to in the fourth quarter and likely will get us off to a start in the first quarter of '22,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021  ] is the continued reopening of businesses and getting those businesses back to somewhat normalized operations. We were on a nice trajectory of that towards the end of our first quarter of [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]this year and into our second quarter that certainly took a pause, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021  ]we've got a lot of customers that still are either not opened or at limited capacity. And so, I think as we look at the next couple o[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]f [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]quarters, maybe even the most of fiscal '22, it's going to be about fully reopening the economy and getting those -- getting our customers and other businesses back to healthy operating environments. That means we'll take businesses off of held [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]a health [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ]status in the rental division. We'll start this [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ]to service First Aid cabinets again at a greater pace. We'll start to understand the needs,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ] when they open and come off of hold, how can we help them in this new type of environment with all of the things that we've talked about that have been important. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:02:00 2021 ] I think it's going to be more of that. The reopening of the economy and getting back to some normal type of process than anything else.\nAndrew Wittmann: That's helpful. Then just for [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:55:00 2021 ]from a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:55:00 2021  ]follow-up, I wanted to just talk about inflation a little bit. There's been obviously a lot talked about and it seems like there's a lot of merit given the amount of stimulus that's going to be hitting the system here. [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:55:00 2021 ]It[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ]\u2019[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ] -- its [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021  ]already hitting the system. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ] I was hoping, Mike, you could talk a little bit about where inflation could hit you, where you might be seeing it today or expect to see it tomorrow. Obvious, areas that [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021  ]come to mind like energy and be curious as to your thoughts and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021  ]on [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ]how that impacts the outlook here for the calendar '21?[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021 ].[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:56:00 2021  ] But also, maybe even in some of the products that you're selling in the ancillary business and in First Aid, labor, obviously, if you could just address inflation, how you affect [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:57:00 2021  ]-- how you expect it [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:57:00 2021 ]to affect you and your ability to recover it in pricing against a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:57:00 2021  ]recovering, but still not full bore macro. Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Yes. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:57:00 2021 ] from a -- I'll say a short-term, we could certainly see changes in gas prices at the pump. We saw sequentially an increase in our energy percentage of about 10 basis points, and that certainly could contribute over the course of the next year. I think labor is certainly in the news and the conversations about wage rates is likely to have some impact on us as well as our customers. We could see, as you mentioned, certainly in some of the PPE, we have seen quite dramatic changes in prices, in costs to us in terms of gloves and masks and sanitizer over the course of the last year, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021  ]there's probably a little bit of that continued unpredictability in that kind of product. But, Andrew, the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021  ]really good news and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021  ]in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021 ]all of that is we've got great efficiency in our business. And so, many times we're able to offset that with current initiatives that we have within the business. But if we can't, we certainly can look to pricing changes into the future. Todd mentioned, we have not liked that idea. In the last year, we did not think it's the right thing to do. But[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:59:00 2021  ], and it's been 2 years really since we've done it. But if we see inflation peak, that's an opportunity that we will certainly have to consider. And usually in the past, that's allowed us to pass on a good portion of those kind of costs,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:20:00 2021  ] if we can't offset them within our operations.\nTodd Schneider: Andrew, it's Todd. Just to build upon that, everything Mike said is right on target. We're in a good position to withstand those adjustments based upon our model, our efficiencies that we can bring to market. But with all these, whether it's inflation in general,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:20:00 2021  ] or wage inflation specifically, our biggest concern is always the impact to our customers. We will manage our business, we will do it so appropriately. But if it affects our customer base, then that's a much greater concern. And we're hoping that the health of those smaller businesses has been tested, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:21:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:21:00 2021  ]we're in hopes that they can continue to expand and thrive in the new environment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. Just wanted to ask about the SAP benefits that you are seeing just now that the integration within Rental has been completed. I know we're sort of in an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021 ] unique period, but just wanted to see if any of those are coming through now or for [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021  ]we should be expecting it going forward,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021  ] just anecdotally any benefits from the SAP program. Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Toni, this is Todd. We are seeing very nice efficiencies from having beyond for the most part one platform for the entire organization benefiting our customers in one view of Cintas. It's benefiting our locations in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021  ]and[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021 ]the ability to share inventory, our distribution centers in order to be able to anticipate needs. It's been quite impactful and a lot of positive things that have come out of having that one platform and the efficiencies that come along with it both for the customer, but also internally have been very encouraging.\nToni Kaplan: Great. I wanted to also ask about capital allocation. If we hit a period now where demand accelerates, do [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021 ]you expect to be investing more back into the business for organic growth opportunities or M&A, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021  ]I saw you\u2019re buying back some stock in the quarter. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021 ] does that get back to historical levels, just [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021 ]? Just [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:23:00 2021  ]what are you thinking about allocating capital?\nScott Farmer: Well, if we start with CapEx, we're still sort of managing through the unpredictability of the economy. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] we're probably a little more conservative right now and will be in the fourth quarter. But over time, I think our CapEx spend as the economy turns around and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021  ]will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ]get back to a more normalized historical type,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] and that's typically roughly 60% based on growth and 40% on maintenance. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] I think we'll continue to see that type of spend. We do generate a lot of cash. We've got a very strong balance sheet. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] we would be interested in acquisitions in all of our businesses. And then,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:25:00 2021  ] obviously, the dividend is important to our shareholders. We have continued to be in a position where we could increase the dividend to our shareholders every year since we went public, and obviously that is a streak that we'd like to see continue. And then, yes, finally, we do have roughly a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]$1 billion left on our authorization, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]that is more sort of opportunistic from time-to-time as we see opportunities to acquire our own stock. And so, should we be in a position where we're building cash and we think the opportunity is right, I think that the Board would agree that we would be in a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]position to buy back some of our stock. You [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]W[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]e [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]saw a little bit of that in the third quarter,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ] when the stock price went down. And so, it -- I think that I wouldn't be surprised to see that sort of thing in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.\nGary Bisbee: Hey, guys, good morning. It's impressive to get back to flat year-over-year same day sales, I guess, a quarter really before lapping the step down from the pandemic. I wanted to ask about mix within that sale. So, can you give us a sense of how meaningful PP&E sanitizers and other pandemic driven sales are to the current revenue levels? And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:27:00 2021 ] how much the more normal historical mix would still be down, right in Q3 without that? That's the first question.\nScott Farmer: Well, let me start by saying that things like the hand sanitizer and some of the sanitation products and wipes that we have fit into a recurring revenue stream,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ] once we put this like the restroom supplies, once we put the stand out there,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ] we come in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ]an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]d[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]service and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ]it [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]on a regular basis, make sure they have enough product in there to make it through till their next delivery and so forth. So that is -- that becomes part of the recurring revenue stream. The other products, things like disposable gloves, disposable face masks,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] and things like that are the one-time PPE sale, I[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] refer to it as one time, but it's more of a direct sale that it can fluctuate up and down depending on customer needs. But we have -- a lot of it depends on geography, it depends on the industry that the customer is in, some distribution-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021  ]type businesses they've increased headcount, increased number of wares, we -- other businesses have reduced the number of wares. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] it's a little bit all over the board trying to put some parameter on that relative to historical average.[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ],[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021  ] I'd say recurring revenue with the understanding that some of that is now the result of hand sanitizer and that's where it is flat through the quarter. And we think that that revenue is going to pick up as the economy turns around, as our customers get back to being able to open their businesses more fully,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ] bring back some of their headcount, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021  ]I believe that an awful lot of the recurring business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ] like hand sanitizer is here to stay. I have said in the past,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ] and I continue to believe that it's going to be a long time before a typical American walks into a business, walks into a restaurant, a lobby, a movie theate[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ]re[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021  ], any place and he isn't looking for a hand sanitizer station after they grabbed the doorknob going in and out of a public building. We're seeing that in stadiums, we're seeing that at -- in hotels that are open, at elevator stations, and that sort of thing[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ].[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ]that's where[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021  ] I think that's going to be here to stay. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ] if I'm right about that, as they bring back and open up their operations more fully, that will be revenue,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021  ] as they add people back on revenue on top of where they are right now.\nTodd Schneider: Gary, this is Todd. I think it's important to understand also the vast majority of the products and services we're speaking of, whether it's face shields, gloves, hand sanitizer, cleaning chemicals, all those, we have been offering those for decades. It's not new, right, it's just -- it's elevated. And we think it will be -- it will maybe not be at the current levels[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ], but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ]it will remain elevated into the near and maybe distant future,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ] or in the near future certainly,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ] and maybe even [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021 ]much further out than that. So that's exciting for us. We see that -- again, our customers now see that much more of a value in it, in large part because people are much more focused on hygiene and cleanliness than they were in the past. And many of our customers, they cleaned for image, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]now they are cleaning for help[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]health[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ]. And that's very much a positive we think for society, but also makes our value proposition that much stronger to our customers. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ] some very positives coming out[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]up[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ].\nGary Bisbee: And if I could just clarify one thing in that response. Scott, you said recurring revenues were flat. Did you mean sequentially versus Q2 or did you mean year-over-year? And if the latter, flat year-over-year, does that imply then that the one-time-ish PP&E sales increase year-over-year was similar to the Uniform Direct sales decrease, which would allow that to be flat? I just want to make sure I understood[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:37:00 2021 ]understand[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:37:00 2021  ] exactly what you're saying.\nScott Farmer: I meant sequentially from the second quarter.\nGary Bisbee: Got it? Okay. All right. I mean, what I'm trying to solve for is, how much the traditional businesses are down. I appreciate everything you're saying about this demand persists in the big uptick [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]uptake and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021  ]in sustainable recurring sanitizer sales, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021  ]in the traditional pre-pandemic business mix, I mean, is that still down 5% and it's offset by PP&E up 5% or directionally, can you help us understand it? What I'm really trying to solve[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ][[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021 ]solve [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:38:00 2021  ]for is what's at risk of going away over 12 months, 18 months, as the traditional business mix obviously comes roaring back.\nScott Farmer: Well, Gary, I think the -- probably the best way to describe it is, as we mentioned, in total for the company, it was up $45 million sequentially. We don't think that will repeat, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021  ]we do believe that these elevated levels, relatively elevated levels are here to stay.\nMike Hansen: Yes, and Gary,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ] the -- to answer what's at risk, we're -- it's really premature. Scott talked a little bit about the enhanced value proposition of all of these things. And while we may see,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:40:00 2021 ] we have seen some ups and downs in terms of that product mix in the last three quarters. We don't expect that to go away overnight. This is not going to be a flip of the switch and the pandemic is over. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:40:00 2021 ] we -- it's hard to say how much of this will continue in the future. Will the frequency of sanitizer spray services stay the same frequency as today? Will this [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:41:00 2021  ]the frequency of our ultra clean services stay the same as today? It's hard to tell. But what we fully expect is that this cleanliness idea and value is going to stick around for a while. And so, so [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:41:00 2021  ]trying to dissect the results by product category and other things, we're not going to get into that,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021  ] because it's too early to tell exactly what that future run rate is going to look like.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. I know you talked to kind of [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021 ]the severe weather holiday impact. Is there any way to think about how much the weather under [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021 ]] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021 ]the holiday and then the spike in COVID impacted the quarter? And I know it kind of varies across business lines, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021  ]just any thoughts as to how that impacted the quarter?\nScott Farmer: Well, I guess, the easiest way to look at it would be that there was a dip from early December into January, and then revenue started to rebound as we got into February. February was better than January. And obviously, if you look at all that,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:58:00 2021 ] the quarter winds up being flat sequentially to the second quarter. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:58:00 2021 ] you can run that down and then dip back up. I would tell you that we do have some momentum as we go into the fourth quarter. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ] we\u2019re -- we have a better expectation of economic conditions and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021  ]in our business as we get into and through the fourth quarter.\nKevin McVeigh: Got it. And then just is there any way to think about kind of across your client base, what percentage maybe you [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021  ]are engaged right now, or [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ]indiscernible[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ]not using [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021  ]product or [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:00:00 2021  ]service versus where it was last quarter and where that's been historically. I know there's probably seasonality there, but I guess just trying to get a sense of how many clients maybe aren't fully active right now, but you expect to start coming back as the economy starts to reopen.\nScott Farmer: So, Kevin, I think your question was what percent of our customers are on hold? So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:00:00 2021 ] we have, we had a -- as Mike mentioned, I believe,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ] a strong run up in the summer and into the fall, [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]some never came back, some of them went on hold. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ] it's a little difficult to give me [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]you [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]an exact number on that. But I can tell you th[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]at[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]his, [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]we're anxious for those folks to get back. We think that there is an incredible amount of pent up demand that is in the marketplace, you had that with stimulus checks, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:02:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:02:00 2021  ]we think consumer spending could spike quite strongly in the Q3, Q4 calendar years -- of the calendar year. And we think that'll be really positive. If you put that together with the strong value proposition that we have increasingly, the strong value proposition that we have with our customers, meaning that when they come back, they still have to provide confidence to their employees and their customers, their clients, that they're coming back to a safe environment. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021 ] we think all that combined is going to make for a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ]quite a good situation.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. Somewhat following up on that last question from Kevin. On [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021 ],[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ]specifically in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ]your airline cruise line hospitality, the travel segment, can you put any quantification on how much those are down,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021 ] and more importantly,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ] maybe just a feel for if you've seen any improvement on those metrics since the trough or [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]? Or [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]if we're still there? And then I will take away from the answer that [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]to [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]last question that, that[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ] is one of the categories that you think in the back half of this calendar year could significantly open up.\nScott Farmer: To begin with, most of those -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]the revenue from those customers is in our direct sale business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]a[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]nd [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]that business is down about 40% over prior year, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]. [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]An[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]d [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]as you analyze that, it's a little different depending on which segment you're talking about. For example, a lot of cruise ships are still at port, so the cruise line business has really been affected. There is some travel happening now,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ] particularly sort of vacation travel. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ] the hotels are doing a little bit better, the airlines are starting to pick up. When I say that, I mean they are [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ]their [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021  ]revenue streams to -- within their own business. We had seen a little bit of improvement from our revenue to those customers. And -- but still down 40% is a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ]pretty significant number, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]I think that the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]those businesses will have some form of recovery as the vaccines continue to roll out and people begin to feel safer travell[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]ing. I haven't been to the vacation spots in Florida, but I understand that the spring break crowd is maybe not as big as normal, but they're down there right now. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ] I think there was a -- as Todd said, a pent up demand for people to be able to go and do things again, vacation again, go get on an [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]airplane and go visit family in a different state across the country, that sort of thing. And I think that the big, the big[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ] trigger for all that and when that all happens is how soon a good portion of the U.S population has a vaccine. How long would [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021  ]will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]it take to get back to pre-COVID? That I don't know, it[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ] might take a couple of years, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021  ]I definitely could see that there would be some improvement in the second half of the year if the pace of vaccines continues at the rate that it is right now.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks for that, Scott. My follow-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021 ]up is, you mentioned earlier it's been 2 [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021  ]two [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021 ]years since any change in pricing as a customer appreciation type strategy. I'm curious, as we move into the next fiscal year, what is -- might we see that start to happen? Would it be only in specific areas that are seemingly overdue and necessary to cover inflation or [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021 ]? Or [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:08:00 2021  ]is that a strategy you'll continue to maintain? What would it take, I guess, is a question for you to start to get a little bit assertive with pricing. Thanks.\nScott Farmer: Scott, thanks for that question. First of all, it's important that you understand that it's not so much that we do it as a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021  ]sort of a favor to the customer, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021  ]from our perspective, we want our customers to survive this pandemic,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021 ] and we were doing all kinds of things to help them out in that regard. They needed to add things,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ] depending on the customer-by-customer basis. But a small business might need to add hand sanitizers and masks and gloves and things from us, but they can't afford all of that. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021 ] we help them with adjustments on their invoices. Maybe their entrance mats[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021 ]match[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ] [ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ]] went from a weekly service to a biweekly or monthly service at a lower rate to help them afford what was happening. And it's [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ]to us, it's the relationship that we have with the[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021 ]a[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ] customer. We believe, we enhanced[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ] their image of us and their opinion of what type of a provider we are during these types[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ] of unfortunate situations. It was similar in the great recession. We had the experience of doing things then as well,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ] and the lifetime value of customers[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ]'s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021  ] we come out of this is significant. They like us, they're willing to -- if they trust us, they're more willing to hear what we have to offer them when we develop new products and services. They're more willing to try those new products and services because of the relationship that we have with them and so forth,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ] and are less likely we think to listen to a competitor's offer, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ]that all goes into what we would use to [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ]and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]make our general calculations about the lifetime value of that customer. So, from a price standpoint, yes, we're coming [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]ind[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]iscernibl[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]e[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]up on[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ] 2 years since we last increased, generally speaking last increased our prices on our recurring revenue,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:13:00 2021 ] and that's particularly in the Rental division where that's probably a stronger statement and more relative to the Rental division than others. But we have seen competitors\u2019[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:13:00 2021 ] typical environment, pricing environment in our business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:13:00 2021 ] and is that when they're trying to take our business, they offer ridiculously low prices to try to get our customers\u2019[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:14:00 2021 ] attention. But the way they treat their customers is that they're willing to raise prices to help protect their -- our competitors bottom line as opposed to help protect the customer. We've seen that in various places in the competitive environment in the last couple of years. We will look at it in the future on a customer-by-customer basis, what type of products and services they need. We -- if we are seeing price increases across the board, we'll have to -- in our own supply chain, we'll have to figure out the right way to pass some of those costs on to our customers. But the fact that we haven't done it in the last couple of years puts us in a pretty darn good position when we sit down to talk to him [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021  ]them[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ]about the fact that it's time for us to have some price adjustments. And generally speaking, I think that those conversations are going to go well. Will that happen in the near future? That I can't tell you. I won't -- I can't tell you yet. A lot of it depends on how economic conditions continue to recover. At[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ] at [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021  ]the pace that we're on right now,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ].[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021  ] I would assume that between that the potential for energy prices to increase, the potential for inflation to increase, we're eventually going to have to adjust our prices and that will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:16:00 2021 ]that'll [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:16:00 2021  ]happen. When? I'm not ready to predict.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A. I would now like to turn the call back over to Paul Adler for closing remarks.\nPaul Adler: Thank you, Katie, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter of fiscal '21 financial results in July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good day.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott. Our fiscal 2021 third quarter revenue was $1.78 billion compared to $1.81 billion in last year's third quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays was flat for the third quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was also flat. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 17.7%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $809.5 million compared to $824.4 million in last year's third quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 10 basis points to 45.6% for the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 45.5% in the third quarter of fiscal '20. This increase was despite one less workday in this year's third quarter compared to last year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.2% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.2% last year. Fiscal '21 third quarter results benefited from increased sales rep productivity and lower discretionary spending. Operating income for the third quarter of fiscal '21 of $326.5 million increased 3.8%. Operating margin increased 100 basis points to 18.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal '20. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was 14.4% compared to 18.9% last year. The tax rate can move from period-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021 ]to-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021 ]period based on discrete events,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:34:00 2021 ] including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal '21 was $258.4 million, an increase of 10.2%. And again, EPS was $2.37, an increase of 9.7% from last year's third quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. During the third quarter of fiscal '21, we purchased $82 million of Cintas' common stock under our buyback programs. Earlier this week,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:35:00 2021  ] on March 15, Cintas paid shareholders $79.5 million in quarterly dividends. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. One more workday will benefit fiscal '21 full revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, the fourth quarter contained 65 workdays. This fiscal year's fourth quarter contains 66. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:36:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:36:00 2021 ]year-over-year and sequential basis. For our fourth quarter, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.83 billion,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:36:00 2021 ] and diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.40. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22.5%. Please note that our guidance does not include any future share buybacks or additional government restrictions on businesses in the event of increasing COVID-19 cases. We are encouraged by vaccinations, stimulus,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:37:00 2021 ] and business reopenings,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:37:00 2021 ] and we expect an improved operating environment in our fourth quarter. We expect recurring revenue to increase solidly on a day adjusted sequential basis in the range of about 1% to 2.5%, after being flat in the third quarter. However, we do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will remain at record levels, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. Please keep in mind these points when comparing our fourth quarter guidance to third quarter results. Our fiscal fourth quarter marks the lapping of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our prior year fourth quarter coincided with a period of greatest GDP decline and job losses resulting from unprecedented restrictions on businesses to help combat the surge of COVID-19 cases. While the pandemic continues, our fourth quarter financial results, including revenue growth will benefit in part from an easier comparison. Our last year's fourth quarter operating income was also significantly affected by many items caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. These included additional reserves on accounts receivable and inventory, severance and asset impairment expenses,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:39:00 2021 ] and lower incentive compensation expense. Excluding these items, last year's fourth quarter operating margin was 15.5%. All these items were recorded in selling and administrative expense. The additional inventory reserves account for slow moving inventory mostly in the Uniform Direct S[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:39:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:39:00 2021  ]ale business, where customers and some of the most severely impacted industries such as airlines and hotels exist. Please keep these points in mind when comparing our fiscal fourth quarter financial guidance to the prior year quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses. Yes. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:57:00 2021 ] from a -- I'll say a short-term, we could certainly see changes in gas prices at the pump. We saw sequentially an increase in our energy percentage of about 10 basis points, and that certainly could contribute over the course of the next year. I think labor is certainly in the news and the conversations about wage rates is likely to have some impact on us as well as our customers. We could see, as you mentioned, certainly in some of the PPE, we have seen quite dramatic changes in prices, in costs to us in terms of gloves and masks and sanitizer over the course of the last year, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021  ]there's probably a little bit of that continued unpredictability in that kind of product. But, Andrew, the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021  ]really good news and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021  ]in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:58:00 2021 ]all of that is we've got great efficiency in our business. And so, many times we're able to offset that with current initiatives that we have within the business. But if we can't, we certainly can look to pricing changes into the future. Todd mentioned, we have not liked that idea. In the last year, we did not think it's the right thing to do. But[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:59:00 2021  ], and it's been 2 years really since we've done it. But if we see inflation peak, that's an opportunity that we will certainly have to consider. And usually in the past, that's allowed us to pass on a good portion of those kind of costs,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:20:00 2021  ] if we can't offset them within our operations. Yes, and Gary,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ] the -- to answer what's at risk, we're -- it's really premature. Scott talked a little bit about the enhanced value proposition of all of these things. And while we may see,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:40:00 2021 ] we have seen some ups and downs in terms of that product mix in the last three quarters. We don't expect that to go away overnight. This is not going to be a flip of the switch and the pandemic is over. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:40:00 2021 ] we -- it's hard to say how much of this will continue in the future. Will the frequency of sanitizer spray services stay the same frequency as today? Will this [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:41:00 2021  ]the frequency of our ultra clean services stay the same as today? It's hard to tell. But what we fully expect is that this cleanliness idea and value is going to stick around for a while. And so, so [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:41:00 2021  ]trying to dissect the results by product category and other things, we're not going to get into that,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:42:00 2021  ] because it's too early to tell exactly what that future run rate is going to look like."

            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic continues,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:13:00 2021 ] and it remains a significant disruption to the economy. Our fiscal third quarter,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:14:00 2021 ] which included the months of December, January,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:14:00 2021 ] and February was particularly challenging. COVID-19 case counts surged from about 180,000 on December 1 to a peak of little over 300,000 on January 8. Not surprisingly, economic indicators reflected an economic recovery that slowed considerably. In December, the U.S. economy posted job losses again after seven straight months of job gains. The operating environment was also challenged by severe winter weather. The snow and ice storm in February caused extensive energy blackouts in the U.S., especially in the state of Texas. Despite a very difficult operating environment in late December and into January, our sales rep productivity remained strong and our employee partners persevered enabling us to offset the headwinds and get to flat on a sequential basis. On top of that, we were able to help our customers with large supplies of personal protective equipment before the end of the quarter. We provided more personal protective equipment than ever, enabling us to exceed our financial expectations. Also, on an organic basis, our quarterly revenue was flat year-over-year, a strong accomplishment considering the comparison to the prior year quarter that was not impacted by COVID-19. Looking ahead to our fourth quarter, we expect lower COVID-19 case counts to be the foundation for improved operating environment. We do not anticipate that personal protective equipment sales will be as strong, so fourth quarter revenue in this product line will decline sequentially. However, we believe that our recurring revenue service -- service revenue will increase solidly on a sequential basis after being flat in the third quarter. Mike will provide more information regarding our fourth quarter guidance soon. Regardless of the operating environment, our employee partners worked with urgency to get businesses ready for the workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021  ]Ready for the Workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021 ]. Companies want to open their doors every day with confidence that they're ready for their employees and their customers. We helped businesses achieve that objective by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance our customers' image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe, and looking their best. For over 90 years, Cintas has accomplished getting businesses ready [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021  ]for the workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021  ]Ready for the Workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021 ] in numerous ways, including providing hygienically clean uniforms to auto manufacturers, for example, so that the workers can safely build their cars; restroom supplies and services to professional services firms so bathrooms are ready for use by employees and clients. Hygienically laundered towels to coffee chains, so B[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:22:00 2021  ]b[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:22:00 2021 ]aristas can serve their coffee lovers, first aid products to restaurants to address the cuts and burns of the kitchen group, and test inspection and repair services of fire extinguishers and alarm systems to facilities' managers to protect employees and customers from danger.

Getting ready for the workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021  ]Ready for the Workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021 ] today also includes taking actions to prevent and reduce transmission of viruses and bacteria.

Hand sanitizer dispensing units to Universities,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:26:00 2021 ] so employees, professors, and students can keep their hands clean. Masks and gloves to city, county, and state governments to protect employees when interacting with the public. And hygienically cleaned isolation gowns to hospitals to safeguard the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:26:00 2021  ]care givers from the contaminants of the sick. Our value proposition of helping businesses get ready for the workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021  ]Ready for the Workday[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:30:00 2021 ] has arguably never been more relevant.

Our partners are honored to be deemed essential. They are ready to listen, ready to offer solutions, ready to solve problems, and ready to be counted on to deliver, and they do. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Mike for commentary on our financial results. Mike? Well, Tim, this is Scott. I'[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021 ]d[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021 ] will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021  ]start by saying that there have been a lot of expenses this year that we have been able to control tightly, discretionary spending, travel, things like that, that impact the P&L. How much of that returns, I'm not sure. I mean, we wanted an awful lot, we don't necessarily have to have the large group meetings where everybody is travel[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021  ]ling into one town to accomplish that. Some of that will happen, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:46:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:47:00 2021  ]a lot of that probably won't. But I'd say that in our sequential -- in our recurring revenue businesses, as the economy continues to, I think, improve, you're going to see us need to add some expense back on to the P&L. That might be growth routes in the rental division as an example. Jobs that would help us with growth, additional salespeople, sales training, additional headcount in t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:47:00 2021 ]he [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021 ]production operations to be able to process things. So, I wouldn't expect a linear improvement, but I would tell you that we do think that we will continue to see 20% to 30% incremental margins,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021  ] as we add the sales line back on to the P&L, and over time I think that we can maintain margins that will be at least at or above, probably above where we work [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021  ]were [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:48:00 2021 ]pre-pandemic, so that's how I would answer that. Does that help you? Okay. Thanks, Tim. Andrew, if I could just add a point of clarification of the $45 million that Todd referred to, that is in the rental segment as well as the First Aid segment. You saw our First Aid segment had another very good quarter at 17.7%. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:53:00 2021 ] we're seeing demand in all of these different kinds of things in -- from all of our customers, and we're doing our best to meet those demands. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:53:00 2021 ] it's -- that $45 million is not all within the rental segment, it's in all of our businesses. Yes. George, but to Mike's point that $45 million was spread out across the -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:54:00 2021  ]all of our divisions, it wasn't just a rental lift, but relative to what happened in Q3, I think it's important that we all keep in mind that our third quarter often is a little less predictable than the rest of our year, and this [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021 ]. This [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021  ]year was as well. It has two holidays in it with Christmas and New Year and our customers sometimes take multiple days off depending on what days[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021 ] those holidays fall on. There's always a potential of weather issues with the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:55:00 2021  ]snow and ice storms and things like that, and both of those things happened this year, and if you combine that with increasing COVID cases, it made it a little bit more complicated than it normally does. I would say as we went into the third quarter, we were very concerned about what we were seeing. COVID cases were on the rise. I've said earlier in my remarks that the economy shed jobs for the first time in s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021 ]even [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021 ]7 months in December. So, December and into January, really even into February, we saw a very difficult economic environment, but as we got into February, we started to see our recurring revenues[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:56:00 2021  ] start to pick back up. Cases were dropping dramatically from -- I want to say, maybe the second week in January, the expected restrictions, the [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]indi[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]c[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021 ]ernible[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021 ]govern[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]ce [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:57:00 2021  ]that we thought were going to put on businesses didn't fully materialize. And so, the -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021  ]we built some momentum in February that we continued[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:58:00 2021 ] to see as we moved into March, and I think that is reflected in the guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter. We're very pleased with our pipeline. Our sales rep productivity continues to be at very, very high levels. We believe that the -- our value proposition is resonating today in the economy more than ever. So we're excited about our opportunities as we look out into the future. Our[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]--[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]T[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021 ]t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:59:00 2021  ]here are 16 million or roughly 16 million businesses in the United States and Canada, and we do business with a million of them. And we really like our opportunity as we approach hopefully the end of this pandemic, and a more normalized economy of our ability to do [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021  ]attract new customers. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] we're -- the pipeline is relatively full,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] and the reps are performing at high levels, even considering the fact that many times they're making sales calls over a virtual Teams [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ]teams [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021  ]call or Zoom call and being successful in doing it. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:00:00 2021 ] we're excited about getting past this pandemic and getting into a normal economy. We think we'll be -- we are well-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:01:00 2021 ]positioned to take advantage of that. Hamzah, that's tough for us to predict. I'm not sure that I'm going to go out and say that we're going to be doing better than we were from a percentage growth standpoint, post-pandemic and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021  ]than [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:02:00 2021 ]we were pre-pandemic. But as I've said, we really like where we're positioned. We've made a lot of investments in the business that we think are beginning to pay off, that allow us to move quicker to be a better supplier to customers. Our customer satisfaction rates that we measure with Net Promoter S[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021  ]cores are at all-time highs, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021  ]we have opened up new segments of opportunity for us. We have new products and services that we can offer to more and more businesses. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:03:00 2021 ] I'll just answer that by saying, we think we're very well-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]positioned, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ]we're excited about the future. Yes. The -- we do think the Fire business has an opportunity to scale up. There are lots and lots and lots of small independent players, there [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ]. There [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021  ]are regional players, there are some PE groups that are doing some regional roll-ups[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ]rollouts[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021  ]. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ] there are opportunities for us to make some acquisitions in that business that would help us ramp up scale and geographic coverage. It is a very good business. One of the things that is important to understand is that different states have different licensing requirements for the level of different reps that we have, service technicians that we've had out there performing different levels of service be it [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021 ]via [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:55:00 2021  ]fire extinguisher repair and replacement versus sprinkler systems and alarm systems. They [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ],[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021  ] they [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021  ]have different certification levels that they have to have. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ] it's different than just hiring somebody off of the street,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ] and us being able to train them to be a First Aid service rep. These people need to get state certifications and licensing and things like that. But that said, we like our ability to grow in the geographies that we're in. There's a lot of geography that we would like to expand into, and there are lots of opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions in the markets that we're in right now. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:56:00 2021 ] we really like that business. And I think over time, we can scale that up to be of size [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]. I always tell the division presidents, including Fire and First Aid, that their job is to figure out how to get their division to be at least a $1 billion in revenue, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021  ]that's what they should be thinking about. And that helps us put goals in place and decide what type of resources we want to invest in the different businesses and so forth, bu[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]t [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:57:00 2021  ]we clearly think that both First Aid and Fire divisions can be over a $1 billion in revenue for us. Yes, Andrew, it's been a -- it certainly has been a different environment operating in the last four quarters, and one that's been pretty unpredictable. I think what we'll see, what we've guided to in the fourth quarter and likely will get us off to a start in the first quarter of '22,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021  ] is the continued reopening of businesses and getting those businesses back to somewhat normalized operations. We were on a nice trajectory of that towards the end of our first quarter of [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]this year and into our second quarter that certainly took a pause, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021  ]we've got a lot of customers that still are either not opened or at limited capacity. And so, I think as we look at the next couple o[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]f [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:00:00 2021 ]quarters, maybe even the most of fiscal '22, it's going to be about fully reopening the economy and getting those -- getting our customers and other businesses back to healthy operating environments. That means we'll take businesses off of held [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021 ]a health [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ]status in the rental division. We'll start this [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ]to service First Aid cabinets again at a greater pace. We'll start to understand the needs,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:01:00 2021  ] when they open and come off of hold, how can we help them in this new type of environment with all of the things that we've talked about that have been important. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 09:02:00 2021 ] I think it's going to be more of that. The reopening of the economy and getting back to some normal type of process than anything else. Well, if we start with CapEx, we're still sort of managing through the unpredictability of the economy. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] we're probably a little more conservative right now and will be in the fourth quarter. But over time, I think our CapEx spend as the economy turns around and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021  ]will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ]get back to a more normalized historical type,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] and that's typically roughly 60% based on growth and 40% on maintenance. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] I think we'll continue to see that type of spend. We do generate a lot of cash. We've got a very strong balance sheet. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:24:00 2021 ] we would be interested in acquisitions in all of our businesses. And then,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:25:00 2021  ] obviously, the dividend is important to our shareholders. We have continued to be in a position where we could increase the dividend to our shareholders every year since we went public, and obviously that is a streak that we'd like to see continue. And then, yes, finally, we do have roughly a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]$1 billion left on our authorization, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]that is more sort of opportunistic from time-to-time as we see opportunities to acquire our own stock. And so, should we be in a position where we're building cash and we think the opportunity is right, I think that the Board would agree that we would be in a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]position to buy back some of our stock. You [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ]W[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]e [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021 ]saw a little bit of that in the third quarter,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:26:00 2021  ] when the stock price went down. And so, it -- I think that I wouldn't be surprised to see that sort of thing in the future. Well, let me start by saying that things like the hand sanitizer and some of the sanitation products and wipes that we have fit into a recurring revenue stream,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ] once we put this like the restroom supplies, once we put the stand out there,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ] we come in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ]an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]d[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]service and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021  ]it [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:28:00 2021 ]on a regular basis, make sure they have enough product in there to make it through till their next delivery and so forth. So that is -- that becomes part of the recurring revenue stream. The other products, things like disposable gloves, disposable face masks,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] and things like that are the one-time PPE sale, I[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] refer to it as one time, but it's more of a direct sale that it can fluctuate up and down depending on customer needs. But we have -- a lot of it depends on geography, it depends on the industry that the customer is in, some distribution-[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021  ]type businesses they've increased headcount, increased number of wares, we -- other businesses have reduced the number of wares. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:29:00 2021 ] it's a little bit all over the board trying to put some parameter on that relative to historical average.[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ],[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021  ] I'd say recurring revenue with the understanding that some of that is now the result of hand sanitizer and that's where it is flat through the quarter. And we think that that revenue is going to pick up as the economy turns around, as our customers get back to being able to open their businesses more fully,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ] bring back some of their headcount, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:30:00 2021  ]I believe that an awful lot of the recurring business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ] like hand sanitizer is here to stay. I have said in the past,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ] and I continue to believe that it's going to be a long time before a typical American walks into a business, walks into a restaurant, a lobby, a movie theate[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021 ]re[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:31:00 2021  ], any place and he isn't looking for a hand sanitizer station after they grabbed the doorknob going in and out of a public building. We're seeing that in stadiums, we're seeing that at -- in hotels that are open, at elevator stations, and that sort of thing[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ].[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ]that's where[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021  ] I think that's going to be here to stay. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021 ] if I'm right about that, as they bring back and open up their operations more fully, that will be revenue,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:32:00 2021  ] as they add people back on revenue on top of where they are right now. I meant sequentially from the second quarter. Well, Gary, I think the -- probably the best way to describe it is, as we mentioned, in total for the company, it was up $45 million sequentially. We don't think that will repeat, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:39:00 2021  ]we do believe that these elevated levels, relatively elevated levels are here to stay. Well, I guess, the easiest way to look at it would be that there was a dip from early December into January, and then revenue started to rebound as we got into February. February was better than January. And obviously, if you look at all that,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:58:00 2021 ] the quarter winds up being flat sequentially to the second quarter. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:58:00 2021 ] you can run that down and then dip back up. I would tell you that we do have some momentum as we go into the fourth quarter. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021 ] we're -- we have a better expectation of economic conditions and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:59:00 2021  ]in our business as we get into and through the fourth quarter. So, Kevin, I think your question was what percent of our customers are on hold? So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:00:00 2021 ] we have, we had a -- as Mike mentioned, I believe,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ] a strong run up in the summer and into the fall, [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]some never came back, some of them went on hold. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ] it's a little difficult to give me [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]you [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]an exact number on that. But I can tell you th[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]at[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021  ]t[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]his, [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:01:00 2021 ]we're anxious for those folks to get back. We think that there is an incredible amount of pent up demand that is in the marketplace, you had that with stimulus checks, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:02:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:02:00 2021  ]we think consumer spending could spike quite strongly in the Q3, Q4 calendar years -- of the calendar year. And we think that'll be really positive. If you put that together with the strong value proposition that we have increasingly, the strong value proposition that we have with our customers, meaning that when they come back, they still have to provide confidence to their employees and their customers, their clients, that they're coming back to a safe environment. And so,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021 ] we think all that combined is going to make for a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:03:00 2021  ]quite a good situation. To begin with, most of those -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]the revenue from those customers is in our direct sale business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]a[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]nd [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]that business is down about 40% over prior year, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021 ]. [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]An[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]d [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:04:00 2021  ]as you analyze that, it's a little different depending on which segment you're talking about. For example, a lot of cruise ships are still at port, so the cruise line business has really been affected. There is some travel happening now,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ] particularly sort of vacation travel. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ] the hotels are doing a little bit better, the airlines are starting to pick up. When I say that, I mean they are [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021 ]their [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:05:00 2021  ]revenue streams to -- within their own business. We had seen a little bit of improvement from our revenue to those customers. And -- but still down 40% is a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ]pretty significant number, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]I think that the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]those businesses will have some form of recovery as the vaccines continue to roll out and people begin to feel safer travell[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021  ]ing. I haven't been to the vacation spots in Florida, but I understand that the spring break crowd is maybe not as big as normal, but they're down there right now. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:06:00 2021 ] I think there was a -- as Todd said, a pent up demand for people to be able to go and do things again, vacation again, go get on an [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]airplane and go visit family in a different state across the country, that sort of thing. And I think that the big, the big[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ] trigger for all that and when that all happens is how soon a good portion of the U.S population has a vaccine. How long would [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021  ]will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]it take to get back to pre-COVID? That I don't know, it[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ] might take a couple of years, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:07:00 2021  ]I definitely could see that there would be some improvement in the second half of the year if the pace of vaccines continues at the rate that it is right now. Scott, thanks for that question. First of all, it's important that you understand that it's not so much that we do it as a [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021  ]sort of a favor to the customer, but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021  ]from our perspective, we want our customers to survive this pandemic,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:09:00 2021 ] and we were doing all kinds of things to help them out in that regard. They needed to add things,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ] depending on the customer-by-customer basis. But a small business might need to add hand sanitizers and masks and gloves and things from us, but they can't afford all of that. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021 ] we help them with adjustments on their invoices. Maybe their entrance mats[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021 ]match[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ] [ph[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ]] went from a weekly service to a biweekly or monthly service at a lower rate to help them afford what was happening. And it's [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ]to us, it's the relationship that we have with the[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021 ]a[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:10:00 2021  ] customer. We believe, we enhanced[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ] their image of us and their opinion of what type of a provider we are during these types[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ] of unfortunate situations. It was similar in the great recession. We had the experience of doing things then as well,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ] and the lifetime value of customers[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021 ]'s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:11:00 2021  ] we come out of this is significant. They like us, they're willing to -- if they trust us, they're more willing to hear what we have to offer them when we develop new products and services. They're more willing to try those new products and services because of the relationship that we have with them and so forth,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ] and are less likely we think to listen to a competitor's offer, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ]that all goes into what we would use to [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ]and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]make our general calculations about the lifetime value of that customer. So, from a price standpoint, yes, we're coming [[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]ind[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]iscernibl[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]e[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]][Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021 ]up on[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:12:00 2021  ] 2 years since we last increased, generally speaking last increased our prices on our recurring revenue,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:13:00 2021 ] and that's particularly in the Rental division where that's probably a stronger statement and more relative to the Rental division than others. But we have seen competitors'[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:13:00 2021 ] typical environment, pricing environment in our business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:13:00 2021 ] and is that when they're trying to take our business, they offer ridiculously low prices to try to get our customers'[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:14:00 2021 ] attention. But the way they treat their customers is that they're willing to raise prices to help protect their -- our competitors bottom line as opposed to help protect the customer. We've seen that in various places in the competitive environment in the last couple of years. We will look at it in the future on a customer-by-customer basis, what type of products and services they need. We -- if we are seeing price increases across the board, we'll have to -- in our own supply chain, we'll have to figure out the right way to pass some of those costs on to our customers. But the fact that we haven't done it in the last couple of years puts us in a pretty darn good position when we sit down to talk to him [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021  ]them[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ]about the fact that it's time for us to have some price adjustments. And generally speaking, I think that those conversations are going to go well. Will that happen in the near future? That I can't tell you. I won't -- I can't tell you yet. A lot of it depends on how economic conditions continue to recover. At[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ] at [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021  ]the pace that we're on right now,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021 ].[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:15:00 2021  ] I would assume that between that the potential for energy prices to increase, the potential for inflation to increase, we're eventually going to have to adjust our prices and that will [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:16:00 2021 ]that'll [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 11:16:00 2021  ]happen. When? I'm not ready to predict."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:40:00 2021  ]care scrubs, mats,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:40:00 2021 ] and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.42 billion compared to $1.45 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin increased 50 basis points to 46.3% for the third quarter compared to 45.8% in last year's third quarter, driven in large part to lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:41:00 2021 ] and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $198.5 million compared to $170.5 million last year. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.5% in the third quarter compared to 48.0% in last year's third quarter. The difference in gross margin is due to revenue mix. In the pandemic, the needs of businesses for personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves has skyrocketed. Even though personal protective equipment is a less predictable revenue stream with lower gross margins than the relatively consistent first aid cabinet service, personal protective equipment is a profitable product line,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:43:00 2021 ] and we continue to work with urgency to fulfill the needs of businesses. Also note that on a sequential basis, First Aid segment gross margins and operating margins have improved through the pandemic. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $160.7 million compared to $192.1 million last year. The Fire business,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:43:00 2021  ] organic revenue increased 3.5%, the Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue growth rate was minus 39.7%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:44:00 2021 ] and gaming customers are largely realized within this business line. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. Andrew, great question. We had -- as was mentioned in the prepared remarks, demand for various items around PP&E and et cetera, other items regarding the pandemic was very strong in Q3. That was a result of what was going on with case counts, and you all saw that. So, that was significant for us to the tune of about $45 million more than in Q2. We don't see that as repeating -- that level repeating in Q4, but But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:51:00 2021  ]we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in business coming back. So, you can see in our sequential improvement, what we see coming in Q4 over Q3, even without that level, that elevated level of those types of products and services. As far as restaurants, et [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:51:00 2021 ]cetera, that's certainly a component of our business. We are encouraged by what we're seeing there with folks'[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 07:52:00 2021  ] activity increasing, consumer spending increasing. We think people having money in their pockets via stimulus will help that, and we sure hope that small business folks who have been incredible about weathering the storm, that their demand starts to pick up even more. So, we're encouraged by what we see. Hamzah, if I could -- this is Todd. Just to [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]expand upon what Scott'[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ]s[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021 ] is [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:04:00 2021  ]saying, the real unknown is what is going to happen with the demand for some of these additional services that we've been able to provide, here's what we know is that demand is going to be higher in the future than it was pre-pandemic. And what's exciting is, many of our customers didn't even realize that we offered[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:50:00 2021 ] those types of products and services in the past. Let me be clear, there's nothing positive that came out of the [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:51:00 2021 ]pandemic, right, but if there is any silver linings, it[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:51:00 2021 ] is the fact that our customers understand more the value that we can provide them, an[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ]d[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ] as [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021  ]Scott mentioned that our NPS scores are reflecting that. And we think that is a -- the more the products and services our customers procure from us, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:52:00 2021  ]the more value we're bringing to them, and we think that is very positive. The other item that I think is important to understand is that we're going on 2 years now without having had a price adjustment to our customers. We have felt very passionate that it was not the appropriate time to adjust pricing when people are going through so much difficulties fighting through [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]for [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]the pandemic. And as a result of that,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ] -- [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]again,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ] our customers had [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]did[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]really appreciated that and truly positioned us well for the future. We look at the lifetime value of a customer and we think it is worth more than a short-term approach, so [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]. So [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]hopefully all that cover [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021  ]co[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]lor [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 08:53:00 2021 ]helps. Andrew, it's Todd. Just to build upon that, everything Mike said is right on target. We're in a good position to withstand those adjustments based upon our model, our efficiencies that we can bring to market. But with all these, whether it's inflation in general,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:20:00 2021  ] or wage inflation specifically, our biggest concern is always the impact to our customers. We will manage our business, we will do it so appropriately. But if it affects our customer base, then that's a much greater concern. And we're hoping that the health of those smaller businesses has been tested, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:21:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:21:00 2021  ]we're in hopes that they can continue to expand and thrive in the new environment. Yes. Toni, this is Todd. We are seeing very nice efficiencies from having beyond for the most part one platform for the entire organization benefiting our customers in one view of Cintas. It's benefiting our locations in [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021  ]and[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021 ] [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:22:00 2021 ]the ability to share inventory, our distribution centers in order to be able to anticipate needs. It's been quite impactful and a lot of positive things that have come out of having that one platform and the efficiencies that come along with it both for the customer, but also internally have been very encouraging. Gary, this is Todd. I think it's important to understand also the vast majority of the products and services we're speaking of, whether it's face shields, gloves, hand sanitizer, cleaning chemicals, all those, we have been offering those for decades. It's not new, right, it's just -- it's elevated. And we think it will be -- it will maybe not be at the current levels[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ], but [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021 ]. But [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ]it will remain elevated into the near and maybe distant future,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ] or in the near future certainly,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021  ] and maybe even [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:33:00 2021 ]much further out than that. So that's exciting for us. We see that -- again, our customers now see that much more of a value in it, in large part because people are much more focused on hygiene and cleanliness than they were in the past. And many of our customers, they cleaned for image, and [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ]. And [Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]now they are cleaning for help[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]health[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ]. And that's very much a positive we think for society, but also makes our value proposition that much stronger to our customers. So,[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ] some very positives coming out[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021  ]up[Author ID1: at Thu Jun 3 10:34:00 2021 ]."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Adler: Thank you, and thank you everyone for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Schneider, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2021. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Scott Farmer.\nScott Farmer: Thank you, Paul and good morning, everyone. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic remains a significant disruption to the economy. In the final month of our fiscal second quarter, November, the COVID-19 virus counts surged from about 100,000 per day at the beginning of the month to about 250,000 per day now. Not surprisingly economic indicators such as jobs growth, unemployment, and retail spending reflect an economic recovery that slowed considerably as the fall months progressed and the virus counts increased. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, I\u2019m pleased with our second quarter financial performance, which exceeded expectations. Our employees, whom we call partners have not wavered in their passion for getting businesses ready for the workday. They're providing essential products and services to help keep our customers and their places of business clean and safe. These include hand sanitizer services, professionally laundered healthcare scrubs and isolation gowns, first aid products, sanitizing wipes, face masks, gloves, and fire protection services as well as many others. The conversion of no programmers, the do-it-yourselfers, if you will, remains robust. Our supply chain and service network enable us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. And our Net Promoter Score, which we use to measure customer satisfaction has risen dramatically to an all-time high. We find ourselves today, however, at a time of increasing uncertainty. A number of states and municipalities have reinstituted temporary economic restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 cases. Others are considering them. On the other hand, vaccines are being distributed and the U.S. government continues to discuss additional economic stimulus. The uncertainty of the resolutions of these impactful events makes providing near-term guidance very difficult. Therefore, we're not providing financial guidance at this time. However, if we're able to gain clarity before the end of the quarter, we'll provide an update in advance of our third quarter earnings release. That said, there is much that does remain certain. Our employee partners reflect the steadfast Cintas culture. They're always striving to exceed the expectations of our customers to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for its shareholders, employee partners, and other stakeholders. The result is consistently strong financial performance with Cintas growing revenue and EPS 49 of the past 51 years. I remain certain of our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. It is never resonated more than it does today. I remain certain of our addressable market, namely the millions upon millions of businesses that are not currently Cintas customers, many of whom are not in a program with recurring service but could benefit from at least one Cintas product or service, and I'm certain that Cintas is well positioned for years to come. Now I'll turn it over to Mike for commentary on the financial results of the quarter. Mike?\nMike Hansen: Thank you, Scott, and good morning. Our fiscal 2021 second quarter revenue was $1.76 billion compared to $1.84 billion in last year\u2019s second quarter. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations or EPS were $2.62, an increase of 15.4% from last year\u2019s second quarter. Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations declined 4.4% for the second quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 3.6%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 14.5%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $819.9 million compared to $852.4 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points to 46.7% for the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.2% in the second quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.1% last year. Fiscal '21 second quarter results benefited from lower discretionary spending and increased sales rep productivity. Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '21 of $352.9 million increased 5.5%. Operating margin was 20.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was 13.3% compared to 20.1% last year. Tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $284.9 million, an increase of 15.7%. EPS was $2.62, an increase of 15.4% from last year\u2019s second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '21, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pre-tax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in the selling and administrative expenses and impacted operating margin by 100 basis points. The pre-tax gain and related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal 20. One more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, each quarter contains 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling on a year-over-year and sequential basis. I'll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. As Scott stated, COVID-19 remains a significant disruption to the economy. Every business in the U.S and Canada has been impacted. Many of our customers that have remained open are not yet operating at the same level of business as before the pandemic started because of the virus has negative impact on health and the economy. Our employee partners continue to work with urgency to offset these headwinds. Over the past couple of quarters, we've provided some examples of their interactions with both new and existing customers to give a better understanding. Many of those examples highlighted customers in the industries of healthcare, education, and state and local government and products and services including scrubs, hand sanitizer service and masks. For the second quarter of the fiscal year, the amount of Uniform Rental and Facility Services new business sold to healthcare, education, and government customers is double the amount in the prior-year period. And the amount of First Aid, Fire, and Other new business sold to customers in healthcare, education, and government is 6x the amount sold in the same period last year. Some of this new business is reoccurring and some may not repeat. Nevertheless, the results are really impressive. Also, the number of scrub dispensing machines installed in our first two quarters doubled last year's number, and since the virus appeared, our employee partners that provided businesses with over 350,000 hand sanitizer dispensers and over 125 million masks. I\u2019m truly in awe of the accomplishments of our team in this challenging time. And I'm excited about the opportunities for Cintas post pandemic which seems to be finally appearing on the horizon. With that, I'll turn now to the second quarter financial performance of our businesses. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care spreads, mats, and towels in the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.41 billion compared to $1.47 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 47.5% for the second quarter, compared to 46.6% in last year's second quarter. Higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefits of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $194.4 million compared to $169.7 million last year. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the second quarter, compared to 48.4% in last year's second quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's second quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks, and gloves. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the all other category. Our Fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $152.1 million compared to $204.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue declined 3.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue declined 51.2%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Good morning, everyone. Could you give us a sense about the month of November in terms of organic revenue trends for rental, and if you can make a comment into the month of December that would be great.\nScott Farmer: Hi, Andrew, this is Scott. Yes, we can give you a little bit more color on that. Through the quarter, we continue to see an improving revenue trend for the month of November, and the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, the rental organic growth was minus 1%. First Aid and Safety for the month of November organic growth was 14%, and Fire continued to improve through the quarter, and it ended November with the month of November down 1%. And it's important to note that about mid November, we did see the impact of some of the state's restrictions on businesses. It -- I would say it affected the trend, but it hadn't turned it worse than it had been at that point. So, it's a little unpredictable on where it goes. But as you can see through the month of November, we continued on a positive trend. I think second quarter revenue sequentially grew about 2.7% over first quarter.\nAndrew Steinerman: Could you make a comment about December?\nScott Farmer: I would say through the first couple of weeks, we were running around where we were in November.\nAndrew Steinerman: Great. Okay. Thanks, Scott.\nScott Farmer: Yes.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.\nSeth Weber: Hey guys, good morning. I had a couple of questions on the margins. I think, I'm just trying to handicap where we're at with expenses coming back online. I think, Mike, I think last quarter you talked about there's about 100 bps, 100 basis points of lower discretionary. Has any of the -- have any of those costs started to come back here in the second quarter, and how should we think about that, kind of through the rest of the year? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Yes, we continue to manage those costs pretty tightly given the environment that we're in. The difference between last year's travel and meetings, which I call out is a 100 basis points in Q1 was about 40 basis points in Q2. Now Q1, we normally travel more as we start our fiscal year, but it was still about a 40-basis-point benefit. And we'll continue to monitor the situation. Certainly, I know that our operational people are itching to get out and see our locations and our customers but given the levels of cases -- COVID cases and the environment, we're going to remain pretty tight on those.\nSeth Weber: Okay. Can you just talk about -- have you seen any relief on the cost side on the First Aid and Safety category? I know there have been some cost pressures there. Have that -- has that kind of loosened up here a little bit with more as weather supplies has gotten a little looser or just easier to get? Just any comments on the First Aid and Safety expense cost side?\nTodd Schneider: Seth, this is Todd. Regarding the First Aid business, certainly there are some PPE type items that are still very challenging to get. We are -- we've been blessed to be in a good inventory position to help our customers out with those items, but PPE is in short supply. It had some impact on cost to us in those cases. But again, we've looked at it with a long lens, and we've invested appropriately, and our customers really appreciate the fact that we've been able to provide products and services, such as PPE and other items to help them get through this challenging time.\nMike Hansen: We do like, Seth, the sequential improvement of gross margin of just about 40% in Q1 to 43% in Q2, and so we're -- we did see some nice performance in our First Aid cabinets in the quarter. And as we talked about at the -- in September, that mix of PPE obviously came down a bit with the growth moving from -- in that segment from over 20% in Q4 to 17% to 14.5% here in Q2. So, we're starting to see some of those PPEs turn into the maintenance mode that we've talked about in the last couple quarters, and that mix change as well as the improving First Aid cabinet has helped that gross margin, and we will -- when we get to a more normalized environment, we certainly believe that those First Aid gross margins are going to trend back towards where we had been pre-COVID. There's nothing structural or no change in the business that would lead us to believe otherwise.\nOperator: We will take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned that in the first several weeks of December, Uniform Rental trends are running around where you were back in November. Can you discuss changes you've seen, if any, around new business and retention trends over the past several weeks?\nScott Farmer: Yes. Our new business numbers continue to perform very well. They -- we still believe that the value proposition that we have is important in this current environment, and so we're continuing to attract new customers. We have seen -- we haven't seen a change in lost business rates at this point. We have seen because of government restrictions, some customers going back on a fold, meaning they're temporarily closing the business until the restrictions are lifted. And that would be the change that we've seen since about mid-November in the economy. Those restrictions are various states and cities, it's California, it's Illinois, it's New York, other states, Washington, Oregon, and even up in Toronto. So, these are the places that we see those type of restrictions that are impacting our customers, but from a lost business standpoint, we haven't seen a real change in lost business rates.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, can you talk a little bit about how much growth you're seeing from the non-programmer market versus your existing customers, and how much health care as a vertical is contributing to growth directly?\nScott Farmer: Sure. The no programmer market for us -- we've tracked it for many years, it's between 60% and 65% of our new business customers. It remains in that range today. And as I said, in my opening remarks, there are millions of businesses out there that do not have a program that we can offer them. And so we like our position and our ability to convert them. Even within the health care space, there are -- if you define a no programmer as somebody who doesn't have a rental program, most of the scrubs that you see in hospitals are direct sale type scrubs, some of them bought by individual health care workers, some by the hospital for departments and things like that. But converting them to a rental program, we would call a conversion of a no programmer. The other area that we're seeing in health care that's doing really well are isolation gowns. Those are traditionally direct sale disposable gowns. And we have a rentable alternative that actually saves the hospitals and health care providers money to convert from a direct sale program to a rental program. So we're seeing a lot of success in that as well. And that would be what we would consider a no programmer conversion within health care.\nTodd Schneider: George, it's Todd. Just to build off a couple of items that Scott mentioned. Our no programmer as a business as a percent of our total, is -- it remains quite consistent. What is changing is, it is allowing us to get audiences to folks customers, prospects that we haven't had in the past in many cases, because of the access we have to critical products and services that they need to provide to their business and within their business to either their customers or to their employees, both so that they can have confidence to come to work and for people to come into their business. Scott spoke about some of the -- in the medical area have been very successful, the isolation gowns, hand sanitizer, sanitizer wipes, disinfectant wipes, scrubs are all -- are -- it's in great demand. Scott mentioned that the isolation gowns were -- that was virtually almost the entire market was a direct purchase, market purchase disposable market, probably the best way to describe it. And what we've done with isolation gowns has been very attractive to our prospects and our customers. It's a green service, right? We're not just throwing in the trash, we're reusing it. It save them significant money. The availability of them, instead of folks struggling to get isolation gowns and being panicked over trying to take care of their patients. What we -- the garments that we\u2019re providing are more comfortable than what they've been wearing in the past. And then lastly, we brought some technology to that business so that we can track exactly how many times those garments have been processed. So we can meet the specifications that are detailed out for such a product. So that's been a big win and a lot of health care customers are very, very interested in that. And we mentioned in our previous earnings release that the demand for scrubs has been up very nicely. People are uncomfortable in many cases wearing those home, washing those at home, and whom they come in contact with on the way home makes people little uncomfortable. So all that has been quite good demand. In those cases we consider those no programmers we might be doing some business with those, those health care organizations, but we're expanding that relationship dramatically.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nMario Cortellacci: Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Appreciate the time. Just -- on touching on the flowing in November and the continuation into December, could you maybe just give us a level deeper in terms of what you're seeing on your end market? I'd imagine it's probably similar to what we saw earlier in the year, excuse me, with the high risk industries being hit a little harder. But is that more or less what you're seeing? Or could you give us some of the puts and takes on some of your end market exposure?\nScott Farmer: Yes. Sure. It boils down to certain industry segments, or geographies. And the segments that you can imagine, the travel, hotels, cruise lines, even in certain areas, restaurants, movie theatres, that type of thing are being hit the hardest, because of these restrictions and people's [technical difficulty] natural fear to go and congregate in a place like a movie theatre. The geographies depend on what type of or if there are any restrictions in place. And what we\u2019ve seen so far is, as we got through the end of November, it's an increase in the number of states and municipalities that have put restrictions in place. We don't know whether that trend is going to continue through the holidays. And just as an example, Governor Newsom in California, put the restrictions in place, they're pretty tight, but he says that they will extend to January the 4th. The question that we have there is, will he extend that further? Which has been his tendency, or will it actually be January the 4th when he starts to loosen those restrictions. So those states are the -- and municipalities are the areas where we've seen the change since about mid-November. And my perspective is that we are in a temporary low, we don't think it's going to be anywhere near what it was in our fourth quarter last year. Quite honestly, at that point, nobody, including governors and people running businesses, at any idea how bad it was going to be, how deep it was going to go and so forth. But now that we've got 8 or 9 months worth of experience in dealing with it, and the fact that we have vaccines beginning to roll out right now, there's light at the end of the tunnel, this is a temporary period of time that we're going to go through. And so, that I hope provides a little color to you. I'm happy to get more specific in any area, if you have any question.\nMario Cortellacci: No, that was helpful. And then going back to health care for a second, just I guess, could you give us a sense of what the competitive landscape looked like there? So I think reasonably one of your competitors came out with a new scrub line. You had mentioned the isolation gowns as being one of your differentiated products, which is, I\u2019m assuming, helping you win business. Just wondering how those conversations are going with customers regarding competition? And then also could you touch on how you're positioning your scrub dispensing system to your advantage?\nScott Farmer: Yes. Todd, you want to take this one, and I'll chime in.\nTodd Schneider: Sure. Okay, great. Mario, I would say in the health care market, it depends upon what area within the health care area, acute, non acute, even frankly into what department you're speaking of. But generally speaking, ISO gowns, scrubs, et cetera, those are direct purchase market, in the case of ISO gown disposable, the most common way people procure those products. Lending companies certainly are in that space, those who provide services to those types of customers. But if I generally describe, it would be -- it's a direct purchase or disposable market with any re-usables would be traditionally with a [indiscernible] companies would be the most common experience. As far as the scrub dispensing, it is -- it's been going extremely well for our business and our customers. The demand is there because it's a -- well, I think most people can kind of see the experience where you go into a grocery store and you see people wearing scrubs, right, and those belong to the hospital normally. And what happens is because both struggled to get access to scrub, they tend to hoard them. And as they hoard them, they have to buy more scrubs and when they do that are in that tough situation, they tend to buy the cheapest scrub they can, because they end up disappearing. And we completely change the value proposition there and we provide a scrub that people want to wear, not just have to wear. Its comfortable, attractive and we're continuing to invest in that area and come out with more better technology around the fabrics, et cetera. And it makes it completely accessible, meaning there's a complete accountability. So when you want a scrub, you can get it, you have complete access, and then it's laundered for you. So they don't have to take it home. So it has been really attractive for our health care customers. And as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we've installed twice the amount of scrubs that we did last year at the same time, so far through Q2. So a great momentum and we're very encouraged.\nScott Farmer: Let me add just -- this is Scott. Let me add one thing relative to the competition. And Todd mentioned that it is traditionally a direct sale items, scrubs and isolation gowns and that sort of thing. And so I think the thing that is helpful to you all to understand is that it is really difficult, and I don't know that it's even a concept that a traditional direct sale competitor would even consider, would be to try and develop a laundry service to do that. So we're providing a unique opportunity for a customer to convert to a rental program where the traditional competition can't, they don't have the ability to do that. And that is a big significant competitive advantage for us versus the traditional supplier that and we believe that because of the technology we brought, the scrub machines, the dispensing units that keep inventory tracking and our ability to control how often a isolation gown is processed before we pull it out of service. These are the kind of things that for traditional competition they can't do. Relative to other rental companies that would be linen companies and uniform rental companies, we've been in this for a long time. We have trained sales people and service providers that specialize in the health care market. And we think we have a multiyear head start on what you would probably consider to be our traditional rental competitor. And we like that position a lot. And I think that's why you're seeing the amount of success for us as we've gone through this process and through the pandemic that we're seeing. So I just thought I'd offer that as some color relative to health care as well.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Scott, if I could just ask you just again from a competitive standpoint, just some broader commentary, I guess outside of health care, like have you seen any changing dynamics that people are getting tight, aggressive, or is it some more consolidation going on? Just curious, any color there?\nScott Farmer: Yes. Let's -- we'll talk competitive, maybe competitive behavior and pricing. We have seen some aggressive pricing in the marketplace. I think that as competition sees their business, existing customer base, have issues and decline in revenue, they typically get aggressive with pricing. I don't think this is anything that we haven't seen in the past relative to low ball prices and competition trying to take business from us. And that's a market by market type of a environment and it could be in any particular market. The small players or one of the big national players in that market that decide they need to do something to try to win some accounts. Relative to overall pricing, though, while we have had to adjust prices on fluctuating items like gloves and face masks and hand sanitizer and the PPE kind of things, as our costs increased trying to get those products we had had to adjust prices upward on those items. For our recurring revenue across all of our businesses really, we have not increased prices during the pandemic and in fact for as a general statement, particularly in the rental division, we haven't increased our price through our customers in about a year and a half. And that's a strategic decision on our part. We don't think that during a global pandemic is the right time to be raising prices. And I think that's one element of why we've seen our Net Promoter Scores, how we measure customer satisfaction be impacted to the positive. And so that's our position on pricing at this point.\nTodd Schneider: Scott, if I may -- Manav, just a couple items on that regarding our approach with our customers. Scott mentioned pricing hasn't, recurring revenue pricing hasn't gone up in 18 months or plus. And our approach to our customers was to be, we call it caring, consistent and flexible. Meaning we know it's a very challenging time for our customer base and our prospect base, so we wanted to take the appropriate approach. Scott mentioned that it's showing up in our customer satisfaction scores, which we track via Net Promoter Scores. And we look at it as what's the lifetime value of those customers. And we want to have those customers for a lifetime, and not take a short-term approach. And I think, again, that's showing up in our Net Promoter Scores, and I think it's going to show for a long-term in how customers look at us.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. That's helpful. And also I think you've given examples on how basically your scale plays totally to your advantage in these time shares those kind of heightened demand. Have you seen, maybe some of your smaller competitors just going to be financially constrained? And is that present even more opportunities now?\nScott Farmer: Well, yes, we -- I always like to say we're an equal opportunity competitor. And if any of our competition in a particular market is having a hard time with either getting supplies, getting the product that they need, having trouble with servicing their customers, we're more than happy to step in and provide those products and services through those customers. From time-to-time, we do see an issue with the competitor, and we will react accordingly in -- on a customer-by-customer, prospect-by-prospect basis, if you will, relative to that. I don't know that it's because of the -- it's still a little uncertain in where this is all going to go and how quickly it's going to end, different opinions on that. But I do think that it could provide a future opportunity for acquisition. I think that there would probably be a desire on the part of a potential seller to try to get their revenue back to where it was pre-COVID to have something larger to sell. But with that we'll deal with those kind of situations as they come up, but that is obviously an opportunity for us as well.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Baird.\nAndrew Wittmann: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I think this one's probably for Mike. And just kind of looking back here on calendar 2020, it's obviously been a remarkable year, challenging year for so many people. I mean the thing that most investors will look back and think about Cintas and how you manage through this and seeing your margin percentage go up despite the revenue is declining. And so, Mike, I guess the question is, we look ahead to really just high levels I'm looking for here, as we're almost about to analyze the COVID comps, if you will, how should we be thinking about the margins? I mean, you guys have articulated the travel [indiscernible] discretionary, 100 basis points last quarter, 40 this quarter of benefit. But other buckets out there that could be margin headwinds as you hit the year and analyze the COVID things, I don\u2019t know things like incentive compensation, fuel prices, other things that might have to come back in, on the production side of things, what else should we be thinking about from a high level as investors that could come back and as we hit the year mark on COVID.\nMike Hansen: Yes, it's been a challenging year. And the -- it is required a lot of different managing of the different costs, cost structures. And it certainly has been a challenge. But as we move forward, look, we -- there are certainly some things that we have learned about some of our costs like travel, and can we do some things more efficiently. And I think there will be permanent savings on some of those things. There will be some of that that comes back. But I don't think we're going to see 100 basis points of movement in something like that. And so as look forward, Andrew, I would say this, we're -- we want to grow over the course of the long-term. We will continue to staff revenue producing positions, to prepare ourselves to grow, and that may mean a little bit more bench in our service departments and in our sales departments. And that will probably create a little bit of additional spending. But having said that, Scott manage the business very, very well in this period of time, and I would expect that that is going to continue. We will continue to be very, very cognizant of our margins and our costs and recognizing that our goal is to continue to see very healthy incremental margins. So, Andrew, I don't there's not really anything that I would point to other than a little bit of that travel coming back, and a little bit more of the staffing of revenue producing positions that are needed for growth.\nAndrew Wittmann: Okay, great. That's my only question for today. Have a good holiday season, guys.\nScott Farmer: Thank you.\nMike Hansen: Thank you.\nScott Farmer: You too.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.\nTim Mulrooney: Yes, good morning. Just one for me as well on employee retention, which I know is a key initiative for the firm and something y'all track pretty closely. I'm curious how that's trended through the pandemic. You get with furloughs and disruptions to your routes, from temporary shutdowns. If employee turnover has been something that's been harder to manage over the last several quarters, or it's actually been easier because the labor market isn't as tight as it's been relative to the last several years. Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Tim, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Employee, what we call partner retention is never easy. But I will say that our performance, since the start of the pandemic, it's has been impressive, results are continuing to improve. We have -- our partner base is an impressive group of folks who are relentless, creative, and very proud of what they're doing on a daily basis to help businesses function in this environment and function successfully. So there's an [indiscernible] in the organization, that they're very proud of what they do. And we've got a great group of leaders and frontline partners all throughout that we're very happy with. And so yes, it's going quite well. And we're really encouraged about that, as we move through. When you go through really hard things, right, and this going through this pandemic has been extremely challenging, not just for ourselves, but for, I'd say, well, you can say the world, right, that it's been very challenging, but it makes you better makes you stronger and we have found out a lot about our partners, and how resilient they are and it's been a real pleasure.\nTim Mulrooney: That's great. Great color Todd. Thank you.\nScott Farmer: Thank you, Tim.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with BFA Securities.\nGary Bisbee: Hey, good morning. First of all, I just wanted to clarify one thing. Todd you said health care, education, government customers, I believe you said new businesses doubled year-over-year but then you said something else up [indiscernible]. What were those numbers? Yes, that right. We are happy to clarify. So both I was thinking of both sectors, excuse me. Two different sectors. One for rental, our rental and facility services business. those sectors, the health care, education and government, new businesses have doubled in that area. And in the case of First Aid, Fire and other, our new business, again, for health care, education, government is up six packs. Now, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, not all that will be repeating, Some will not, but nevertheless, we're really, really encouraged by how well we're doing in those areas of our business.\nGary Bisbee: Can you give us some color on the rest of the end markets you serve? I mean, obviously, those you've been calling out, and it makes sense that you're doing really well. But is the rest of the book down on a new business, or how do we think about sort of total Cintas at this point, including the good and the bad?\nMike Hansen: Yes. So in total, our new business is very good. We're very encouraged by that. The trend lines are great. The productivity is at an all-time high. It's replacing a lot of revenue of customers that are closed. And for those, it's also replacing a lot of revenue for customers who are maybe open, but certainly not at the same levels as what we'd expected in a new more normalized type economy.\nGary Bisbee: Okay. And then just if I could one financial question on cash flow, it's obviously been quite strong. How do you think about two factors. One, CapEx coming back to more normal levels? Is that just a matter of revenue getting back and you\u2019re bringing the spend back or anything else we should think timing. And then the other one on inventory, inventory days is up a lot, I guess, in part sales down, but also building inventory for all these newer items, PP&E and whatnot, how do you think about inventory levels in a more normalized revenue environment at some point in the future? Are they likely to be higher than they've been? And is that something that will continue to build and have an impact on capital. Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Well, let's start with CapEx. I think that we're going to probably see CapEx remain below historical levels until we get through the COVID crisis and the economy recovers. But I'd still say that even today, we're probably spending CapEx at a 60% growth 40% maintenance level. So -- but I just think it's going to be lower until we get through this, everybody is a little more cautious and that sort of thing. Relative to inventory, it's important that I think we make the statement that, that we are doing the best job that we can to manage the supply chain and the supply of these hard to get items with the demand that we're seeing from our customer base. And that's the primary reason you're seeing an increase in this inventory, I don't believe that we're going to see a sudden drop off in the need for these products. I think it'll be a slow, steady decline. And we'll have some view on that as the economy recovers. And as COVID vaccines continue to roll out, many of these are going to be around at a higher level than pre-COVID for a long, long time. And so, we're -- we haven't seen any issues with slow moving inventory at that point, or anything like that. But I will tell you that the fact that we have been able to bring these products into inventory, the way that we have has been a huge competitive advantage for us in the marketplace, where because we might have masks or gloves or hand sanitizer, prospects who ordinarily have not been doing business with us listen to and react to our ability to provide them with these COVID related products. And then also listen to what else we can do for them. And so it might be a call where a company is interested in hand sanitizer, and we wind up after sales rep is out talking to them, where they're putting 10 people in uniform and restroom supplies in the restroom and entrance mats and mops and cleaning chemicals and so forth, in addition to the hand sanitizer. So it's been a big competitive advantage for us as we've gone through this process. And I think one of the reasons why our NPS customer satisfaction scores are up, as well as we're seeing very robust new business results. So I think the balance sheet that we have is allowed us to be able to make that investment. Our supply chain has done a great job in sourcing it. And I think that it's reflected in our ability to sell new accounts and satisfy our customers.\nOperator: Let's take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey, I wonder if you could give us a sense of across the client base, how many are in percentage numbers? Maybe how many are inactive today? And is there a way to think about where the average customer is in terms of percentage of prior peak, just to get a sense of just the potential to scale as things start to reaccelerate from a COVID perspective, we are covering that.\nScott Farmer: That's difficult for us to say, because in many ways, it's a moving target. We have had customers that were open, and then because of a regulation or restriction had to shut down temporarily open back up some of the customers that are open or open only at 50% capacity or at a lower level than they were. But we haven't gotten into those figures because it moves around so much that if I tell you something today, it could be different next week. And so we -- depending on who might apply new restrictions, and so forth. So we haven't gotten into that level of detail. And I hesitate to do that only because I think it might be a little misleading, only because it moves around so much.\nKevin McVeigh: Okay. Thank you. And then just in the kind of post-COVID world, you think about how much of the demand is structural. Is there a way to think about that, again, to the core business, and to me, it seems like, obviously, health care is going to be a more significant contributor to the business, but just any incremental step up and how much of that is kind of structural versus maybe starts to kind of normalize.\nScott Farmer: We've learned a lot as we've gone through this process. And I think that one of the really positive aspects of this whole thing is that we have done a much better job of communicating to existing customers, and even prospects, all of the things that we can do for them. And therefore are selling more to existing customers and a new prospect that might come on board, they may only start with a particular service, but because they're aware of the other things that we have to offer, when they see that need, they know who to call, that has been a structural change for us. And I believe that the things that we have to offer, these customers are things that they're going to be using in the long-term within their businesses to help keep their businesses, their employees, and their customers safe. Have a clean environment for them to work in, be compliant with the regulations and in the Fire business, Insurance company requirements and so forth. So we're excited about the position that we -- that we're in right now. And as I look to the future, I'm really excited about where all this can go.\nTodd Schneider: Kevin, it's Todd. As an example \u2026\nKevin McVeigh: Hey, Todd.\nTodd Schneider: \u2026 that we mentioned that in a previous call that there's a large national bank chain that we were doing zero business with and now we're providing hand sanitizer to every single branch that they have. And we're -- in addition to that, we're talking to them about other facilities products that they are in need of. We're also talking to them about our Fire service, which, as you can imagine they need all that. It's just a matter of where they're getting it from and centralizing spend, in many cases, saving money. So it's just one example of what is occurring hundreds of times every single day out there with our sales and service organization. As Scott mentioned, really positions us well because there's people in the past who really wouldn't take our calls. And now they will because of our inventory position and our infrastructure, and that helps. That helps position us for the long-term in a really healthy manner.\nKevin McVeigh: Makes a ton of sense. I've noticed a lot of dispensers being kind of installed and things like that that just historically weren't there. And that bodes well for the future. So thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. In the Other segment, I'm just curious, how is your visibility there? You're obviously experiencing some new win and seeing some struggles. But if you could break it down on between Fire and Direct Sales, there's a sense of the visibility you have. And this is the essence of the question is, you've done a nice job managing margin there is the -- how does the visibility correspond with your ability to manage your OpEx? Thanks.\nScott Farmer: Well, the Fire service business is recovering similar to the Rental and Facility services segment there. I mentioned earlier, that their November organic growth rate was off 1% from pre COVID levels. But so we have a pretty good view of what's happening in that business. And I think that will -- similar to what happens with the rest of the economy and what we\u2019re -- what happens with the rental division, we'll see that recover in a similar fashion. Relative to the Direct Sale business, a good portion of that business goes into hospitality and travel related areas. That's a little murkier, and I think that -- those are hotels, airlines, cruise ships, casinos and food service and that sort of segment. So those are going to be, I think, the longer tail from a recovery standpoint. But I think that there will be a day coming, where they're going to get a pretty good bump. I think there is a my personal opinion, a huge amount of pent-up demand for people to be able to go back on vacation, to stay in a hotel to feel safe when they get on an airplane and that sort of thing. And there's a point at which when the vaccines have been rolled out to perhaps reach herd immunity. You can see airlines throw in some special rates at travelers to welcome them back, hotels and resorts doing the same kind of thing. I think you can see Las Vegas doing everything that they can to get their customers to come back and who knows that maybe that's early next summer, depending on the rate of vaccinations and things like that. But if it's going to work in those businesses, it's also going to work in other businesses. People are going to be able to go back out to their restaurants and their movie theatres locally, and maybe go to the concert venue and do the social things that bars and do the social things that they're missing right now. And I think that is coming. When it happens, we need a little bit more time to understand the rate of rollout for the vaccines. And that's why I continue to say that we're in a temporary role in this. And as we get a little further out and get a little more clarity, we're going to see, I think, some economic activity pick up and we are maybe a couple of quarters away from that maybe on an improving quarter-by-quarter basis as those vaccines rollout.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks, Scott. I appreciate that color. And just as a follow-up. I\u2019m curious on your appetite for M&A and what you're seeing out there is you\u2019re clearly in a position of power as you\u2019ve kind of discussed over the course of the call. And then maybe $0.02 on the move to the quarterly dividend and just [indiscernible] on the whole return of capital strategy of the [indiscernible]? Thanks. \nScott Farmer: Yes. So relative to the dividend, that -- we were the sort of the last person standing relative to and giving out annual dividends. We thought and have talked about it at a Board level for a long time and made a decision to make the change. I think it's -- we have shareholders that we've heard from in the past about cash flow and that sort of thing. So we -- we've reacted to that. We think it was a good change for us. We think it's a good change for the shareholders as well. And remind me the first part of the question was \u2026\nMike Hansen: M&A, Scott.\nScott Farmer: Oh, M&A. Okay. Thank you, Mike. I'm sorry. You probably dropped off, but M&A, yes. We are cautious right now because of where we are in the recovery. But we are in a position where we could do M&A acquisitions in any of our businesses. We'd evaluate them pretty heavily right now, just to make sure we understand, how well that particular business is doing. But we would be acquisitive, if we could find the right deal the right business at the right price, I think that, as I said earlier, I think there's a -- there is an element of concern on the sellers part, if their revenue is below where it was pre-COVID, that they're going to get out of the business, what they need to get out of the business, should they sell it. And so there may be a little bit of a lull there. But I think as the economy continues to pick up, we'll probably see, M&A activity pick up. And, if that's the case, we sure would like to be a player there.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. I was hoping you could provide some clarification on the operating assets that were sold during the quarter. Trying to understand what those were and was that a cost saving measure, given the uncertainty? And does this reduce future capacity at all? And just how does it impact the run rate margin structure, if at all? Thanks.\nScott Farmer: Yes, yes, sure. It was really just a couple of key focuses, we had some operations in some pretty remote geographies that those particular geographies didn't lend themselves to have an opportunity for a lot of growth. And so we had a lot of resources dedicated to running those operations. And they just -- they just weren't important geographies. For us we also had some services that we had been experimenting with, if you will, that we came to the conclusion that we had better opportunities to grow other segments of the business. So these are the areas that we sold. It wasn't really material. Total revenue run rate was about $50 million annually. So I don't think that it's going to have a -- any short-term, mid-term, long-term impact on our run rate.\nToni Kaplan: That's helpful. And this was asked in a different way already, but just want to make sure I understand the comments that you've made today sound like things are doing fine, improving in many cases, but there have been some new lockdowns and potential for more. So that's your reservation for not providing the 3Q guidance. Just Is that fair and what do you see directionally, I guess, as the range of revenue growth scenarios, is it better than 4Q on the downside, but better than this quarter on the upside, like just trying to understand how you're viewing the range. And obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty. So not trying to nail you down on it, just what's the upside and downside? Thanks.\nScott Farmer: Yes, let me try to explain it this way. We're in a -- I think that it's the timing of our quarter, and therefore this call that are causing part of the problem. There's so much uncertainty right now, as we look out over the next several weeks, a couple of months, few months, maybe. And it's everything from the rising counts of the virus, we have government's putting more restrictions in place. And as of today, I don't know whether more government -- governors and mayors are going to do that, whether they're not going to do that, how long those restrictions are going to stay in place based on the ones that have put these things in place so far. We have a typical period between Christmas and New Year's where traditionally we have a group of customers close down their facilities for the holidays anyway. We don't know this year, whether that means they're going to extend that or not. And so that causes a little bit of cloudiness. We've got an election in Georgia coming up in a few weeks, that will determine what happens in the Senate. And so there's a lot of uncertainty. When we sat down and talked about it, we said, well, let's put a range together. But when we started to put a range together, we started saying, What if this happens? And what if that happens? And those would be things like, what if? What if a governor or a group of governors decided? Well, the vaccine is 3 months away, let's leave these restrictions in place for the next 3 months. What does that do to our ability to predict what our low end of the range might be? What if that doesn't happen? What if Governor Newsom actually does open California's economy backup January 4th. So it became such a wide range that we decided it didn't make sense for you. Our impression of -- and I don't want to, I hope you take this the right way. But our impression is that what one of the things that you like about our company is that we're pretty predictable. And when we give guidance, you can pretty much determine, in your models, what that means relative to what you think is going to happen. In this particular case, we don't think that what we would provide for you would allow you to do that, that you might wind up with some big swings with depending on your positive or negative approach, depending on what you think is going to happen in the economy. And therefore, we decided it didn't make sense for us in this period of time to do that. I do not believe this is my personal opinion, that it will be anything near like what happened in the fourth quarter for us, that was brand new. And I think there were 38 states that put shelter-in-place, orders in place in a short period of time. We haven't seen that. I don't think, I don't expect that that's going to happen at this point. It moving forward, might it maybe my personal opinion is that won't happen. Therefore, I don't see that as the eventual downside of what's going to happen. The upside could be that the number of cases begin to subside, that the mayors and governors begin to open. Their economies back up in anticipation of vaccinated progress, and so forth. But I do know this, with the vaccines rolling out that I can't predict the rate yet, I need a better understanding of what that is going to be. But with those vaccines rolling out, fewer and fewer governments are going to put restrictive orders in place. And eventually those economies and those states and municipalities are going to begin to recover at a pretty good rate. Is that in our fourth quarter? I'd love to see that. Is it next summer, highly likely that by next summer, some point next summer, we're going to be at that position. But that that's my -- that's my view of it, and so I'll end with that.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nScott Farmer: Shlomo, you may be on mute.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Sorry, I\u2019m on mute. Thank you. Thank you for calling that out. I just have a few. It's been great, yes, great color over here. Thank you. And I had a few housekeeping items that I thought we could just kind of run through maybe will be helpful. Just on some of the -- can you give more detail on kind of the one-time sales moving to subscription sales, or is there some way you can just get into a little bit more about how that impact might have happened in the quarter? And kind of the success that you're having over there? Is this something that, it's kind of a little bit more of a permanent lift that's over there. And then a couple more after that.\nTodd Schneider: Shlomo, this is Todd. We mentioned in our most recent quarterly release that, customers when they buy large orders of PPE, whether it's a government school system, could be health care could be -- up and down the street business, but they tend to make a large pie. And then they go into maintenance mode from there. And some of these large fines were in our Q1.\nMike Hansen: There were some in Q2, some or some of those that bought in Q1 are now in maintenance mode and weren't Q2. So it's a real mix and trying to predict for those folks, how long they're going to need those products and services, the access to them is it's a dynamic marketplace. So, again, that's why we're very good, why we, we've invested for our customers in these inventory levels to help them with that. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. And then, Hey, Mike, this is for you, I knew you were really good with numbers, but I'm still trying to figure out how you got an 18 million get dollar gain pre-tax on 108 million shares to be $0.025 of VPS that trigger some other kind of, tax benefit or something with that gain of sale.\nTodd Schneider: It's a great question, Shlomo. It did, yes, the assets had a high tax basis and created while a book gain, a tax loss and so you can kind of think of it as the $18 million pre-tax gain was about a $0.12 benefit. And the tax benefit was about a $0.013 benefit. And maybe said a little bit differently, the 13.3% tax rate was benefited by about 270 basis points. I'm sorry -- 370 basis points from this -- these transactions. And the remainder of that tax rate, call it 17%. Without that benefit, did have some benefit from equity compensation, as we've talked about in the past. As you think about that tax rate moving forward, I would suggest in the third quarter, think about a range of 20% to 21%.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nPaul Adler: Well, thank you, everyone for joining us. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal '21 financial results in late March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning. Our fiscal 2021 second quarter revenue was $1.76 billion compared to $1.84 billion in last year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations or EPS were $2.62, an increase of 15.4% from last year's second quarter. Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations declined 4.4% for the second quarter of fiscal '21. Organic revenue for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment declined 3.6%. Organic revenue for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment increased 14.5%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $819.9 million compared to $852.4 million in last year's second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 50 basis points to 46.7% for the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.2% in the second quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 26.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and 28.1% last year. Fiscal '21 second quarter results benefited from lower discretionary spending and increased sales rep productivity. Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '21 of $352.9 million increased 5.5%. Operating margin was 20.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 18.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was 13.3% compared to 20.1% last year. Tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '21 was $284.9 million, an increase of 15.7%. EPS was $2.62, an increase of 15.4% from last year's second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal '21, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pre-tax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in the selling and administrative expenses and impacted operating margin by 100 basis points. The pre-tax gain and related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6x debt to EBITDA. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there is one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal 20. One more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20, each quarter contains 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling on a year-over-year and sequential basis. I'll now turn the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses. Yes, we continue to manage those costs pretty tightly given the environment that we're in. The difference between last year's travel and meetings, which I call out is a 100 basis points in Q1 was about 40 basis points in Q2. Now Q1, we normally travel more as we start our fiscal year, but it was still about a 40-basis-point benefit. And we'll continue to monitor the situation. Certainly, I know that our operational people are itching to get out and see our locations and our customers but given the levels of cases -- COVID cases and the environment, we're going to remain pretty tight on those. We do like, Seth, the sequential improvement of gross margin of just about 40% in Q1 to 43% in Q2, and so we're -- we did see some nice performance in our First Aid cabinets in the quarter. And as we talked about at the -- in September, that mix of PPE obviously came down a bit with the growth moving from -- in that segment from over 20% in Q4 to 17% to 14.5% here in Q2. So, we're starting to see some of those PPEs turn into the maintenance mode that we've talked about in the last couple quarters, and that mix change as well as the improving First Aid cabinet has helped that gross margin, and we will -- when we get to a more normalized environment, we certainly believe that those First Aid gross margins are going to trend back towards where we had been pre-COVID. There's nothing structural or no change in the business that would lead us to believe otherwise. Yes, it's been a challenging year. And the -- it is required a lot of different managing of the different costs, cost structures. And it certainly has been a challenge. But as we move forward, look, we -- there are certainly some things that we have learned about some of our costs like travel, and can we do some things more efficiently. And I think there will be permanent savings on some of those things. There will be some of that that comes back. But I don't think we're going to see 100 basis points of movement in something like that. And so as look forward, Andrew, I would say this, we're -- we want to grow over the course of the long-term. We will continue to staff revenue producing positions, to prepare ourselves to grow, and that may mean a little bit more bench in our service departments and in our sales departments. And that will probably create a little bit of additional spending. But having said that, Scott manage the business very, very well in this period of time, and I would expect that that is going to continue. We will continue to be very, very cognizant of our margins and our costs and recognizing that our goal is to continue to see very healthy incremental margins. So, Andrew, I don't there's not really anything that I would point to other than a little bit of that travel coming back, and a little bit more of the staffing of revenue producing positions that are needed for growth. Thank you. Yes. So in total, our new business is very good. We're very encouraged by that. The trend lines are great. The productivity is at an all-time high. It's replacing a lot of revenue of customers that are closed. And for those, it's also replacing a lot of revenue for customers who are maybe open, but certainly not at the same levels as what we'd expected in a new more normalized type economy. M&A, Scott. There were some in Q2, some or some of those that bought in Q1 are now in maintenance mode and weren't Q2. So it's a real mix and trying to predict for those folks, how long they're going to need those products and services, the access to them is it's a dynamic marketplace. So, again, that's why we're very good, why we, we've invested for our customers in these inventory levels to help them with that. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color."

            "name": "Scott Farmer",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul and good morning, everyone. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic remains a significant disruption to the economy. In the final month of our fiscal second quarter, November, the COVID-19 virus counts surged from about 100,000 per day at the beginning of the month to about 250,000 per day now. Not surprisingly economic indicators such as jobs growth, unemployment, and retail spending reflect an economic recovery that slowed considerably as the fall months progressed and the virus counts increased. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds, I'm pleased with our second quarter financial performance, which exceeded expectations. Our employees, whom we call partners have not wavered in their passion for getting businesses ready for the workday. They're providing essential products and services to help keep our customers and their places of business clean and safe. These include hand sanitizer services, professionally laundered healthcare scrubs and isolation gowns, first aid products, sanitizing wipes, face masks, gloves, and fire protection services as well as many others. The conversion of no programmers, the do-it-yourselfers, if you will, remains robust. Our supply chain and service network enable us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. And our Net Promoter Score, which we use to measure customer satisfaction has risen dramatically to an all-time high. We find ourselves today, however, at a time of increasing uncertainty. A number of states and municipalities have reinstituted temporary economic restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 cases. Others are considering them. On the other hand, vaccines are being distributed and the U.S. government continues to discuss additional economic stimulus. The uncertainty of the resolutions of these impactful events makes providing near-term guidance very difficult. Therefore, we're not providing financial guidance at this time. However, if we're able to gain clarity before the end of the quarter, we'll provide an update in advance of our third quarter earnings release. That said, there is much that does remain certain. Our employee partners reflect the steadfast Cintas culture. They're always striving to exceed the expectations of our customers to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for its shareholders, employee partners, and other stakeholders. The result is consistently strong financial performance with Cintas growing revenue and EPS 49 of the past 51 years. I remain certain of our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. It is never resonated more than it does today. I remain certain of our addressable market, namely the millions upon millions of businesses that are not currently Cintas customers, many of whom are not in a program with recurring service but could benefit from at least one Cintas product or service, and I'm certain that Cintas is well positioned for years to come. Now I'll turn it over to Mike for commentary on the financial results of the quarter. Mike? Hi, Andrew, this is Scott. Yes, we can give you a little bit more color on that. Through the quarter, we continue to see an improving revenue trend for the month of November, and the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, the rental organic growth was minus 1%. First Aid and Safety for the month of November organic growth was 14%, and Fire continued to improve through the quarter, and it ended November with the month of November down 1%. And it's important to note that about mid November, we did see the impact of some of the state's restrictions on businesses. It -- I would say it affected the trend, but it hadn't turned it worse than it had been at that point. So, it's a little unpredictable on where it goes. But as you can see through the month of November, we continued on a positive trend. I think second quarter revenue sequentially grew about 2.7% over first quarter. I would say through the first couple of weeks, we were running around where we were in November. Yes. Yes. Our new business numbers continue to perform very well. They -- we still believe that the value proposition that we have is important in this current environment, and so we're continuing to attract new customers. We have seen -- we haven't seen a change in lost business rates at this point. We have seen because of government restrictions, some customers going back on a fold, meaning they're temporarily closing the business until the restrictions are lifted. And that would be the change that we've seen since about mid-November in the economy. Those restrictions are various states and cities, it's California, it's Illinois, it's New York, other states, Washington, Oregon, and even up in Toronto. So, these are the places that we see those type of restrictions that are impacting our customers, but from a lost business standpoint, we haven't seen a real change in lost business rates. Sure. The no programmer market for us -- we've tracked it for many years, it's between 60% and 65% of our new business customers. It remains in that range today. And as I said, in my opening remarks, there are millions of businesses out there that do not have a program that we can offer them. And so we like our position and our ability to convert them. Even within the health care space, there are -- if you define a no programmer as somebody who doesn't have a rental program, most of the scrubs that you see in hospitals are direct sale type scrubs, some of them bought by individual health care workers, some by the hospital for departments and things like that. But converting them to a rental program, we would call a conversion of a no programmer. The other area that we're seeing in health care that's doing really well are isolation gowns. Those are traditionally direct sale disposable gowns. And we have a rentable alternative that actually saves the hospitals and health care providers money to convert from a direct sale program to a rental program. So we're seeing a lot of success in that as well. And that would be what we would consider a no programmer conversion within health care. Yes. Sure. It boils down to certain industry segments, or geographies. And the segments that you can imagine, the travel, hotels, cruise lines, even in certain areas, restaurants, movie theatres, that type of thing are being hit the hardest, because of these restrictions and people's [technical difficulty] natural fear to go and congregate in a place like a movie theatre. The geographies depend on what type of or if there are any restrictions in place. And what we've seen so far is, as we got through the end of November, it's an increase in the number of states and municipalities that have put restrictions in place. We don't know whether that trend is going to continue through the holidays. And just as an example, Governor Newsom in California, put the restrictions in place, they're pretty tight, but he says that they will extend to January the 4th. The question that we have there is, will he extend that further? Which has been his tendency, or will it actually be January the 4th when he starts to loosen those restrictions. So those states are the -- and municipalities are the areas where we've seen the change since about mid-November. And my perspective is that we are in a temporary low, we don't think it's going to be anywhere near what it was in our fourth quarter last year. Quite honestly, at that point, nobody, including governors and people running businesses, at any idea how bad it was going to be, how deep it was going to go and so forth. But now that we've got 8 or 9 months worth of experience in dealing with it, and the fact that we have vaccines beginning to roll out right now, there's light at the end of the tunnel, this is a temporary period of time that we're going to go through. And so, that I hope provides a little color to you. I'm happy to get more specific in any area, if you have any question. Yes. Todd, you want to take this one, and I'll chime in. Let me add just -- this is Scott. Let me add one thing relative to the competition. And Todd mentioned that it is traditionally a direct sale items, scrubs and isolation gowns and that sort of thing. And so I think the thing that is helpful to you all to understand is that it is really difficult, and I don't know that it's even a concept that a traditional direct sale competitor would even consider, would be to try and develop a laundry service to do that. So we're providing a unique opportunity for a customer to convert to a rental program where the traditional competition can't, they don't have the ability to do that. And that is a big significant competitive advantage for us versus the traditional supplier that and we believe that because of the technology we brought, the scrub machines, the dispensing units that keep inventory tracking and our ability to control how often a isolation gown is processed before we pull it out of service. These are the kind of things that for traditional competition they can't do. Relative to other rental companies that would be linen companies and uniform rental companies, we've been in this for a long time. We have trained sales people and service providers that specialize in the health care market. And we think we have a multiyear head start on what you would probably consider to be our traditional rental competitor. And we like that position a lot. And I think that's why you're seeing the amount of success for us as we've gone through this process and through the pandemic that we're seeing. So I just thought I'd offer that as some color relative to health care as well. Yes. Let's -- we'll talk competitive, maybe competitive behavior and pricing. We have seen some aggressive pricing in the marketplace. I think that as competition sees their business, existing customer base, have issues and decline in revenue, they typically get aggressive with pricing. I don't think this is anything that we haven't seen in the past relative to low ball prices and competition trying to take business from us. And that's a market by market type of a environment and it could be in any particular market. The small players or one of the big national players in that market that decide they need to do something to try to win some accounts. Relative to overall pricing, though, while we have had to adjust prices on fluctuating items like gloves and face masks and hand sanitizer and the PPE kind of things, as our costs increased trying to get those products we had had to adjust prices upward on those items. For our recurring revenue across all of our businesses really, we have not increased prices during the pandemic and in fact for as a general statement, particularly in the rental division, we haven't increased our price through our customers in about a year and a half. And that's a strategic decision on our part. We don't think that during a global pandemic is the right time to be raising prices. And I think that's one element of why we've seen our Net Promoter Scores, how we measure customer satisfaction be impacted to the positive. And so that's our position on pricing at this point. Well, yes, we -- I always like to say we're an equal opportunity competitor. And if any of our competition in a particular market is having a hard time with either getting supplies, getting the product that they need, having trouble with servicing their customers, we're more than happy to step in and provide those products and services through those customers. From time-to-time, we do see an issue with the competitor, and we will react accordingly in -- on a customer-by-customer, prospect-by-prospect basis, if you will, relative to that. I don't know that it's because of the -- it's still a little uncertain in where this is all going to go and how quickly it's going to end, different opinions on that. But I do think that it could provide a future opportunity for acquisition. I think that there would probably be a desire on the part of a potential seller to try to get their revenue back to where it was pre-COVID to have something larger to sell. But with that we'll deal with those kind of situations as they come up, but that is obviously an opportunity for us as well. Thank you. You too. Thank you, Tim. That's difficult for us to say, because in many ways, it's a moving target. We have had customers that were open, and then because of a regulation or restriction had to shut down temporarily open back up some of the customers that are open or open only at 50% capacity or at a lower level than they were. But we haven't gotten into those figures because it moves around so much that if I tell you something today, it could be different next week. And so we -- depending on who might apply new restrictions, and so forth. So we haven't gotten into that level of detail. And I hesitate to do that only because I think it might be a little misleading, only because it moves around so much. We've learned a lot as we've gone through this process. And I think that one of the really positive aspects of this whole thing is that we have done a much better job of communicating to existing customers, and even prospects, all of the things that we can do for them. And therefore are selling more to existing customers and a new prospect that might come on board, they may only start with a particular service, but because they're aware of the other things that we have to offer, when they see that need, they know who to call, that has been a structural change for us. And I believe that the things that we have to offer, these customers are things that they're going to be using in the long-term within their businesses to help keep their businesses, their employees, and their customers safe. Have a clean environment for them to work in, be compliant with the regulations and in the Fire business, Insurance company requirements and so forth. So we're excited about the position that we -- that we're in right now. And as I look to the future, I'm really excited about where all this can go. Well, the Fire service business is recovering similar to the Rental and Facility services segment there. I mentioned earlier, that their November organic growth rate was off 1% from pre COVID levels. But so we have a pretty good view of what's happening in that business. And I think that will -- similar to what happens with the rest of the economy and what we're -- what happens with the rental division, we'll see that recover in a similar fashion. Relative to the Direct Sale business, a good portion of that business goes into hospitality and travel related areas. That's a little murkier, and I think that -- those are hotels, airlines, cruise ships, casinos and food service and that sort of segment. So those are going to be, I think, the longer tail from a recovery standpoint. But I think that there will be a day coming, where they're going to get a pretty good bump. I think there is a my personal opinion, a huge amount of pent-up demand for people to be able to go back on vacation, to stay in a hotel to feel safe when they get on an airplane and that sort of thing. And there's a point at which when the vaccines have been rolled out to perhaps reach herd immunity. You can see airlines throw in some special rates at travelers to welcome them back, hotels and resorts doing the same kind of thing. I think you can see Las Vegas doing everything that they can to get their customers to come back and who knows that maybe that's early next summer, depending on the rate of vaccinations and things like that. But if it's going to work in those businesses, it's also going to work in other businesses. People are going to be able to go back out to their restaurants and their movie theatres locally, and maybe go to the concert venue and do the social things that bars and do the social things that they're missing right now. And I think that is coming. When it happens, we need a little bit more time to understand the rate of rollout for the vaccines. And that's why I continue to say that we're in a temporary role in this. And as we get a little further out and get a little more clarity, we're going to see, I think, some economic activity pick up and we are maybe a couple of quarters away from that maybe on an improving quarter-by-quarter basis as those vaccines rollout. Yes. So relative to the dividend, that -- we were the sort of the last person standing relative to and giving out annual dividends. We thought and have talked about it at a Board level for a long time and made a decision to make the change. I think it's -- we have shareholders that we've heard from in the past about cash flow and that sort of thing. So we -- we've reacted to that. We think it was a good change for us. We think it's a good change for the shareholders as well. And remind me the first part of the question was ... Oh, M&A. Okay. Thank you, Mike. I'm sorry. You probably dropped off, but M&A, yes. We are cautious right now because of where we are in the recovery. But we are in a position where we could do M&A acquisitions in any of our businesses. We'd evaluate them pretty heavily right now, just to make sure we understand, how well that particular business is doing. But we would be acquisitive, if we could find the right deal the right business at the right price, I think that, as I said earlier, I think there's a -- there is an element of concern on the sellers part, if their revenue is below where it was pre-COVID, that they're going to get out of the business, what they need to get out of the business, should they sell it. And so there may be a little bit of a lull there. But I think as the economy continues to pick up, we'll probably see, M&A activity pick up. And, if that's the case, we sure would like to be a player there. Yes, yes, sure. It was really just a couple of key focuses, we had some operations in some pretty remote geographies that those particular geographies didn't lend themselves to have an opportunity for a lot of growth. And so we had a lot of resources dedicated to running those operations. And they just -- they just weren't important geographies. For us we also had some services that we had been experimenting with, if you will, that we came to the conclusion that we had better opportunities to grow other segments of the business. So these are the areas that we sold. It wasn't really material. Total revenue run rate was about $50 million annually. So I don't think that it's going to have a -- any short-term, mid-term, long-term impact on our run rate. Yes, let me try to explain it this way. We're in a -- I think that it's the timing of our quarter, and therefore this call that are causing part of the problem. There's so much uncertainty right now, as we look out over the next several weeks, a couple of months, few months, maybe. And it's everything from the rising counts of the virus, we have government's putting more restrictions in place. And as of today, I don't know whether more government -- governors and mayors are going to do that, whether they're not going to do that, how long those restrictions are going to stay in place based on the ones that have put these things in place so far. We have a typical period between Christmas and New Year's where traditionally we have a group of customers close down their facilities for the holidays anyway. We don't know this year, whether that means they're going to extend that or not. And so that causes a little bit of cloudiness. We've got an election in Georgia coming up in a few weeks, that will determine what happens in the Senate. And so there's a lot of uncertainty. When we sat down and talked about it, we said, well, let's put a range together. But when we started to put a range together, we started saying, What if this happens? And what if that happens? And those would be things like, what if? What if a governor or a group of governors decided? Well, the vaccine is 3 months away, let's leave these restrictions in place for the next 3 months. What does that do to our ability to predict what our low end of the range might be? What if that doesn't happen? What if Governor Newsom actually does open California's economy backup January 4th. So it became such a wide range that we decided it didn't make sense for you. Our impression of -- and I don't want to, I hope you take this the right way. But our impression is that what one of the things that you like about our company is that we're pretty predictable. And when we give guidance, you can pretty much determine, in your models, what that means relative to what you think is going to happen. In this particular case, we don't think that what we would provide for you would allow you to do that, that you might wind up with some big swings with depending on your positive or negative approach, depending on what you think is going to happen in the economy. And therefore, we decided it didn't make sense for us in this period of time to do that. I do not believe this is my personal opinion, that it will be anything near like what happened in the fourth quarter for us, that was brand new. And I think there were 38 states that put shelter-in-place, orders in place in a short period of time. We haven't seen that. I don't think, I don't expect that that's going to happen at this point. It moving forward, might it maybe my personal opinion is that won't happen. Therefore, I don't see that as the eventual downside of what's going to happen. The upside could be that the number of cases begin to subside, that the mayors and governors begin to open. Their economies back up in anticipation of vaccinated progress, and so forth. But I do know this, with the vaccines rolling out that I can't predict the rate yet, I need a better understanding of what that is going to be. But with those vaccines rolling out, fewer and fewer governments are going to put restrictive orders in place. And eventually those economies and those states and municipalities are going to begin to recover at a pretty good rate. Is that in our fourth quarter? I'd love to see that. Is it next summer, highly likely that by next summer, some point next summer, we're going to be at that position. But that that's my -- that's my view of it, and so I'll end with that. Shlomo, you may be on mute."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. As Scott stated, COVID-19 remains a significant disruption to the economy. Every business in the U.S and Canada has been impacted. Many of our customers that have remained open are not yet operating at the same level of business as before the pandemic started because of the virus has negative impact on health and the economy. Our employee partners continue to work with urgency to offset these headwinds. Over the past couple of quarters, we've provided some examples of their interactions with both new and existing customers to give a better understanding. Many of those examples highlighted customers in the industries of healthcare, education, and state and local government and products and services including scrubs, hand sanitizer service and masks. For the second quarter of the fiscal year, the amount of Uniform Rental and Facility Services new business sold to healthcare, education, and government customers is double the amount in the prior-year period. And the amount of First Aid, Fire, and Other new business sold to customers in healthcare, education, and government is 6x the amount sold in the same period last year. Some of this new business is reoccurring and some may not repeat. Nevertheless, the results are really impressive. Also, the number of scrub dispensing machines installed in our first two quarters doubled last year's number, and since the virus appeared, our employee partners that provided businesses with over 350,000 hand sanitizer dispensers and over 125 million masks. I'm truly in awe of the accomplishments of our team in this challenging time. And I'm excited about the opportunities for Cintas post pandemic which seems to be finally appearing on the horizon. With that, I'll turn now to the second quarter financial performance of our businesses. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, health care spreads, mats, and towels in the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.41 billion compared to $1.47 billion last year. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 47.5% for the second quarter, compared to 46.6% in last year's second quarter. Higher inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefits of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $194.4 million compared to $169.7 million last year. The First Aid segment gross margin was 43.0% in the second quarter, compared to 48.4% in last year's second quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year's second quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks, and gloves. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the all other category. Our Fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $152.1 million compared to $204.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue declined 3.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The Uniform Direct Sale business organic revenue declined 51.2%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions. Seth, this is Todd. Regarding the First Aid business, certainly there are some PPE type items that are still very challenging to get. We are -- we've been blessed to be in a good inventory position to help our customers out with those items, but PPE is in short supply. It had some impact on cost to us in those cases. But again, we've looked at it with a long lens, and we've invested appropriately, and our customers really appreciate the fact that we've been able to provide products and services, such as PPE and other items to help them get through this challenging time. George, it's Todd. Just to build off a couple of items that Scott mentioned. Our no programmer as a business as a percent of our total, is -- it remains quite consistent. What is changing is, it is allowing us to get audiences to folks customers, prospects that we haven't had in the past in many cases, because of the access we have to critical products and services that they need to provide to their business and within their business to either their customers or to their employees, both so that they can have confidence to come to work and for people to come into their business. Scott spoke about some of the -- in the medical area have been very successful, the isolation gowns, hand sanitizer, sanitizer wipes, disinfectant wipes, scrubs are all -- are -- it's in great demand. Scott mentioned that the isolation gowns were -- that was virtually almost the entire market was a direct purchase, market purchase disposable market, probably the best way to describe it. And what we've done with isolation gowns has been very attractive to our prospects and our customers. It's a green service, right? We're not just throwing in the trash, we're reusing it. It save them significant money. The availability of them, instead of folks struggling to get isolation gowns and being panicked over trying to take care of their patients. What we -- the garments that we're providing are more comfortable than what they've been wearing in the past. And then lastly, we brought some technology to that business so that we can track exactly how many times those garments have been processed. So we can meet the specifications that are detailed out for such a product. So that's been a big win and a lot of health care customers are very, very interested in that. And we mentioned in our previous earnings release that the demand for scrubs has been up very nicely. People are uncomfortable in many cases wearing those home, washing those at home, and whom they come in contact with on the way home makes people little uncomfortable. So all that has been quite good demand. In those cases we consider those no programmers we might be doing some business with those, those health care organizations, but we're expanding that relationship dramatically. Sure. Okay, great. Mario, I would say in the health care market, it depends upon what area within the health care area, acute, non acute, even frankly into what department you're speaking of. But generally speaking, ISO gowns, scrubs, et cetera, those are direct purchase market, in the case of ISO gown disposable, the most common way people procure those products. Lending companies certainly are in that space, those who provide services to those types of customers. But if I generally describe, it would be -- it's a direct purchase or disposable market with any re-usables would be traditionally with a [indiscernible] companies would be the most common experience. As far as the scrub dispensing, it is -- it's been going extremely well for our business and our customers. The demand is there because it's a -- well, I think most people can kind of see the experience where you go into a grocery store and you see people wearing scrubs, right, and those belong to the hospital normally. And what happens is because both struggled to get access to scrub, they tend to hoard them. And as they hoard them, they have to buy more scrubs and when they do that are in that tough situation, they tend to buy the cheapest scrub they can, because they end up disappearing. And we completely change the value proposition there and we provide a scrub that people want to wear, not just have to wear. Its comfortable, attractive and we're continuing to invest in that area and come out with more better technology around the fabrics, et cetera. And it makes it completely accessible, meaning there's a complete accountability. So when you want a scrub, you can get it, you have complete access, and then it's laundered for you. So they don't have to take it home. So it has been really attractive for our health care customers. And as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we've installed twice the amount of scrubs that we did last year at the same time, so far through Q2. So a great momentum and we're very encouraged. Scott, if I may -- Manav, just a couple items on that regarding our approach with our customers. Scott mentioned pricing hasn't, recurring revenue pricing hasn't gone up in 18 months or plus. And our approach to our customers was to be, we call it caring, consistent and flexible. Meaning we know it's a very challenging time for our customer base and our prospect base, so we wanted to take the appropriate approach. Scott mentioned that it's showing up in our customer satisfaction scores, which we track via Net Promoter Scores. And we look at it as what's the lifetime value of those customers. And we want to have those customers for a lifetime, and not take a short-term approach. And I think, again, that's showing up in our Net Promoter Scores, and I think it's going to show for a long-term in how customers look at us. Tim, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Employee, what we call partner retention is never easy. But I will say that our performance, since the start of the pandemic, it's has been impressive, results are continuing to improve. We have -- our partner base is an impressive group of folks who are relentless, creative, and very proud of what they're doing on a daily basis to help businesses function in this environment and function successfully. So there's an [indiscernible] in the organization, that they're very proud of what they do. And we've got a great group of leaders and frontline partners all throughout that we're very happy with. And so yes, it's going quite well. And we're really encouraged about that, as we move through. When you go through really hard things, right, and this going through this pandemic has been extremely challenging, not just for ourselves, but for, I'd say, well, you can say the world, right, that it's been very challenging, but it makes you better makes you stronger and we have found out a lot about our partners, and how resilient they are and it's been a real pleasure. Well, let's start with CapEx. I think that we're going to probably see CapEx remain below historical levels until we get through the COVID crisis and the economy recovers. But I'd still say that even today, we're probably spending CapEx at a 60% growth 40% maintenance level. So -- but I just think it's going to be lower until we get through this, everybody is a little more cautious and that sort of thing. Relative to inventory, it's important that I think we make the statement that, that we are doing the best job that we can to manage the supply chain and the supply of these hard to get items with the demand that we're seeing from our customer base. And that's the primary reason you're seeing an increase in this inventory, I don't believe that we're going to see a sudden drop off in the need for these products. I think it'll be a slow, steady decline. And we'll have some view on that as the economy recovers. And as COVID vaccines continue to roll out, many of these are going to be around at a higher level than pre-COVID for a long, long time. And so, we're -- we haven't seen any issues with slow moving inventory at that point, or anything like that. But I will tell you that the fact that we have been able to bring these products into inventory, the way that we have has been a huge competitive advantage for us in the marketplace, where because we might have masks or gloves or hand sanitizer, prospects who ordinarily have not been doing business with us listen to and react to our ability to provide them with these COVID related products. And then also listen to what else we can do for them. And so it might be a call where a company is interested in hand sanitizer, and we wind up after sales rep is out talking to them, where they're putting 10 people in uniform and restroom supplies in the restroom and entrance mats and mops and cleaning chemicals and so forth, in addition to the hand sanitizer. So it's been a big competitive advantage for us as we've gone through this process. And I think one of the reasons why our NPS customer satisfaction scores are up, as well as we're seeing very robust new business results. So I think the balance sheet that we have is allowed us to be able to make that investment. Our supply chain has done a great job in sourcing it. And I think that it's reflected in our ability to sell new accounts and satisfy our customers. Kevin, it's Todd. As an example ... ... that we mentioned that in a previous call that there's a large national bank chain that we were doing zero business with and now we're providing hand sanitizer to every single branch that they have. And we're -- in addition to that, we're talking to them about other facilities products that they are in need of. We're also talking to them about our Fire service, which, as you can imagine they need all that. It's just a matter of where they're getting it from and centralizing spend, in many cases, saving money. So it's just one example of what is occurring hundreds of times every single day out there with our sales and service organization. As Scott mentioned, really positions us well because there's people in the past who really wouldn't take our calls. And now they will because of our inventory position and our infrastructure, and that helps. That helps position us for the long-term in a really healthy manner. Thank you. Shlomo, this is Todd. We mentioned in our most recent quarterly release that, customers when they buy large orders of PPE, whether it's a government school system, could be health care could be -- up and down the street business, but they tend to make a large pie. And then they go into maintenance mode from there. And some of these large fines were in our Q1. It's a great question, Shlomo. It did, yes, the assets had a high tax basis and created while a book gain, a tax loss and so you can kind of think of it as the $18 million pre-tax gain was about a $0.12 benefit. And the tax benefit was about a $0.013 benefit. And maybe said a little bit differently, the 13.3% tax rate was benefited by about 270 basis points. I'm sorry -- 370 basis points from this -- these transactions. And the remainder of that tax rate, call it 17%. Without that benefit, did have some benefit from equity compensation, as we've talked about in the past. As you think about that tax rate moving forward, I would suggest in the third quarter, think about a range of 20% to 21%."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaul Adler: Thanks, April, and good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today is Scott Farmer, Cintas Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Schneider, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

This continues to be a challenging time for our employees, who we call partners, are doing all they can do to keep our customers\u2019 places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday. Our employee partners have remained diligent in their care of our customers providing essential products and services. And they remain diligent in their care of each other, and we can't thank them enough for their truly impressive achievements. Before we get into the financial results, I'd like to provide you with some examples of our interactions with our customers in the first quarter of our fiscal year, so you will have a better understanding of our business. A hospital system in Michigan provided isolation gowns to their staff and laundered them in the hospital. These garments are fluid resistant protective clothing worn by doctors and nurses. The hospital had difficulty staffing the laundry and suffered quality issues. The hospital system, a no programmer as we call it, decided to outsource the procurement and laundering to Cintas so they could concentrate on patient care. Another no programmer, a dental alliance with 55 locations in three states, signed with us for scrubs in a rental program for 550 wearers. Due to their satisfaction with the service, they're in discussions with us to add facility services products and first aid supplies. In California, one university system with many campuses signed a multi-year agreement for hand sanitizer service. In addition, our first aid business is providing them with $0.5 million of hard to find gloves. To another university system in California, our first aid division is providing over a million facemasks. A restaurant chain that has been a customer since 2007 had been struggling in the first few months of the pandemic. In talking with the customer, we listened and were empathetic and adjusted service frequencies and inventories in partnership with them. They were so pleased with the way that we treated them that they renewed our service agreement and added hand sanitizer stand service to every one of the restaurants. A casino customer in Ohio recently reopened after being dormant due to COVID-19 restrictions. In order to conduct business in the new environment, casino added rental mask services and additional items to increase cleaning protocols including dusk mats and microfiber mops, and towels. And a city government in Texas was a no programmer until they came to us for a hand sanitizer program for all of their government buildings. They were so happy with the execution that we gained their trust to provide some of their Personal Protective Equipment needs as well. They were impressed with our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of masks within days. These examples are just a handful of the many and were offered to highlight the following; our opportunity to convert no programmers, the do-it yourselfers remains robust; scrubs and isolation gowns are indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Our approach is being flexible with customers in the short term reach, long-term benefits. Our Net Promoter Scores, which we use to measure customer satisfaction has never been higher. Earning the trust of the customer enables us to penetrate -- enables further penetration and cross selling, and our supply chain and service network, our competitive advantages, enabling us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. Our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance has never resonated more than it does today. A new trend of greater focus on health, readiness, and outsourcing of non-core activities is under way. We are well positioned for this new normal. I'll turn the call over to Mike now for commentary on the financial results. Mike?\nMike Hansen: Thanks, Scott and good morning. Our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. Free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for this year's first quarter, was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6%. Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays, declined 5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic revenue for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment declined 5.4%. Organic revenue for the first aid and safety services\u2019 operating segment increased 17.1%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $826.2 million decreased 2.7%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue 47.3% for the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.3% in the first quarter and 30% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal \u201821 first quarter results benefited from lower expenses as a percentage of revenue in many areas, including discretionary spending. Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $349.7 million increased 14.2%. Operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Our fiscal first quarter contained one more workday than the prior year first quarter. One more workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense, and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was 7.8% compared to 10.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was $300 million, an increase of 19.6%. Earnings per diluted share were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow. First quarter free cash flow was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6% compared to last year. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6 times debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there will be one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. One more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating income margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20 each quarter contained 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, we would like to provide our second quarter financial expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.75 billion and EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. Please note the following regarding second quarter financial expectations. Our second quarter contains the same number of workdays as last year's second quarter, but one less than our first quarter. We expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 17.5% to 19%. And we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be about 22% compared to 20.1% in last year's second quarter. I'll now turn it over to Todd.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. Mike. Before I review the business results, I'd like to build off with Scott's comments. While the environment remains challenging and uncertain, we did experienced a continued improvement in results through the quarter. The majority of our existing customers have reopening and our employee partners work diligently in partnership with these businesses to get them ready for the work day. Despite reopening, many existing customers are not yet operating at the same level of business before the COVID-19 pandemic started, because of the virus\u2019s impact on health and the economy. In keeping with the Cintas culture, our employee partners are working with urgency to offset these headwinds. Significant opportunities for new revenues exists because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. Additionally, businesses are outsourcing tasks that are not their core competency, so they can successfully navigate these challenging times. The value we provide businesses has never been more evident. In fact, we've been given a seat at the table in discussions with state and local officials, hospital administrations, COVID-19 procurement task forces and hospitality cleanliness counsels. There is greater demand for services and products we already provide such as health [Technical difficulty] in other areas, demand is so attractive that we are providing new services and products made possible by our supply chain, distribution network, sales force and cash flow. These include rental healthcare isolation gowns, hand sanitizer stand dispenser service and sanitizing spray service. With that, I'll turn now to the first quarter financial performance of our business. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, healthcare scrubs, masks and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs for our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.39 billion, a decrease of 4.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic revenue declined 5.4%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 48.7% for the first quarter compared to 47.2% in last year's first quarter. Prior inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefit of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue, the additional workday and lower energy expenses. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $204.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 17.1%. The first aid segment gross margin was 40.2% in the first quarter compared to 49% in last year's first quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year first quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. Our Fire Protection Services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other categories. Our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. Uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low-single-digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform direct sale, however, is a key business for us and as customers are offered significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $147.7 million, a decrease of 20%. Organic revenue declined 22.2%. The fire business organic revenue declined 5.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The uniform direct sale business organic revenue declined 47.3%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And we'll first hear from Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets.\nSeth Weber: I had a couple questions on the first aid safety business. I guess, maybe Mike, can you just talk to how -- do you feel like you're still seeing large one-time sales in that category or do you feel like that this is, that the growth rate there has been a reset to a higher level kind of on a sustainable basis? And then on a follow up question, can you just talk, give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the supply chain on the cost side? I think Todd called out some higher COGS for some PPE. Is that -- do you think just a temporary issue or will that -- is that sort of the new normal just on the cost side? Thank you.\nScott Farmer: Seth, this is Scott. I'll take the first part of that. I\u2019ll let Todd take the second part of that. On first aid and safety, I think the way that is probably the best way for you all to look at it is that a lot of the initial upfront large sales of PPE through the first aid business are similar to what happens in the direct sales business. When we sell a big new customer, there's a large upfront sale of these goods and then it will -- that customer's revenue will drop to a maintenance level. And so, we are seeing that in the first quarter we did have a lot of large upfront sales to customers in the first aid and safety business that are now moving into that maintenance level. That doesn't mean that there aren\u2019t other customers out there that we can find and identify, but I think that there was a big rush of that in our first quarter as pandemic hit, and so I would say we're probably closer in the second quarter to move it more into the maintenance mode on those type of things. I would say that probably means that we may not drill in the high-teens in the first aid and safety, but we will continue to see very good growth in first aid and safety.\nTodd Schneider: We kind of end up in a large first order and then there is some maintenance mode there, but we're really focused on taking care of our customers. They are -- and there\u2019s great demand for some of these products out there, gloves, masks, hand sanitizers et cetera. So, we're blessed to be in a good position in the inventory and be able to take care of them, but we are encouraged still that we're selling a lot of first aid cabinets that's going well, and we think things will moderate in growth, probably we're also anxious to see the COGS to moderate back to closer to where it was before.\nSeth Weber: And have you seen any pickup in the cabinet business Todd? I know last quarter you talked about is sort of [Technical Difficulty]\u2026 \nTodd Schneider: Seth, you sound a bit muffled. Can you start that question over please?\nSeth Weber: I was just wondering if you\u2019ve seen a pickup in the cabinet business. I know last quarter you talked about that you're having challenges getting into facilities and things like that. Has that -- has the cabinet side of the business picked up as well?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, our new cabinet sales are going quite well, but we have a heck of a lot of customers that are still on the sidelines. They're close. So that's certainly affecting what is being procured through our cabinets, and we're anxious for those businesses to get back up and running. But long-term, while we pivoted helping our customers and long-term we're quite bullish on the direction of the organization.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from George Tong of Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You talked about healthy growth for scrubs and isolation gowns in the healthcare vertical, both among existing customers and in the no programmer market. At this point, what percentage of revenue is being generated by healthcare customers and how quickly is this vertical growing?\nScott Farmer: Hi, George. This is Scott. When we talk about revenue in the healthcare segment, keep in mind that we're talking about all the products and services that we would provide to the healthcare segment that is both fire service, first aid service, some direct sales business, and obviously some rental -- uniform rental and FS business. It represents about 7% of our total revenue now. We're excited about what we see in that segment. Healthcare represents about 17% of GDP. And so we think we continue to have a big opportunity in healthcare. The scrub rental business and these isolation gowns -- from your perspective if you just simply refer to those as the scrub business, I think you'd be safe. These isolation gowns are things typically worn over the top of the scrub, dealing with particular patients to protect the nurse or doctor from bodily fluids and things like that that. No need to get into a whole separate category on that. But we're excited on what we see there. The COVID has brought a realization to healthcare providers that taking -- wearing scrubs to work and then wearing them home may not be the right approach, and they're looking for ways to outsource managing those programs for them and we really like the position that we're in. I would say that healthcare has a great opportunity to be the first segment that we service to grow to over 10% of our total revenue. And so, we remain very optimistic about this segment.\nGeorge Tong: And as revenues begin to recover over the near to intermediate term, can you provide some perspective on what you expect for incremental margin flow through, particularly as operating leverage begins to kick in and you start to see utilization and capacity rates recover?\nMike Hansen: Yeah. I think, George, from an incremental margin perspective, we talked a lot about in the past, we like incremental operating margins to be in the 20% to 30% range. Clearly, we've exceeded that in this first quarter. But that's the -- longer term, that still is the range that we like to see, because it really keeps us in a cadence where we are growing in the way that we want to grow and we are managing the number of sales people that we need and the number of routes that we need, the amount of capacity that we need, and when we are growing the way we want to grow, we actually like that 20% to 30% range and expect that that will continue as we get out of this really disruptive and bumpy period.\nOperator: Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: My first question is maybe for Scott. I know you've touched on some examples of net new business sort of in your prepared remarks. But maybe if you could just talk about how the sales cycle today compares to pre-COVID in converting some of these customers? I assume healthcare has accelerated given to some of your comments, maybe even food service. But maybe if you could just talk about how that cycle defers today versus pre-COVID. It seems like it's accelerated. I think you touched on outsourcing potentially accelerating coming out of this period?\nScott Farmer: Yeah, happy to provide a little color there and Todd may want to chime in as we go through this. But the pre-COVID we had decision makers that had time to review things, try to get multiple competitive looks and things like that when we're out in the marketplace. I think that the urgency of trying to find certain products and services certainly shortened that sales cycle, decisions were made more quickly. It's not to say that they weren't trying to find competitive bids. But in many cases, it was hard for competitors to come up with the products and services they needed to fulfill a customer's order. I'm proud to say that we did a really good job of making sure that we were in front of that and had inventory. And so we've been reasonably successful in being able to help these companies out. As we look at sales productivity amongst our sales force we have been through the entire COVID period, selling at very impressive productivity rates, very high historically. We'd like to see that happen. We think it's a good sign for the foreseeable future for the company. And so you combine that sales productivity with decision makers that are in the market, trying to make reasonably quick decisions and we think we can do very well in that regard. Todd, I don\u2019t know you have anything to add?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. It's good question. It really varies dramatically based upon whom you're calling on, the products you're selling. Our sales organization is highly urgent anyway and highly adaptable. And I've been really impressed by how they\u2019ve been able to overcome any obstacles that were -- it seems like came in their way. But we have products and services that people really need to -- I'll say instill confidence in their employees, in their guests, in their customers, how you want to describe their students, their patients. When you have those available, it does shorten the sales cycle, because there is some times where we walk in and they say, my goodness, you have that, let's go. And so, again, there's so many different sales processes going on at any one time. It\u2019s tough to say, make a sweeping statement. But just generally speaking, yeah, it set it up because of the urgency of making sure people are taken care of. And we are again blessed to be in a good spot with it products and services, and that creates confidence in our people, in our customers and showing in the productivity.\nHamzah Mazari: Great. And then just my follow-up question is just on the hygiene business. Could you maybe talk about the outlook there but particularly, what is your value proposition in hygiene versus some larger competitors that maybe moved into that market first? I know your product looks nicer than Ecolab from the outside -- but hand sanitizers and such. But maybe just give us a sense of the value prop you have in that business, because it seems like a newer business for you even pre-COVID obviously is accelerated today.\nTodd Schneider: Hamzah, I'll start then Scott can feel free to jump in. And we appreciate your comment on our products. We invest a heck of a lot into our R&D to make sure that we have really attractive functional products, a lot of investment in it. And we have been in the hygiene business for I'll call it decades, right? It\u2019s just we spoke in our last call about how 9/11, September 11, 2001 had a dynamic impact on security and we believe that this pandemic is going to have a similar effect on hygiene in our world, and that has been something that's been positive for our business. So our customers love the fact that we have availability. We have attractive products. We have a great inventory distribution system. Very fair approach to how we handle things. And we have a great suite of products and services that are right there on the truck. They can deal with one organization that can handle all their needs we\u2019re able to -- because the vast majority of our routes service our customers weekly and allow for us to be able to inspect what they have, where they are from an inventory standpoint and help provide some consultative services instead of just tell us when you need some more product. So that route infrastructure and obviously, distribution center system is a real strategic advantage for us moving forward.\nScott Farmer: And I'd say it this way just to echo what Todd said. What we do that most of our competitors who have been in this space for some period of time don't do is that we're there every week so we make sure that they always have inventory and they never run out. Most of the time, a customer who's buying it from a supply house or a traditional competitor has to take it upon themselves to realize that they're running low on inventory, sometimes that happens when they're out of inventory then they have to go and place the order, they have to wait for the order to come to them. They're out of supply for maybe a few days and that sort of thing. And they don't have to worry about that when we're taking care of it for them. And restrooms are something that every single business has to deal with. And when we take care of that for them, it's one less detail that they have to worry about in the course of their business day and allows them to focus their time and attention on taking care of their customers. So I think that's the value proposition that we're offering in the hygiene business.\nOperator: Manav Patnaik of Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: My first question is, clearly you guys are winning a lot of new mandates there. And in the past, you talked about how non-programmers, really kind of two thirds of the new sales. Is that tilt, is that still [persisting] more now, because as it's the COVID driven demand? And is it -- I assume competition get the same kind of list as well, or is there an element that you guys just winning some of that new share as well, if that\u2019s [high] at the table?\nMike Hansen: So Manav, I think you're asking is there -- we talked about new business, about 60% of our new business coming from new programmers, and is that the case as we sit here in this disruptive period and are we seeing any differences in the way that our competitors are coming to market and competing. And I'll start, as Todd mentioned earlier, our new business continues to be very, very robust. And we're selling not just the same mix of product from six months ago but a little bit of a different mix as it relates to this hygiene messaging, which is resonating so well. And so that certainly can lead to new types of prospects that we may not have talked to in the past. And when we get our foot in the door good things can happen. When they start to see our service, we can continue to talk about other needs that they may have. And so we've seen some nice success in that during this -- even during the fourth quarter but more so in this first quarter.\nTodd Schneider: Frankly, that was part of the question of the sales cycle. The sales cycle is certainly a big setup just because we all saw more no programmers. There is no hurdle it hit over to sale something they can buy immediately and that can be a positive for us. As Mike mentioned, if we're selling into different -- a variety of different prospects and we're also, because of the urgency and the intensity of what we're -- what is important to these businesses, we're going to get at levels of decision makers that we weren't in the past quicker. So that again speak things up. When decision makers hear our value proposition it resonates. And so there is certainly don't -- pandemic has been absolutely horrible for the country, the world, it\u2019s been major for our customers. But if there is some shining light it's bringing more focus to the products and services that we have and the value that we provide and getting us an audience at high levels and quicker.\nManav Patnaik: Okay, that makes sense. And in terms of at least the examples we\u2019ve provided, it sounds like there\u2019s lot of large institutions that are coming to you guys for the offerings, but maybe just on the flip side. Can you just talk about your kind of small business customers and adding just kind of in survival mode? Do you anticipate risk further down the road of getting on the lockdown that they can even survive? Just any color there would be appreciated.\nScott Farmer: Obviously, that depends on geography, industry segment and that sort of thing. It's different in each one, because of various local governments or state governments that have put restrictions in place. I\u2019d say generally speaking the small customers that are open right now are weathering this -- as a general statement, pretty darn well. I think it says a lot about the American entrepreneurial spirit to see them, able to do the things that they're doing with the new rules in place, be they face masks and outdoor dining and such. But some of them -- many of them are not at full capacity yet because of various restrictions that have been put on them, or customers that may not be ready to come back out to frequent their businesses. So clearly, I think for the American economy, for the global economy, a vaccine is going to be very well received so that the rules can change and businesses can get back to operating under a sort of a new normal but a normal that allows them to operate in a more traditional fashion.\nOperator: Andy Wittmann with Baird.\nAndy Wittmann: I have a question and then a follow-up question. I mean clearly here in the quarter you saw quarter-over-quarter acceleration in the organic trends and talking about the rental segment, I guess, in particular. And I'm just curious if you could give a little bit more detail on your customers and look at the guidance for next quarter kind of suggest that revenues will be down 5% or 6% year-over-year and that's not too dissimilar from what you saw here in the quarter. So how has the month over month trends progressed in comparison to what the implied revenue outlook is? And just any color that you have in terms of your visibility in this and how you chose to select this range with all the uncertainties, conservative or other factors that are baked into the revenue guidance?\nTodd Schneider: Certainly, this has been an unusual environment right? There was 22 million jobs that were lost, it seemed like overnight almost and then jobs returned pretty quickly in the early, very early portion of the summer. And then as you've seen that the summer we're on things moderated a bit and jobs returning and so 11 million people that are -- 11 million jobs that have not been recovered. So that has certainly impacted our business. So we need more businesses to come back. We are still guiding towards sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. We do have one less workday in Q2 versus Q1. And we're encouraged by our new business efforts, the products and services that we're selling, the engagement of our customers of what we're providing. But it takes a while for all those new business efforts to recover over all the businesses that are still closed and all the jobs that are still on the sidelines. But we're very much looking forward to Q2, Q3, Q4 and we like the trend line to work that we're seeing.\nMike Hansen: And maybe I'll offer a couple points. One is Scott talk a little earlier about the first aid and safety, large personal protective equipment sales there that kind of turned into maintenance a little bit. So keep that in mind. Another point I'll make is if you think about the first quarter revenue on the same workdays as Q2, you're talking about 1.720 billion. And so we do see some -- that guidance range especially at the top of it does look too nice sequential improvement. And keep in mind -- the last point I'll make is last year's second quarter was a pretty good quarter for us as well. And so when you put it all together echoing what Todd said, we remain excited about the performance and the momentum that we have, particularly in a bit of a challenging environment and one that still contains a fair amount of I'll say lack of clarity, let\u2019s say. And so we think this guidance range really points to continued nice momentum improvement.\nAndy Wittmann: Thanks, Mike for that, that's good perspective. I want to also kind of ask on the cost side here. Anytime you've got basically EBITDA up against declining revenue that's again, a very surprising and very good outcome for the company. We're already starting to see some questions from some of our customers asking if there was anything one-time, either positively or negatively. In other words, costs that maybe were furloughed or otherwise, things like that that were recognized in the quarter that need to creep back in here as the year progresses or other things, if you continue to do some level of restructuring, certainly that was a big factor in your fourth quarter. It sounded like you had it mostly contained in the fourth quarter, but maybe there was some carry over in the first quarter. But, Mike, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes inside the margins and the implications about incremental margins over a hundred percents here on a go forward basis and what's unusual about the quarter, if anything.\nMike Hansen: Sure. I'll start that. I wouldn't call out any specific one-time items. But as you think about this period of time that we're in, we entered the quarter with a fair amount of disruption and lack of clarity. And we entered it with a hiring freeze, a wage rate freeze and pretty tight control on discretionary spending. And as the quarter went on, revenue obviously came a bit higher than our guidance range and we've been pleased with that. And so we started to bring -- we started hire back revenue producing positions and that certainly will have an impact as we move forward. But in the first quarter in this period of just extreme disruption, we entered it with a lot of uncertainty and we exited with still some uncertainty, but better momentum than we certainly expected. I'll point to a couple of things though within the quarter. Energy was 30 basis points better than a year ago. So we certainly got a little bit of a help there. We talked a little bit about discretionary spending. If you think about travel that was down about 100 basis points. We are itching to get out to visit customers and our locations, and we'll start to do that slowly but some of that will get leveraged with better revenue momentum as well. And then the third thing I'll say is last year you might recall we had a pretty high medical expense in the first quarter. We kind of settled back into our normal range and that was a benefit of about 90 basis points. All-in-all though, Andy, it points to our ability to really control the costs and manage the business pretty well in a highly disruptive period of time. And it also shows that as we move out of this, we have some -- we will continue to invest in revenue producing positions and the growth routes, et cetera.\nOperator: Andrew Steinerman.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. It\u2019s Anderw. I just wanted to get a little more clarification about monthly trends. I definitely understand we're in uncertain times, and there's so many jobs to return to the workplace yet. I just wasn't sure if when you were talking about year-over-year organic revenue declines in rental. If you saw September, meaning what we've already experienced continue to narrow from August, so are declines now in September year-over-year versus August, or have we already seen kind of September declines sort of hover with August? So it's really -- is the uncertainty in like October, November, or have you already seen some hovering in September?\nMike Hansen: Andrew, we saw some really nice momentum. And certainly, Todd, talked about the highly disruptive period at the beginning of the quarter. And so the job recovery, the economic recovery was pretty extreme in the early part of the summer and the business reopenings moderated as certainly as the summer went on. But our revenue performance improvement continued through the quarter, and we still believe that -- we're still looking to see sequential improvement. And so September, while moderated from let's say June and early July, is still moving in the right direction and trending in the way that we would want it.\nOperator: Next we'll here from Gary Bisbee at Bank of America.\nGary Bisbee: I guess I'd love to go back to the margins a bit more. So you've obviously done a great job cutting costs and deferring some investments. And I heard you earlier, answer to the earlier question about what helped in this quarter? But can you give us any sense of how to think about the cadence of costs coming back? Do you envision ability to manage that pretty tightly with sequential improvement in revenue? Or are there some costs at some point that it could come back more quickly? And I guess as part of that, have you identified anything within your cost reduction efforts to date that you think could turn into more permanent or sustainable cost reductions for the business?\nScott Farmer: Gary, this is Scott. First of all, as we look out into the second quarter and beyond, we are confident in our ability to control our costs. And we are still really managing labor at the very top of the organization so that people who are adding or want to add positions have to make sure that they're going through the proper channels to get approval to do that. Things that we need to do to invest in the business are going to come back on line, that may be trucks that have been and/or service reps that have been idled because of this disruption, because of the growth that we've seen through the first quarter, some of that is coming back online as a result of that that's driving some production. Labor to produce the goods. We're bringing some sales people back online that were temporarily on the sidelines. In the second quarter, we're back to advertising both national radio advertising and some TV advertising that you may have seen this past weekend. So these are the kind of costs that we think are necessary to continue to grow the business and to get our brand out there kind of customers and prospects. But we're very confident in our ability to manage these costs. Are there things that we look at to say maybe we don't need those, or as much of that or that might have a long-term impact? We're always looking for those kind of things and that is part of the culture that we have as a company. And when we find them, we pretty much jump on them and make sure that we can drive those cost out of the organization. I think that they\u2019re nothing major at this point that we saw in the first quarter but there will be some things that will change the way we operate and do the business moving forward. We're much more efficient right now out of necessity than we have been. And I think that that's always good for any organization to put themselves in a position where they look around and you realize what else can we do to get efficient. So I think we've done a really good job. And my expectation is that we'll continue to do so. That said, there are going to be some things that are coming back online in the second quarter that I think for the long-term -- intermediate and long-term benefit of the business and our ability to grow our necessary expenses, all of which are within the guidance.\nTodd Schneider: Gary, this is Todd. As Scott talked about growing is expensive, right? It\u2019s an investment. And I think we've shown the ability to manage those expenses on the way down, meaning as the economy kind of went off a clip. And we will manage them on the way up as well and hopefully, that continues. And I got to tell you it\u2019s a whole lot more fun to manage on the way up than there\u2019s on way down and our people feel that way. And when you go through these types of cataclysmic events, as Scott mentioned, it makes you look through different lens. You evaluate the organization different. And one of the interesting items is how we engage with our customers, do they want us there -- should we be there in person as much, whether it\u2019s a Teams call, or a Zoom call, or a FaceTime, whatever it is, business moves fast. And we're evaluating that, our customers are valuing that. But it does allow things to speed up. And will that have a long-term impact? It could. We shall see, I think, certainly, in the short and intermediate future that\u2019s what we see.\nGary Bisbee: Great. Thanks. And then just to follow up, you talk a lot about sanitizer sales and the big opportunity there. Is it right that that all flows through the hygiene facilities business within rental? And if that is right, can you give us any sense sort of how well that's doing and maybe what the underlying rental revenue trend is today or how it's been trending, excluding that hygiene business. Just trying to get a sense if that's doing a lot worse and hygiene is just absolutely killing it today. Any color on that would be great. Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: So the sanitizer sales predominantly flows through rentals, certainly our first aid customers as well. We sell sanitizer whether it's in various forms. So you'll see it in both but predominantly in the rental organization just because of the scope of their organization and our customer base, et cetera. And sanitizer sell is going quite well. But you know what, it is leading to other sales as well. It gets us in the door and allows us to, as we mentioned earlier, it's getting us in front of prospects we've never been in front of before. It's getting in front of decision makers we weren't able to get to in the past. I think on our last call, we spoke about a really large banks that we had hardly done business with before and now they have sanitizer service at all their branches, which is significant. But it also -- now they\u2019re talking to us about first aid and they're talking to us about fire and other rental products. So those types of urgent needs allow for our people to get in and help explain to people what we do, how we do it, the value we provide and it opened some eyes and we're able to sell more. So it\u2019s really encouraging.\nOperator: Next question from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair.\nTim Mulrooney: Two quick ones on the balance sheet here guys. First of all, you got a lot of cash piling up on the balance sheet here. Is this just a prudent to have extra liquidity given the macro uncertainty? And can you share what your capital allocation priorities are for this year?\nScott Farmer: Yeah, first of all, there's a lot of uncertainty still out there. We like having some cash on the balance sheet in case anything comes up that is unforeseen and our balance sheet is strong anyway. But it certainly helps us have a more optimistic view of the future when we have that on the balance sheet. I think that normally in a normal environment with our ability to generate cash, we're looking for acquisitions, we're looking for what we can do relative to investing back into business, dividends, share buybacks and such to help improve our shareholders\u2019 overall return. And I would say that as things become a little more clear, as we get out into the future, we'll get back to our normal process. And then we've got a pretty good track record of how we manage those things for our shareholders and I would expect that we'll be back to that hopefully soon. Hopefully, we'll get a vaccine that will work at some point and get back to more normal environment.\nTim Mulrooney: Does that include CapEx getting back to normal run rate? It was like $30 million in the quarter, that\u2019s I think less than half of what you did last year. Would you expect that to get back just as I\u2019m thinking about my models?\nScott Farmer: Yeah, I'd say this. I don't know that you're going to see a lot of increase in CapEx in the second quarter. Most of the time CapEx is -- about 60% of that is for growth and 40% is for maintenance. We do have some capacity in markets with ability to put some more trucks on the road and within our production facilities. So I don't know that the growth CapEx is going to be necessary in the second quarter. We get out much beyond that. It's still a little cloudy out there for us to predict. But I can see that hopefully by the end of the year, we're back to a more than normal CapEx spend and that means that hopefully we'll be seeing a more normalized growth environment for us.\nOperator: Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: Just curious about kind of the pain point in markets that you have been doing as well. I think airlines, crude maybe oil and gas. Could you give us an idea just percent of revenue is being impacted that would not be in the fiscal second quarter guidance as anticipated to see improvement? And then I know there are different things in those end markets, so it\u2019s not that easy to do. But just to give us a feel of how much of the revenues are impacted that you don't see coming back in near-term? Thanks.\nScott Farmer: Scott, most of those highly impacted segments are in our direct sale business, that would be the travel and hospitality related customer base, that would be hotels and airlines and crude ships and even gaming is in there. Those revenues are off significantly in the direct sale business. We think it\u2019s going to continue that way for the foreseeable future. I think that those are probably a longer lead time to see those to see if those come back as their customer base gets more and more comfortable with getting on an airplane, going to an airport or flying to a city, taking a taxi to a hotel and so forth. So I think that we're going to see those areas struggle for a while. That is all in our guidance and it\u2019s also in our results for the first quarter. I would say that the second quarter probably for those related industry segments will perform similarly to the way they did it the first quarter. There may be a few in there that do a little better than others. But I'd say it's probably, at this point, through the second quarter more of the same in those segments.\nScott Schneeberger: And maybe just as a follow up broadly, I don\u2019t think you guys touched upon the ERP and what you're seeing now that that\u2019s mostly implemented. So just a quick update on that please. Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Well, our ERP is, we roll it out across our first aid and our rental division over the past few years. And we're seeing some real nice advantages there, whether it affects our ability to get product to customer faster has been a nice impact. Our transparency into the data, the ability to look at the customer across business units has been advantageous, especially as we go-to-market in some of the key segments has been significant. So we're very happy to be done with the integration, right, that was -- these are never funding process. But we're also seeing some real nice advantages there. And I'd say one of the bigger ones is the ability to get speed of product to customers, because of various items internally that allows us to get the product to that. So that customers really value that, especially in an environment like this where you can deliver when you say you will or faster in an environment where a lot of companies are struggling to do that and that's a big advantage for us.\nOperator: Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley has our next question.\nToni Kaplan: Just regarding the upcoming election, what are your thoughts on potential impacts on your business depending on the outcome? I was thinking of it as maybe under a Trump win? Seems like bringing back some manufacturing jobs into the U.S. could be good, but maybe higher tariffs could be a potential offset. Is that the right way to think about it? And how are you thinking about the puts and takes of a Biden win?\nScott Farmer: Well, yeah. I mean, there's a big difference between the two candidates and their intentions. I would say that the U.S. economy, not just us but the U.S. economy, will be affected depending on which candidate wins and assuming they both implement the things that they say, the positions that they have taken at this point. Biden administration more business regulation could slowdown business' ability to continue to grow. Higher taxes would obviously hit profits and earnings per share and then obviously, the impact of the overall stock market. And as you said, President Trump wants to continue to try to bring manufacturing jobs back and maintain or improve the current tax situation. But anyway, we will be impacted as much because of how our customers are impacted by whoever wins as anything else. So I think that as a general statement, because our customer and prospect base is such a broad spectrum of American industry that as American industry goes, we will go with it. I will say this, I am confident because we have managed through different versions of what different administrations have brought to into the U.S. economy that we can manage through this that we will manage through it as we have in the past, we got a really good track record of improvement that we can do that. And so we're optimistic either way about the long-term future of the company, I think that there may be some short-term differences that could come to bear depending on who wins.\nToni Kaplan: And just as a follow up. Just looking at the balance sheet kind of decent size inventory build the last two quarters. Just wanted to understand what's causing the increase, is that preparation for an eventual recovery and do you expect that to continue? How should we be thinking about that going forward?\nTodd Schneider: Toni, this is Todd. We see our balance sheet as an advantage. We see our ability to distribute as an advantage. And our customers need us to invest in those products in the short term so that we can help them with those. So in many cases, it has been a real competitive advantage us investing in that inventory where we have products that our competition does not. And our customers really appreciate the investment on their behalf and we're leveraging that.\nScott Farmer: This is Scott. Much of that buildup is in some of the items that are in high demand right now. The hand sanitizer and there you got to look at that in a lot of different ways. It\u2019s the actual fluid itself, the container that comes in, the dispensing units that we need, the stands and so forth. And so there is a build up of that inventory. But these are things that we are doing to take advantage of the opportunities that are in the marketplace right now. And we're very confident that because we've been able to do this and do it in such short order that we are winning business daily, because we have inventory. We talked about -- one of the examples I gave earlier on was that we got a very large account, because we were able to deliver masks in a matter of days that other companies were telling that prospect it would take months to get those. We had another example of a large customer, multilocation customer that decided to give a third of their hand sanitizer stand business to us, a third one of our competitors and a third competitor. We implemented that program with thousands of stands in a week. One of the competitors came back and said we can't deliver it within your timeframe. So they gave us that third. We did that the next week thousands of stands. And the third competitor can only do about half of what they said they could do so they're giving us half of that third of the business. And it's because we have the inventory available today to service those accounts. And so we look at that and what we've been able to do with our global supply chain, and our ability to get those products out into the marketplace quickly as a significant competitive advantage and we're taking advantage of it right now.\nOperator: Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel Nicholas.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, usually in labor intensive businesses, hiring is really indicative of what companies think is coming down the pike in demand. And I know you guys had a hiring freeze not that long ago looking at your open positions now between 1,600 and 1,700 open positions. Could you just discuss -- is that a normal amount of positions you'd have open? If there were not a pandemic, is it a higher amount because there\u2019s a catch up? Is there a lower amount? How should I think of this in terms of indicating what you guys are thinking about?\nTodd Schneider: Shlomo, this is Todd. So I can't answer your specific -- I don't track requisitions by what we have out there by month. But I can tell you that it's certainly an increase from what it was 90 days ago. And we're on -- we try to match up our demand for our services, the supply of our products or services, our infrastructure, our people and we're matching it up appropriately. So we look forward to Q2, Q3 and Q4 and we see demand continue to increase. We're certainly conscious of all the external factors, whether they'd be what's going on with the pandemic, what's going on with the election, all those items but we're investing for the future. And we're bringing back to those folks many, many of which are revenue generating partners that will help us continue our positive trend.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: And then maybe you could give a little bit more color on how you're thinking of the business units. I believe last quarter you guys gave little bit more detail on that in terms of the next quarter. I don\u2019t know if you want to talk at that granular level this quarter as well?\nMike Hansen: So, Shlomo you were a little hard to hear, I think your question was regarding how each of our businesses is performing as we enter the second quarter and how do we feel about that performance. And Shlomo, I would say that the first of all as guidance encompasses all of what I'm going to mention. But Todd talked a little bit about the momentum of the rental business and we continue to see a nice trend line, even though it's moderated a bit from that heavy disruptive period early in this first quarter. But we still continue to add really good new business and we're continuing to sell these hygiene products that Todd talked a bit about. In our first aid and safety, we've had two quarters of high-teens growth, and Scott talk a little bit about -- these are big sales of personal protective equipment are hard to predict. And so they happen but then they generally will go into maintenance mode. And so our expectation is we'll see a little bit more maintenance mode in the first aid and safety business in Q2. But still very, very good results. We are very excited about that business. The fire business, which was down organically about 12% in the fourth quarter, was down organically just over 5% in this first quarter. And now that business continues to perform well and continue to move on and improving trend line. And then lastly Scott talked a little bit about our direct sales business, which was down 47% in the first quarter, and probably see that as another quarter of pretty difficult time given that customer base. So that's the way we view the second quarter, keeping in mind that it is at the mid point and higher end of that guidance, it calls for sequential improvement and nice sequential improvement of that. So again, we like the momentum of the business and the execution of it as well. Did that answer your question, Shlomo?\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Yeah, thank you very much.\nOperator: And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments.\nPaul Adler: All right. Well, thank you for joining us this morning and for your interest in Cintas. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '21 financial results in December, and look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott and good morning. Our fiscal 2021 first quarter revenue was $1.75 billion, a decrease of 3.6% from last year's first quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. Free cash flow, which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for this year's first quarter, was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6%. Organic revenue adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and differences in the number of workdays, declined 5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Organic revenue for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment declined 5.4%. Organic revenue for the first aid and safety services' operating segment increased 17.1%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $826.2 million decreased 2.7%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue 47.3% for the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 46.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 27.3% in the first quarter and 30% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Fiscal \u201821 first quarter results benefited from lower expenses as a percentage of revenue in many areas, including discretionary spending. Operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 of $349.7 million increased 14.2%. Operating margin was 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20. Our fiscal first quarter contained one more workday than the prior year first quarter. One more workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense, and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was 7.8% compared to 10.1% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal '21 was $300 million, an increase of 19.6%. Earnings per diluted share were $2.78, an increase of 19.8% from last year's first quarter. In addition to the solid financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow. First quarter free cash flow was $281.4 million, an increase of 32.6% compared to last year. Our leverage calculation for our credit facility definition was 1.6 times debt to EBITDA. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an untapped credit facility of $1 billion. For financial modeling purposes, please note that there will be one more workday in our fiscal '21 than in our fiscal '20. One more day will benefit fiscal '21 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. One more workday also benefits operating margin and EPS. Fiscal '21 operating income margin will be about 12.5 basis points better in comparison to fiscal '20 due to one more day of revenue. In fiscal '20 each quarter contained 65 workdays. In fiscal '21, workdays by quarter are 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4. Please keep these differences in mind when modeling results on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Before turning the call over to Todd Schneider to discuss the performance of each of our businesses, I want to comment on fiscal '21 financial guidance. Due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of economic recovery. Therefore, we are not providing annual guidance at this time. However, we would like to provide our second quarter financial expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.75 billion and EPS to be in the range of $2 to $2.20. Please note the following regarding second quarter financial expectations. Our second quarter contains the same number of workdays as last year's second quarter, but one less than our first quarter. We expect operating margin as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 17.5% to 19%. And we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be about 22% compared to 20.1% in last year's second quarter. I'll now turn it over to Todd. Yeah. I think, George, from an incremental margin perspective, we talked a lot about in the past, we like incremental operating margins to be in the 20% to 30% range. Clearly, we've exceeded that in this first quarter. But that's the -- longer term, that still is the range that we like to see, because it really keeps us in a cadence where we are growing in the way that we want to grow and we are managing the number of sales people that we need and the number of routes that we need, the amount of capacity that we need, and when we are growing the way we want to grow, we actually like that 20% to 30% range and expect that that will continue as we get out of this really disruptive and bumpy period. So Manav, I think you're asking is there -- we talked about new business, about 60% of our new business coming from new programmers, and is that the case as we sit here in this disruptive period and are we seeing any differences in the way that our competitors are coming to market and competing. And I'll start, as Todd mentioned earlier, our new business continues to be very, very robust. And we're selling not just the same mix of product from six months ago but a little bit of a different mix as it relates to this hygiene messaging, which is resonating so well. And so that certainly can lead to new types of prospects that we may not have talked to in the past. And when we get our foot in the door good things can happen. When they start to see our service, we can continue to talk about other needs that they may have. And so we've seen some nice success in that during this -- even during the fourth quarter but more so in this first quarter. And maybe I'll offer a couple points. One is Scott talk a little earlier about the first aid and safety, large personal protective equipment sales there that kind of turned into maintenance a little bit. So keep that in mind. Another point I'll make is if you think about the first quarter revenue on the same workdays as Q2, you're talking about 1.720 billion. And so we do see some -- that guidance range especially at the top of it does look too nice sequential improvement. And keep in mind -- the last point I'll make is last year's second quarter was a pretty good quarter for us as well. And so when you put it all together echoing what Todd said, we remain excited about the performance and the momentum that we have, particularly in a bit of a challenging environment and one that still contains a fair amount of I'll say lack of clarity, let's say. And so we think this guidance range really points to continued nice momentum improvement. Sure. I'll start that. I wouldn't call out any specific one-time items. But as you think about this period of time that we're in, we entered the quarter with a fair amount of disruption and lack of clarity. And we entered it with a hiring freeze, a wage rate freeze and pretty tight control on discretionary spending. And as the quarter went on, revenue obviously came a bit higher than our guidance range and we've been pleased with that. And so we started to bring -- we started hire back revenue producing positions and that certainly will have an impact as we move forward. But in the first quarter in this period of just extreme disruption, we entered it with a lot of uncertainty and we exited with still some uncertainty, but better momentum than we certainly expected. I'll point to a couple of things though within the quarter. Energy was 30 basis points better than a year ago. So we certainly got a little bit of a help there. We talked a little bit about discretionary spending. If you think about travel that was down about 100 basis points. We are itching to get out to visit customers and our locations, and we'll start to do that slowly but some of that will get leveraged with better revenue momentum as well. And then the third thing I'll say is last year you might recall we had a pretty high medical expense in the first quarter. We kind of settled back into our normal range and that was a benefit of about 90 basis points. All-in-all though, Andy, it points to our ability to really control the costs and manage the business pretty well in a highly disruptive period of time. And it also shows that as we move out of this, we have some -- we will continue to invest in revenue producing positions and the growth routes, et cetera. Andrew, we saw some really nice momentum. And certainly, Todd, talked about the highly disruptive period at the beginning of the quarter. And so the job recovery, the economic recovery was pretty extreme in the early part of the summer and the business reopenings moderated as certainly as the summer went on. But our revenue performance improvement continued through the quarter, and we still believe that -- we're still looking to see sequential improvement. And so September, while moderated from let's say June and early July, is still moving in the right direction and trending in the way that we would want it. So, Shlomo you were a little hard to hear, I think your question was regarding how each of our businesses is performing as we enter the second quarter and how do we feel about that performance. And Shlomo, I would say that the first of all as guidance encompasses all of what I'm going to mention. But Todd talked a little bit about the momentum of the rental business and we continue to see a nice trend line, even though it's moderated a bit from that heavy disruptive period early in this first quarter. But we still continue to add really good new business and we're continuing to sell these hygiene products that Todd talked a bit about. In our first aid and safety, we've had two quarters of high-teens growth, and Scott talk a little bit about -- these are big sales of personal protective equipment are hard to predict. And so they happen but then they generally will go into maintenance mode. And so our expectation is we'll see a little bit more maintenance mode in the first aid and safety business in Q2. But still very, very good results. We are very excited about that business. The fire business, which was down organically about 12% in the fourth quarter, was down organically just over 5% in this first quarter. And now that business continues to perform well and continue to move on and improving trend line. And then lastly Scott talked a little bit about our direct sales business, which was down 47% in the first quarter, and probably see that as another quarter of pretty difficult time given that customer base. So that's the way we view the second quarter, keeping in mind that it is at the mid point and higher end of that guidance, it calls for sequential improvement and nice sequential improvement of that. So again, we like the momentum of the business and the execution of it as well. Did that answer your question, Shlomo?"

            "name": "Scott Farmer",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. This continues to be a challenging time for our employees, who we call partners, are doing all they can do to keep our customers' places of business clean, safe and ready for the workday. Our employee partners have remained diligent in their care of our customers providing essential products and services. And they remain diligent in their care of each other, and we can't thank them enough for their truly impressive achievements. Before we get into the financial results, I'd like to provide you with some examples of our interactions with our customers in the first quarter of our fiscal year, so you will have a better understanding of our business. A hospital system in Michigan provided isolation gowns to their staff and laundered them in the hospital. These garments are fluid resistant protective clothing worn by doctors and nurses. The hospital had difficulty staffing the laundry and suffered quality issues. The hospital system, a no programmer as we call it, decided to outsource the procurement and laundering to Cintas so they could concentrate on patient care. Another no programmer, a dental alliance with 55 locations in three states, signed with us for scrubs in a rental program for 550 wearers. Due to their satisfaction with the service, they're in discussions with us to add facility services products and first aid supplies. In California, one university system with many campuses signed a multi-year agreement for hand sanitizer service. In addition, our first aid business is providing them with $0.5 million of hard to find gloves. To another university system in California, our first aid division is providing over a million facemasks. A restaurant chain that has been a customer since 2007 had been struggling in the first few months of the pandemic. In talking with the customer, we listened and were empathetic and adjusted service frequencies and inventories in partnership with them. They were so pleased with the way that we treated them that they renewed our service agreement and added hand sanitizer stand service to every one of the restaurants. A casino customer in Ohio recently reopened after being dormant due to COVID-19 restrictions. In order to conduct business in the new environment, casino added rental mask services and additional items to increase cleaning protocols including dusk mats and microfiber mops, and towels. And a city government in Texas was a no programmer until they came to us for a hand sanitizer program for all of their government buildings. They were so happy with the execution that we gained their trust to provide some of their Personal Protective Equipment needs as well. They were impressed with our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of masks within days. These examples are just a handful of the many and were offered to highlight the following; our opportunity to convert no programmers, the do-it yourselfers remains robust; scrubs and isolation gowns are indicative of a broad uniform rental opportunity. Our approach is being flexible with customers in the short term reach, long-term benefits. Our Net Promoter Scores, which we use to measure customer satisfaction has never been higher. Earning the trust of the customer enables us to penetrate -- enables further penetration and cross selling, and our supply chain and service network, our competitive advantages, enabling us to increase service to existing customers and add new customers by procuring and providing items in short supply. Our value proposition of getting businesses ready for the workday by providing essential unparalleled image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance has never resonated more than it does today. A new trend of greater focus on health, readiness, and outsourcing of non-core activities is under way. We are well positioned for this new normal. I'll turn the call over to Mike now for commentary on the financial results. Mike? Seth, this is Scott. I'll take the first part of that. I'll let Todd take the second part of that. On first aid and safety, I think the way that is probably the best way for you all to look at it is that a lot of the initial upfront large sales of PPE through the first aid business are similar to what happens in the direct sales business. When we sell a big new customer, there's a large upfront sale of these goods and then it will -- that customer's revenue will drop to a maintenance level. And so, we are seeing that in the first quarter we did have a lot of large upfront sales to customers in the first aid and safety business that are now moving into that maintenance level. That doesn't mean that there aren't other customers out there that we can find and identify, but I think that there was a big rush of that in our first quarter as pandemic hit, and so I would say we're probably closer in the second quarter to move it more into the maintenance mode on those type of things. I would say that probably means that we may not drill in the high-teens in the first aid and safety, but we will continue to see very good growth in first aid and safety. Hi, George. This is Scott. When we talk about revenue in the healthcare segment, keep in mind that we're talking about all the products and services that we would provide to the healthcare segment that is both fire service, first aid service, some direct sales business, and obviously some rental -- uniform rental and FS business. It represents about 7% of our total revenue now. We're excited about what we see in that segment. Healthcare represents about 17% of GDP. And so we think we continue to have a big opportunity in healthcare. The scrub rental business and these isolation gowns -- from your perspective if you just simply refer to those as the scrub business, I think you'd be safe. These isolation gowns are things typically worn over the top of the scrub, dealing with particular patients to protect the nurse or doctor from bodily fluids and things like that that. No need to get into a whole separate category on that. But we're excited on what we see there. The COVID has brought a realization to healthcare providers that taking -- wearing scrubs to work and then wearing them home may not be the right approach, and they're looking for ways to outsource managing those programs for them and we really like the position that we're in. I would say that healthcare has a great opportunity to be the first segment that we service to grow to over 10% of our total revenue. And so, we remain very optimistic about this segment. Yeah, happy to provide a little color there and Todd may want to chime in as we go through this. But the pre-COVID we had decision makers that had time to review things, try to get multiple competitive looks and things like that when we're out in the marketplace. I think that the urgency of trying to find certain products and services certainly shortened that sales cycle, decisions were made more quickly. It's not to say that they weren't trying to find competitive bids. But in many cases, it was hard for competitors to come up with the products and services they needed to fulfill a customer's order. I'm proud to say that we did a really good job of making sure that we were in front of that and had inventory. And so we've been reasonably successful in being able to help these companies out. As we look at sales productivity amongst our sales force we have been through the entire COVID period, selling at very impressive productivity rates, very high historically. We'd like to see that happen. We think it's a good sign for the foreseeable future for the company. And so you combine that sales productivity with decision makers that are in the market, trying to make reasonably quick decisions and we think we can do very well in that regard. Todd, I don't know you have anything to add? And I'd say it this way just to echo what Todd said. What we do that most of our competitors who have been in this space for some period of time don't do is that we're there every week so we make sure that they always have inventory and they never run out. Most of the time, a customer who's buying it from a supply house or a traditional competitor has to take it upon themselves to realize that they're running low on inventory, sometimes that happens when they're out of inventory then they have to go and place the order, they have to wait for the order to come to them. They're out of supply for maybe a few days and that sort of thing. And they don't have to worry about that when we're taking care of it for them. And restrooms are something that every single business has to deal with. And when we take care of that for them, it's one less detail that they have to worry about in the course of their business day and allows them to focus their time and attention on taking care of their customers. So I think that's the value proposition that we're offering in the hygiene business. Obviously, that depends on geography, industry segment and that sort of thing. It's different in each one, because of various local governments or state governments that have put restrictions in place. I'd say generally speaking the small customers that are open right now are weathering this -- as a general statement, pretty darn well. I think it says a lot about the American entrepreneurial spirit to see them, able to do the things that they're doing with the new rules in place, be they face masks and outdoor dining and such. But some of them -- many of them are not at full capacity yet because of various restrictions that have been put on them, or customers that may not be ready to come back out to frequent their businesses. So clearly, I think for the American economy, for the global economy, a vaccine is going to be very well received so that the rules can change and businesses can get back to operating under a sort of a new normal but a normal that allows them to operate in a more traditional fashion. Gary, this is Scott. First of all, as we look out into the second quarter and beyond, we are confident in our ability to control our costs. And we are still really managing labor at the very top of the organization so that people who are adding or want to add positions have to make sure that they're going through the proper channels to get approval to do that. Things that we need to do to invest in the business are going to come back on line, that may be trucks that have been and/or service reps that have been idled because of this disruption, because of the growth that we've seen through the first quarter, some of that is coming back online as a result of that that's driving some production. Labor to produce the goods. We're bringing some sales people back online that were temporarily on the sidelines. In the second quarter, we're back to advertising both national radio advertising and some TV advertising that you may have seen this past weekend. So these are the kind of costs that we think are necessary to continue to grow the business and to get our brand out there kind of customers and prospects. But we're very confident in our ability to manage these costs. Are there things that we look at to say maybe we don't need those, or as much of that or that might have a long-term impact? We're always looking for those kind of things and that is part of the culture that we have as a company. And when we find them, we pretty much jump on them and make sure that we can drive those cost out of the organization. I think that they're nothing major at this point that we saw in the first quarter but there will be some things that will change the way we operate and do the business moving forward. We're much more efficient right now out of necessity than we have been. And I think that that's always good for any organization to put themselves in a position where they look around and you realize what else can we do to get efficient. So I think we've done a really good job. And my expectation is that we'll continue to do so. That said, there are going to be some things that are coming back online in the second quarter that I think for the long-term -- intermediate and long-term benefit of the business and our ability to grow our necessary expenses, all of which are within the guidance. Yeah, first of all, there's a lot of uncertainty still out there. We like having some cash on the balance sheet in case anything comes up that is unforeseen and our balance sheet is strong anyway. But it certainly helps us have a more optimistic view of the future when we have that on the balance sheet. I think that normally in a normal environment with our ability to generate cash, we're looking for acquisitions, we're looking for what we can do relative to investing back into business, dividends, share buybacks and such to help improve our shareholders' overall return. And I would say that as things become a little more clear, as we get out into the future, we'll get back to our normal process. And then we've got a pretty good track record of how we manage those things for our shareholders and I would expect that we'll be back to that hopefully soon. Hopefully, we'll get a vaccine that will work at some point and get back to more normal environment. Yeah, I'd say this. I don't know that you're going to see a lot of increase in CapEx in the second quarter. Most of the time CapEx is -- about 60% of that is for growth and 40% is for maintenance. We do have some capacity in markets with ability to put some more trucks on the road and within our production facilities. So I don't know that the growth CapEx is going to be necessary in the second quarter. We get out much beyond that. It's still a little cloudy out there for us to predict. But I can see that hopefully by the end of the year, we're back to a more than normal CapEx spend and that means that hopefully we'll be seeing a more normalized growth environment for us. Scott, most of those highly impacted segments are in our direct sale business, that would be the travel and hospitality related customer base, that would be hotels and airlines and crude ships and even gaming is in there. Those revenues are off significantly in the direct sale business. We think it's going to continue that way for the foreseeable future. I think that those are probably a longer lead time to see those to see if those come back as their customer base gets more and more comfortable with getting on an airplane, going to an airport or flying to a city, taking a taxi to a hotel and so forth. So I think that we're going to see those areas struggle for a while. That is all in our guidance and it's also in our results for the first quarter. I would say that the second quarter probably for those related industry segments will perform similarly to the way they did it the first quarter. There may be a few in there that do a little better than others. But I'd say it's probably, at this point, through the second quarter more of the same in those segments. Well, yeah. I mean, there's a big difference between the two candidates and their intentions. I would say that the U.S. economy, not just us but the U.S. economy, will be affected depending on which candidate wins and assuming they both implement the things that they say, the positions that they have taken at this point. Biden administration more business regulation could slowdown business' ability to continue to grow. Higher taxes would obviously hit profits and earnings per share and then obviously, the impact of the overall stock market. And as you said, President Trump wants to continue to try to bring manufacturing jobs back and maintain or improve the current tax situation. But anyway, we will be impacted as much because of how our customers are impacted by whoever wins as anything else. So I think that as a general statement, because our customer and prospect base is such a broad spectrum of American industry that as American industry goes, we will go with it. I will say this, I am confident because we have managed through different versions of what different administrations have brought to into the U.S. economy that we can manage through this that we will manage through it as we have in the past, we got a really good track record of improvement that we can do that. And so we're optimistic either way about the long-term future of the company, I think that there may be some short-term differences that could come to bear depending on who wins. This is Scott. Much of that buildup is in some of the items that are in high demand right now. The hand sanitizer and there you got to look at that in a lot of different ways. It's the actual fluid itself, the container that comes in, the dispensing units that we need, the stands and so forth. And so there is a build up of that inventory. But these are things that we are doing to take advantage of the opportunities that are in the marketplace right now. And we're very confident that because we've been able to do this and do it in such short order that we are winning business daily, because we have inventory. We talked about -- one of the examples I gave earlier on was that we got a very large account, because we were able to deliver masks in a matter of days that other companies were telling that prospect it would take months to get those. We had another example of a large customer, multilocation customer that decided to give a third of their hand sanitizer stand business to us, a third one of our competitors and a third competitor. We implemented that program with thousands of stands in a week. One of the competitors came back and said we can't deliver it within your timeframe. So they gave us that third. We did that the next week thousands of stands. And the third competitor can only do about half of what they said they could do so they're giving us half of that third of the business. And it's because we have the inventory available today to service those accounts. And so we look at that and what we've been able to do with our global supply chain, and our ability to get those products out into the marketplace quickly as a significant competitive advantage and we're taking advantage of it right now."

            "name": "Todd Schneider",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Mike. Before I review the business results, I'd like to build off with Scott's comments. While the environment remains challenging and uncertain, we did experienced a continued improvement in results through the quarter. The majority of our existing customers have reopening and our employee partners work diligently in partnership with these businesses to get them ready for the work day. Despite reopening, many existing customers are not yet operating at the same level of business before the COVID-19 pandemic started, because of the virus's impact on health and the economy. In keeping with the Cintas culture, our employee partners are working with urgency to offset these headwinds. Significant opportunities for new revenues exists because of the need of businesses to instill confidence in their employees, customers, students, patients, et cetera, that they will remain healthy and safe. Additionally, businesses are outsourcing tasks that are not their core competency, so they can successfully navigate these challenging times. The value we provide businesses has never been more evident. In fact, we've been given a seat at the table in discussions with state and local officials, hospital administrations, COVID-19 procurement task forces and hospitality cleanliness counsels. There is greater demand for services and products we already provide such as health [Technical difficulty] in other areas, demand is so attractive that we are providing new services and products made possible by our supply chain, distribution network, sales force and cash flow. These include rental healthcare isolation gowns, hand sanitizer stand dispenser service and sanitizing spray service. With that, I'll turn now to the first quarter financial performance of our business. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, healthcare scrubs, masks and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs for our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.39 billion, a decrease of 4.1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and the difference in the number of workdays, the organic revenue declined 5.4%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 48.7% for the first quarter compared to 47.2% in last year's first quarter. Prior inventory amortization expense of 80 basis points was more than offset by the benefit of lower production and service expense as a percent of revenue, the additional workday and lower energy expenses. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, personal protective equipment and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $204.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 17.1%. The first aid segment gross margin was 40.2% in the first quarter compared to 49% in last year's first quarter. Lower production and service expenses as a percent of revenue compared to last year first quarter were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold from the increased proportion of revenue from personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. Our Fire Protection Services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other categories. Our fire business historically grows each year at a strong pace. Uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low-single-digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform direct sale, however, is a key business for us and as customers are offered significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $147.7 million, a decrease of 20%. Organic revenue declined 22.2%. The fire business organic revenue declined 5.3% due to the inability to access some businesses because of closures. The uniform direct sale business organic revenue declined 47.3%. Revenue from our airline, cruise line, hospitality and gaming customers largely falls within this segment. These industries continue to be among the hardest hit by the pandemic. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions. We kind of end up in a large first order and then there is some maintenance mode there, but we're really focused on taking care of our customers. They are -- and there's great demand for some of these products out there, gloves, masks, hand sanitizers et cetera. So, we're blessed to be in a good position in the inventory and be able to take care of them, but we are encouraged still that we're selling a lot of first aid cabinets that's going well, and we think things will moderate in growth, probably we're also anxious to see the COGS to moderate back to closer to where it was before. Seth, you sound a bit muffled. Can you start that question over please? Yeah, our new cabinet sales are going quite well, but we have a heck of a lot of customers that are still on the sidelines. They're close. So that's certainly affecting what is being procured through our cabinets, and we're anxious for those businesses to get back up and running. But long-term, while we pivoted helping our customers and long-term we're quite bullish on the direction of the organization. Yeah. It's good question. It really varies dramatically based upon whom you're calling on, the products you're selling. Our sales organization is highly urgent anyway and highly adaptable. And I've been really impressed by how they've been able to overcome any obstacles that were -- it seems like came in their way. But we have products and services that people really need to -- I'll say instill confidence in their employees, in their guests, in their customers, how you want to describe their students, their patients. When you have those available, it does shorten the sales cycle, because there is some times where we walk in and they say, my goodness, you have that, let's go. And so, again, there's so many different sales processes going on at any one time. It's tough to say, make a sweeping statement. But just generally speaking, yeah, it set it up because of the urgency of making sure people are taken care of. And we are again blessed to be in a good spot with it products and services, and that creates confidence in our people, in our customers and showing in the productivity. Hamzah, I'll start then Scott can feel free to jump in. And we appreciate your comment on our products. We invest a heck of a lot into our R&D to make sure that we have really attractive functional products, a lot of investment in it. And we have been in the hygiene business for I'll call it decades, right? It's just we spoke in our last call about how 9/11, September 11, 2001 had a dynamic impact on security and we believe that this pandemic is going to have a similar effect on hygiene in our world, and that has been something that's been positive for our business. So our customers love the fact that we have availability. We have attractive products. We have a great inventory distribution system. Very fair approach to how we handle things. And we have a great suite of products and services that are right there on the truck. They can deal with one organization that can handle all their needs we're able to -- because the vast majority of our routes service our customers weekly and allow for us to be able to inspect what they have, where they are from an inventory standpoint and help provide some consultative services instead of just tell us when you need some more product. So that route infrastructure and obviously, distribution center system is a real strategic advantage for us moving forward. Frankly, that was part of the question of the sales cycle. The sales cycle is certainly a big setup just because we all saw more no programmers. There is no hurdle it hit over to sale something they can buy immediately and that can be a positive for us. As Mike mentioned, if we're selling into different -- a variety of different prospects and we're also, because of the urgency and the intensity of what we're -- what is important to these businesses, we're going to get at levels of decision makers that we weren't in the past quicker. So that again speak things up. When decision makers hear our value proposition it resonates. And so there is certainly don't -- pandemic has been absolutely horrible for the country, the world, it's been major for our customers. But if there is some shining light it's bringing more focus to the products and services that we have and the value that we provide and getting us an audience at high levels and quicker. Certainly, this has been an unusual environment right? There was 22 million jobs that were lost, it seemed like overnight almost and then jobs returned pretty quickly in the early, very early portion of the summer. And then as you've seen that the summer we're on things moderated a bit and jobs returning and so 11 million people that are -- 11 million jobs that have not been recovered. So that has certainly impacted our business. So we need more businesses to come back. We are still guiding towards sequential growth from Q1 to Q2. We do have one less workday in Q2 versus Q1. And we're encouraged by our new business efforts, the products and services that we're selling, the engagement of our customers of what we're providing. But it takes a while for all those new business efforts to recover over all the businesses that are still closed and all the jobs that are still on the sidelines. But we're very much looking forward to Q2, Q3, Q4 and we like the trend line to work that we're seeing. Gary, this is Todd. As Scott talked about growing is expensive, right? It's an investment. And I think we've shown the ability to manage those expenses on the way down, meaning as the economy kind of went off a clip. And we will manage them on the way up as well and hopefully, that continues. And I got to tell you it's a whole lot more fun to manage on the way up than there's on way down and our people feel that way. And when you go through these types of cataclysmic events, as Scott mentioned, it makes you look through different lens. You evaluate the organization different. And one of the interesting items is how we engage with our customers, do they want us there -- should we be there in person as much, whether it's a Teams call, or a Zoom call, or a FaceTime, whatever it is, business moves fast. And we're evaluating that, our customers are valuing that. But it does allow things to speed up. And will that have a long-term impact? It could. We shall see, I think, certainly, in the short and intermediate future that's what we see. So the sanitizer sales predominantly flows through rentals, certainly our first aid customers as well. We sell sanitizer whether it's in various forms. So you'll see it in both but predominantly in the rental organization just because of the scope of their organization and our customer base, et cetera. And sanitizer sell is going quite well. But you know what, it is leading to other sales as well. It gets us in the door and allows us to, as we mentioned earlier, it's getting us in front of prospects we've never been in front of before. It's getting in front of decision makers we weren't able to get to in the past. I think on our last call, we spoke about a really large banks that we had hardly done business with before and now they have sanitizer service at all their branches, which is significant. But it also -- now they're talking to us about first aid and they're talking to us about fire and other rental products. So those types of urgent needs allow for our people to get in and help explain to people what we do, how we do it, the value we provide and it opened some eyes and we're able to sell more. So it's really encouraging. Well, our ERP is, we roll it out across our first aid and our rental division over the past few years. And we're seeing some real nice advantages there, whether it affects our ability to get product to customer faster has been a nice impact. Our transparency into the data, the ability to look at the customer across business units has been advantageous, especially as we go-to-market in some of the key segments has been significant. So we're very happy to be done with the integration, right, that was -- these are never funding process. But we're also seeing some real nice advantages there. And I'd say one of the bigger ones is the ability to get speed of product to customers, because of various items internally that allows us to get the product to that. So that customers really value that, especially in an environment like this where you can deliver when you say you will or faster in an environment where a lot of companies are struggling to do that and that's a big advantage for us. Toni, this is Todd. We see our balance sheet as an advantage. We see our ability to distribute as an advantage. And our customers need us to invest in those products in the short term so that we can help them with those. So in many cases, it has been a real competitive advantage us investing in that inventory where we have products that our competition does not. And our customers really appreciate the investment on their behalf and we're leveraging that. Shlomo, this is Todd. So I can't answer your specific -- I don't track requisitions by what we have out there by month. But I can tell you that it's certainly an increase from what it was 90 days ago. And we're on -- we try to match up our demand for our services, the supply of our products or services, our infrastructure, our people and we're matching it up appropriately. So we look forward to Q2, Q3 and Q4 and we see demand continue to increase. We're certainly conscious of all the external factors, whether they'd be what's going on with the pandemic, what's going on with the election, all those items but we're investing for the future. And we're bringing back to those folks many, many of which are revenue generating partners that will help us continue our positive trend."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Adler: Thanks Darren. And thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you Paul. Our fourth quarter financial results are led by a strong revenue increase of 13.0% to $2.07 billion. Despite strong inflationary headwinds, operating income margin increased 10 basis points to 19.5% and EPS grew 13.8% to $2.81. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing base. Businesses prioritize, [all we] [ph] provide including image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. Challenge was finding labor to run their business, heighten concerns over sanitization and the inflationary labor and purchasing costs, businesses increasingly outsourced to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. We were able to deliver increased operating margin and EPS despite this period of significant inflation by productively selling new business, penetrating existing customers with more products and services, providing excellent service while driving operational efficiencies and obtaining incremental price increases from our customer base. Fourth quarter free cash flow increased 15.2% from last year. On June 15, we paid shareholders $98.2 million in quarterly dividends. And during the fourth quarter and through July 13, 2022, we purchased $496.5 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder returns. We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results. They conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following: Fiscal year 2022 revenue was a record $7.85 billion, an increase of 10.4%. The organic revenue growth rate was 10.2%. Excluding two gains recorded this fiscal year and one recorded last fiscal year, operating income margin increased 50 basis points to 19.7%. We allocated capital to improve shareholder return. Acquisition spend was $164.2 million. In fiscal 2022 and up until today, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of Cintas stock for a total of $1.62 billion. Also, we increased the dividend 26.7%. We have increased the dividend every year since going public, which is 38 consecutive years. We made significant progress on our digital transformation journey. Our customers continue to find [added value] [ph] in managing their program through our online solution. We expect the ease of doing business with us to drive greater customer retention and faster revenue realization. We are actively using our new rolled out proprietary routing technology, which we call Smart Truck. This technology helps us make smarter routing decisions, enabling us to spend more time with our customers on service and sales, and also allows us to reduce energy usage and expense by driving fewer miles. We also made great strides in data analytics and enhanced business reporting, helping us target penetration, cross-selling, operational efficiencies, and pricing opportunities. In addition, as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our second environmental social and governance or ESG report. It's a more robust report. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. With this in mind, we announced our ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. And finally, our actions are being recognized. We were again named to the prestigious Fortune 500. It's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We were also recently added to the FTSE4Good Index Series. The Index Series includes companies demonstrating strong ESG practices. I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Cintas has grown revenue and adjusted EPS in 51 of the past 53 years. And our prospects for continued profitable growth are great. They result in part from a strong value proposition and a vast total addressable market. Every business, goods producing or services providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance. Operating a business is increasingly complex. Rather than doing it themselves, businesses increasingly outsource to Cintas. We provide the products and perform the services better, faster, and economically [frame businesses] [ph] to concentrate on their core competency. Since every business has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance, our total addressable market is vast. The prospects for Uniform or workwear rental are significant. The unserved workwear rental market is tremendous. Tens of billions of dollars of workwear are sold by retailers each year to workers in every sector of the economy. There are millions of people in healthcare alone, hospitals, urgent care, doctors office, dentists offices, and long-term care going to work every day in shrubs purchased from retailers. We focus on targeting these retail customers converting them to a rental program. The fact that consistently 60% of our new customers are converted from retail to a rental program speaks to the size of the opportunity, as well as our continued success. Plus, we are more than just a Uniform Rental company. More than half of our revenue is from facility services including hygiene, floor care items such as dust mats and mops, cleaning tools like microfiber mops and towels, first aid cabinet services, and fire protection services including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms. Every business that has a door, floor, wall, bathroom, and employees is a sales prospect. Our organic revenue growth rates are indicative of our compelling value proposition and tremendous market size. We grow revenue in multiples of GDP and jobs growth because of ample supply and demand for our products and services. Our growth in revenue is profitable growth and our operating margins have a long runway for expansion. Growth results in more buying power with our suppliers. It produces operating leverage. Route density increases reducing energy expenses and providing more time to spend with customers on service and sales. Growth means more volume in the plants, covering fixed cost of building, machinery and equipment. And when we penetrate existing customers with more products and services, the incremental operating margins are even stronger because we realize more revenue per service step. The future of Cintas remains bright. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to provide the details of our fourth quarter results and our financial expectations for fiscal 2023.\nMike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter revenue of $2.07 billion compares to $1.84 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 12.7%. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $1.63 billion, compared to $1.47 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 10.5%. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $218.2 million, compared to $186.9 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 15.1%. This strong growth rate reflects the growing momentum of our First Aid Cabinet business, which grew 25% in the fourth quarter. While personal protective equipment remains elevated compared to pre-COVID levels, PPE revenue was about 7% less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $226.2 million, compared to $181.9 million last year. The fire business organic growth rate was 18.3% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 53.5%, both businesses finished the year strong. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $946.2 million, compared to $859.1 million last year, an increase of 10.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.6% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 46.8% last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 45.7% for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, 46.1% for First Aid and Safety Services, 47.5% for Fire Safety Services, and 39.3% for Uniform Direct Sale.  Operating income of $404.4 million, compared to $356.4 million last year, an increase of 13.5%. Operating income margin was 19.5%, compared to 19.4% reported last year, a 10 basis point increase. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.8%, compared to 19.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the fourth quarter was $294.5 million, compared to $267.7 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.81, compared to $2.47 last year, an increase of 13.8%. Note that the higher effective tax rate in this year's fourth quarter was a 500 basis point headwind to the EPS growth rate and a $0.12 headwind to EPS. For our fiscal year 2023, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $8.47 billion to $8.58 billion, an increase of 7.8% to 9.2% over fiscal 2022. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $11.90 to $12.30. Please note the following: Fiscal 2022 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and a gain on an equity investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items fiscal 2022 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7%, and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal 2023 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.68 billion to $1.73 billion, compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains. Fiscal 2023 interest expense is expected to be approximately $110 million, compared to $88.8 million in fiscal 2022 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. The expected higher effective tax rate will negatively impact fiscal 2023 diluted EPS by approximately $0.32 per share and diluted EPS growth by approximately 290 basis points.  Our financial guidance includes share buybacks through July 13, 2022, but does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. And we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul.\nPaul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Darren, I'll turn it over to you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. I guess my first question is just around, you mentioned that your guidance contemplates a stable economic environment and does not contemplate any economic downturn. Could you maybe talk to us more about that? I know that historically you've outperformed the economy, but to the extent as you know there are a lot of concerns around the potential recession in the United States and globally, could you maybe talk a little bit about how your outlook may change to the extent that we run into an economic downturn?\nTodd Schneider: Certainly, Faiza. Thank you for the question and good morning. When we think about our guidance for next year, for fiscal 2023, we like our momentum. We like where we are through this point in our fiscal year. We like our sales productivity. We like our leverage that we think we're getting. And we are not trying to predict the next recession and certainly not the depth or breadth of that recession. In many ways I hope that my customers don't read the newspaper or look at \u2013 I ever listened to the news because, yes, what you hear, they're certainly scattered approaches out there, but what I can tell you is, we like what we're seeing in our business. We like the momentum that we're seeing in our business. And if a recession occurs, a downturn occurs, then we will manage it appropriately, which we have always done and we'll continue to do so. And we're quite confident in our ability to do so and we remain poised and we're watching it very closely.\nFaiza Alwy: Excellent. Just as a follow-up, could you talk about energy costs? As you know, there's been quite a bit of volatility as it relates to oil prices. You've historically disclosed, sort of how much energy impacted your margins. Maybe could you just talk to us about what the impact was this quarter and what you're anticipating for 2023?\nMike Hansen: Sure, Faiza. Our fourth quarter energy for the total company was 2.5%, that's up 40 basis points from a year ago. In our rental segment, energy was up 50 basis points. So, just a little bit more in that business. Our expectation is, on the whole, fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, we're going to see an increase of call it 20 basis points to 30 basis points. We certainly have seen the energy high in June in the first part of our quarter here, but it's nice to see that the price of the pumps come down just a little bit in the last couple of weeks. And our expectation is that it's not going to stay at this elevated level, but certainly higher than our fiscal 2022 year.\nFaiza Alwy: Understood. Thank you so much.\nMike Hansen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nHamzah Mazari: Hi, good morning. My first question is just around labor challenges, labor availability, could you give us a sense of how much demand could you not meet because labor was an issue? And is that fair? Was there demand out there that you couldn't meet because of labor challenges? And if so, what would the growth have been if labor wasn't an issue? And do you see labor normalizing at some point? Do you have some ability into that? Any thoughts there?\nTodd Schneider: Hamzah, it is \u2013 thank you for your question, it is certainly a challenging environment on the labor side. But I'm quite happy where we are staffed and our team has done an incredible job in managing through that process. The demand for our customers as you can see is quite robust and we're meeting that demand. And so it wouldn't be popular here if someone said that, hey, I can't meet the demand, so my revenues aren't going to be as good. That's not how we run our business. And we're proud of the fact that we're staffed well. We've got a really great team that is meeting the customers' needs and exceeding them. And as far as labor in the future, that's a tough one, but you would think that it might be easing a bit, but we're really not seeing it. It\u2019s trying to attract and retain and develop really good people is challenging today as I can ever remember in my career, but when things are really hard like that, we think it gives us a chance to shine. And I think we're doing just exactly that.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question is just around M&A. Clearly, balance sheet is under levered. Clearly, you bought a lot of stock back and continue to \u2013 are valuations just too high or were you looking for a larger deal that, sort of didn't pan out, just sort of any thoughts there? I know one of your competitors is spinning off their business and I know you don't comment specifically on M&A, but maybe just thoughts on M&A environment, what you're seeing there? Have valuations come in with the market coming in, and with some of the labor challenges, maybe private operators are more in distress than your business?\nTodd Schneider: Great question. We don't comment specifically on M&A, but what I can tell you is this that we are actively pursuing deals of all shapes and sizes. And certainly, valuations matter certainly. But it really takes two to dance. And we got to find \u2013 the right situation has to occur for [indiscernible] of an organization \u2013 shareholders of an organization to be willing sellers. And that tends to pace it more than anything. As you mentioned correctly, our balance sheet, we love our position and we're ready, willing and able to make deals of all shapes and sizes.\nHamzah Mazari: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you provide an update on how customer purchasing behaviors have changed in the current environment? How have ad stops in cross-selling evolved among your customer base?\nTodd Schneider: George, the current customer penetration, the current customer buying patterns have been good. As you can see in our revenue, over the course of the year, our revenue has accelerated each quarter and that's due in part because of really good new business, but our existing customers and the penetration we're seeing at those customers has gone very well and that certainly has been a part of the contribution of the accelerating growth. Todd mentioned, we love our momentum as you can certainly see through the quarterly growth throughout this year and a pretty good guide. And we just \u2013 we haven't seen a change in their behavior. Our value propositions that Todd talked about in our script and the outsourcing needs and the difficulties that are facing businesses because of the labor challenges that they're facing, it has resonated. Our value has resonated really well with those customers. And so the outsourcing has been good. So, all-in-all, George, we like the momentum and the performance of those existing customers has been really good.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. Thank you. And then with respect to pricing trends, can you talk a little bit about how that's also changed in the current environment? And if your latest pricing increases are fully offsetting input cost inflation or more than offsetting input cost inflation?\nMike Hansen: George, great question. As I mentioned earlier, it's a very challenging environment. We've said all along that we're not immune from inflation, but we really like our plan and our investments. And clearly, pricing is a component of our strategy. It has to be \u2013 input costs are significant because specifically labor and material costs, but we think we're doing a great job with that. Our price adjustments are certainly above historical as they need to be to address the costs that are coming through organization. We've done a really nice job of leveraging SG&A to provide us room to invest in other areas where we've had to add people and certainly labor rates etcetera, but it's working nicely. And part of our focus, a big part of our focus is we are looking at customers from a long-term standpoint and saying, yes, we have to adjust price and it will be above historical. However, we are going to find a way to grow margins and do so in ways other than just pricing. And we're doing that in certainly many key initiatives to help improve and find efficiencies in our business. So, you didn't ask specifically about that, but I think that's what you're getting at. And I'll just provide a little bit more color on that because I think it might be helpful for folks to understand that as we take this long term approach with customers, we'll adjust price, but we're going to go find efficiencies so that we can still improve our business and improve margins. I mentioned in our script and by the way most of this, of our efficiencies are tied to SAP and our digital transformation. SAP is the backbone of how we run our business and how we find \u2013 how we're able to enjoy the digital transformation that we're experiencing and our customers are experiencing as well. So just bear with me. I'll walk through a few of these for some color. I mentioned [in] [ph] My Cintas online portal, which \u2013 it provides us really nice leverage. It provides us improved revenue via sales and retention because customers value the ability to manage their program and pay their bills on their time, not just when our office is available. So that's great, but it also provides us some improved productivity because it allows customers to self-serve instead of our partners having to take care of that as well. I mentioned in the script as well, our Smart Truck technology, which is proprietary routing technology, it allows for more efficient routing and tracking of our vehicles. Where does this help us? It helps us and provides us more time that we can spend with customers instead of driving. That's more productivity. It provides real time tracking to assist with customer needs. It helps us reduce idle times, which is obviously important to us. Lower fuel consumption and obviously lower GHG emissions as a result. And in fact, over the last three quarters within our rental division, our distance between customers has reduced 5%, which is just \u2013 it's just finding an efficiency in our business by leveraging technology and because driving, as we've always said, when the wheels are moving, we don't generate any revenue, it\u2019s when we\u2019ll stop.  So that's important to us. And then, we also have something that we've rolled out through our technology transformation or digital transformation. What we call our operational excellence dashboards, which allows for us the ability to evaluate our production facilities, our plans to see how they're performing without having to be at each plant physically to evaluate performance. So, in the past, you had to be at a plant to see how they were performing and were they on time and were turn times in our washout. We track everything. And now we have technology that allows us to do that. And so it's all driven because of our SAP platform. Many of this, it ends up showing up in faster turnaround of product, better utilization of in service inventory, which helps offset purchases. It's been significant for us. And I thought I'd just provide a little color because I thought it might help you as you think about pricing and how we're fighting inflation.\nGeorge Tong: That's very helpful color. Thank you very much.\nMike Hansen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the healthcare, government and education vertical, those three key verticals that were a key area of focus. How's the progress on that front? And then maybe a more broader question is around the economic sensitivity of your end market. Just wanted to follow-up on the earlier question like how much of the revenues really generated from more sensitive end market versus more recession resilient end markets? Any color on that front will be helpful. Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Ashish, thanks for the question. Our verticals are quite robust. We've invested significantly there. And we look at those as businesses. How we operate the products, the services that we're providing the tools to our partners, and that provides us advantages in the marketplace and helps us \u2013 positions us to provide better services to our customers, which is important to us. And certainly, the education sectors had \u2013 the last two years have been a bit bumpy for them. It seems like they're meaning with closures and what have you that appears to be behind them hopefully. The government sector has been very consistent for us. Hospitality, as you read, has been quite robust and continues the demand and the hospitality sector seems to be quite good. And when we think about our Fortune 1000 and corporate accounts sectors, our customers seem to be doing quite well and trying to see into the future and see what will occur. Is the recession imminent? Are we in one? Is it going to be next year? Here I can tell you is, our value proposition, what Mike spoke about of \u2013 the items that we provide are important to people, provides compliance and sanitization, image, health, wellness, those things are very important. And then, when you combine that with the fact that it's \u2013 there's still over 11 million job openings in the country. And as a result, it's tough for our customers to hire and train and keep their people and they're looking to us to outsource items. And we're in a great position to take that on and we're happy to take that on and help them with those functions.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe just a quick one on the follow-up on the healthcare. I know the last disclosure was I think almost 7% of the revenue with the opportunity to be 10% of the revenue in the mid-term. I was wondering if it's possible to provide any update on that front, particularly on the healthcare side?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. The healthcare has been an absolute great vertical for us. It's a very important one. It's our largest vertical, as we look at the opportunities still \u2013 it\u2019s still under 10%. We see an amazing runway there. And big items in the future when you think over the coming years, because again, we're organized appropriately to meet the needs of those customers. We know them really well and we listen to what their needs are. And we're addressing them and continuing to invest in technology that will help them to be more successful to help them run a better business and we're quite bullish on that vertical.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great. Congrats on the strong momentum in the business.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Andy Wittmann from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndy Wittmann: Hi, great. Thanks. I was just wondering if, as you look back at the fact that you grew margins during COVID, so recently just a couple of years ago, does that limit any flexibility that you have on your margins or excuse me, on your P&L, if we were to head into the next recession? \nMike Hansen: Andy, thanks for the question. It depends upon the when, how long, how deep that recession is and that's for others to try to forecast. But we see \u2013 fortunately, we have plenty of runway on finding efficiencies in our business. When we think about the value that we're providing our customers, you know when our customers are healthy, our business is that much better, but we will fight through whatever recession comes our way. We've done that and we've shown the ability to gross sales and profits in, I'd say, just about every operating environment out there. 51 of the past 53 years, the exception being the 2008, 2009. I certainly hope that it's not that deep, [nasty] [ph] for recession, whatever comes next, but we'll be prepared to manage through that as you've seen us do over the years.\nTodd Schneider: Andy, I might just add, you know we certainly adjusted at the beginning of the pandemic our cost structure and we're able to pull costs out, but as you can imagine for the last, I'll call it, five quarters, our revenue growth has been really solid and accelerating, and so along the way, there have been investments that have been necessary and investments that we've wanted to make, and that means we've added growth routes back that we took out in the early days of the pandemic. We've added capacity in our production facilities to handle this great volume growth that we've had. And so, we've got this investment going on right now. And as Todd said, look, if the environment changes and we need to pivot you've seen us pivot pretty effectively certainly in the last few years and we'll do that again if the economic situation requires us to do so.\nAndy Wittmann: That's helpful color. Mike, I just, I don't usually ask about the all other segment, but there was a big number on the direct sale. I think you said plus 53% year-over-year. Obviously, comps were relatively easy, but was that just a program that was contained in the quarter or do you \u2013 is there something changed in the outlook that could either flow into 1Q or more sustainably change in how that business is going to market or how customers are reacting?\nMike Hansen: Great. Thank you, Andy. And the partners in that area, thank you for asking about it as well. As you know, that can be a little bit more spiky, the direct sale business, but the comps were easier, but nevertheless, we like the momentum we have in that business. We've diversified our customer base. We're selling to a broader area. We've got nice position in that market. And yes, we like where we are. Now, certainly comps will get tougher next year. So, even more so in the back half of the year, not just for that business, but all of our businesses. But we really like the momentum and the position in the marketplace in that business.\nAndy Wittmann: Great. Thanks guys.\nMike Hansen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Todd, thank you earlier for all those kind of productive examples we talked about. And despite the high inflation environment, you guys have one of the few companies that are showing margin expansion. And so, I was hoping that maybe you or Mike could remind us of the big cost buckets and how you are being able to manage through [differentiation the environment] [ph] to show this margin expansion and how perhaps sustainable it could be?\nMike Hansen: Sure Manav, certainly when you think about the cost structure and I'll speak mostly to our rental business. Certainly, labor is an important bucket for us. And as you've heard Todd explain over the last four quarters or so, we've worked really hard over the last several years to improve the \u2013 or increase the rates at higher than I'll say historical averages and that left us not flat footed in this challenging environment and it's allowed us to continue to raise, but not in an alarming rate that maybe some of our other competitors have had to do. And we'll continue to manage that very, very appropriately. The other bucket that I'll mention is, our material costs. Certainly material cost is a big component. And as you know, we are able to amortize the rental items. So, the items that we are reusing in the business in a recurring nature garments, dust mats, mops, etcetera, shop towels. And so, we're able to amortize those and so we don't get inflation impact immediately. This amortization allows us to understand what's coming and it allows us to anticipate and that allows our global supply chain to flex when we need to, to change volumes around. And that's very important for us to be able to see ahead, and the other thing it allows us to do, it allows us to potentially get a couple of price increases in, before that, I'll say higher cost even hits our P&L. So for example, when we have \u2013 if we have cost increases in our materials, and we amortize those over 18 months. That first high \u2013 that first months of higher cost, we have [one-eighteenth] [ph] of it. The second month, we get [two-eighteenth] [ph] of it. So, it doesn't fully hit our P&L for eighteen months. We can adapt, make decisions, including pricing decisions before that fully hits us. So, we have this, we've got this nice, I'll call it, hedge in that part of the cost structure and that certainly is an important part of our cost structure. And the other thing I'll say is, certainly we've got some infrastructure and we can leverage that infrastructure pretty well with revenue growth like we've got it today and the momentum. And so, we've been able to manage all of those buckets in different ways, but quite appropriately. And then when you couple of those \u2013 the way we manage those different buckets with the initiatives that Todd spoke of to get efficiencies, labor efficiencies, productivity improvements, technology improvements, those things can really help us as we face inflation and as Todd laid out, we've got a pretty good game plan against it. As you've seen, we've in this year just ended, in a pretty difficult inflationary environment, we were able to raise our operating margins 50 basis points.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you, Mike. Yes, I think that's very helpful. We get a lot of this question. Just as a follow-up, the 164 million that you spent on the deals, can you just give us a flavor of, kind of where, how many, the size of those deals and perhaps what that small tuck-in pipeline looks like?\nTodd Schneider: Sure. We're always working that pipeline and we've made some very nice deals in our rental segment this year. We also certainly made some very nice deals in our first-aid and fire businesses as well. And then we had the equity investment that we effectively bought out and that is more of a global supply chain impacting acquisition. But we like all of them and they have certainly provided some nice synergies in a tuck-in nature for the year. And we'll continue to work on those as we move forward. We think the pipeline is good.\nManav Patnaik: All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. Two questions. The first one is, in the 2023 revenue guide that you gave percentages in dollars, could you just also give that in terms of the percentages in organic constant currency numbers as well? Because I assume FX makes difference and M&A might have [a some needle moving] [ph]. And the second question, I just want to hear more about your First Aid business, like particularly the Cabinets business? Like what percentage of First Aid is in Cabinets now versus pre-COVID? How fast is your Cabinets business growing and then you also introduced a new product COVID testing and \u2013 COVID test kits, and how is that going?\nMike Hansen: Sure. Andrew, I'll tackle the first part and turn the First Aid question over to Todd. So, as it relates to our revenue guidance, 7.8% on the low-end, 9.2% on the high-end. In the fourth quarter, we had 30 basis points of organic benefit and FX impact. I would expect that we'll see that continue for let's call it the first half of the year. And depending on then the acquisitions that we make in fiscal 2023, we may see that continue, but any future acquisitions are not baked into those numbers.  So, call it the first half of the year we\u2019ll continue with something in the way of 20 basis points to 30 basis points of M&A and FX. And that's probably going to decrease then without any new M&A activity in the back half of the year. Does that answer your question Andrew?\nAndrew Steinerman: Yes.\nMike Hansen: Okay. And then Todd, I'll turn it over to you for the first aid.\nTodd Schneider: Great. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Yes, our \u2013 certainly as a percent \u2013 our first aid cabinets dropped during the COVID, but it's coming back and coming back quite nicely. In fact, it grew 25%, our first aid cabinet business did in Q4 and that's very, very encouraging. And it's showing up in our margins as well. So, we will continue to be opportunistic in helping customers with the breadth of our offering. Certainly don't know exactly what COVID will bring this fall, but we're focused on growing our first aid business in helping all of our customers in that area. If that means they need COVID test kits, we'll help them if they need masks, we\u2019ll help them. You name it. But our focus is on trying to make sure that we're growing that profitable consistent first aid cabinet business and we're very encouraged by the trends.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you very much.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSeth Weber: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Mike, can you just talk about \u2013 I mean, the free cash flow is really strong here. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about CapEx going forward? And just talk maybe, give us a sense for kind of where you're at from a capacity utilization perspective and whether you have enough capacity or CapEx needs to go higher from here? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Sure. Yes, Seth. Our free cash flow has been good. Our expectation is that that's not going to change in this upcoming fiscal 2023 year. Our CapEx look, we expect it to be in the 3% to 3.5% of revenue type of a range. If you look over the last 10 years, that's maybe a little bit down from where we've been, but we're going to keep investing in the business. As it relates to our capacity, we have had some really good growth this year. And there are spots where we've had to add capacity, but generally speaking, I don't expect that we'll have significant and I'll say lumped together type of capacity investments that will happen over time as we continue to grow. So, our expectation is our good and healthy free cash flow will continue in fiscal 2023.\nTodd Schneider: Seth, as I spoke about it earlier, one of the items that we're focused on is, making sure that we leverage our infrastructure to its fullest whether that be our fleet, but also our production facilities. And as I mentioned, our operating excellence technology platform is helping us to make sure we're finding all the efficiencies in our business and in certain cases that's allowing us to forgo CapEx as a result because we're able to find efficiencies in running our business and our production facilities as well. And we'll continue to do that as the very best we can.\nSeth Weber: Okay, thanks. And then maybe just on the fire business, can you just give us a little bit of color what's driving the strength there, double-digit revenue strength seems \u2013 it's been double-digits for a while now and is that just you're taking share from smaller operators? Is that where some of the inorganic growth is coming from? Just any color on how that business is being sustained at this kind of double-digit level?\nTodd Schneider: Sure, Seth. We really like the fire business. We have a very good team that's operating and selling into our customer base. The uniqueness about the fire customers is there really is no program market, right. Everybody is served, they're served in some manner, but we've invested in that business to make sure that we are positioned with the best people, the best technology that we are continuing to invest in there and the best training and one that really \u2013 we like our spot there from \u2013 the levels of service that we're providing our customers and it's getting noticed. And that's a business that you want to feel good about who's walking in your facility and who's taking care of you. And we think that we're well-positioned. So, good momentum in that business and we're focused on continuing that momentum.\nSeth Weber: Okay, guys. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I want to piggyback on some of the questions regarding just business risk in a tougher macro environment if we do see one. Can you just talk at a high level how your business has changed say over the last decade since last economic recession through non-COVID? In terms of cyclicality, do you think from an end customer perspective in the verticals you operate or from a product perspective where you think you're better positioned today than you may have been a decade ago? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Sure, Heather. I'll say a couple of things. We've got first of all great momentum in the business and we love the value that we're providing our customers and the outsourcing that is needed in this challenging time is really resonating and working well for us. So that's really important for us in any turn in the economy we like our momentum. That's important. I would say, if you think about the last 10 years, our growth has been in multiples above GDP and why is that? And multiples above employment growth. And why is that? It's because we're able to sell number one to many what we call in the industry no programmers. So those that don't have a current recurring program. And that's important because in any kind of environment, we go to prospects and existing customers and when we sell the value, usually it's for things that they're already spending money on. And so we're not necessarily asking them to spend new money, we're asking them to spend money with us while we take work content away from them. So, for example, we don't want you to do things, we don't want our customers to do it all themselves. That takes time, capacity, labor, etcetera. We want to help them do it. And so as we take that work content away from them, again in any type of environment that's helpful, but certainly in one where businesses are feeling the pressure of an economy that can really resonate and help. So, we like the way that our value is working. And in the past, we've really been able to grow when there hasn't been much economic growth or employment growth. And our expectation is, we'll continue to be able to do that. 60% of our new business comes from those no programmers. The other thing is, look, we've got a different kind of sales force today than we did at 10, 12 years ago and that sales force is really dialed in on finding those no programmers, finding the business and also penetrating more and our penetration has worked very well. But that sales team is also focused on different verticals that we were walking by in the last recession. And those verticals like healthcare can be a little bit less impacted by recessions and that's good for us. So, we like the diversity in our customer base that we've created over the course of the last 10 years. We think moving forward that diversity is going to help us as we move forward. In addition to that, look, we're going to continue to look for M&A opportunities and we're going to look for \u2013 continue to look for efficiency opportunities and those will help protect us in the next downturn. We can't predict when it may happen. If it's happening, we can't predict how long, how deep, how broad it's going to be. but we like where we are today with momentum and a value proposition that is resonating better than ever. And as you've seen Heather over the course of the last few years, if we need to pivot, we've shown that we can pivot and pivot appropriately to match the environment.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you, appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Mike, sorry if I missed this, but in the fourth quarter, you usually give the mix between rental sub segments, the shop towels, hygiene, etcetera. Can you give us an updated breakdown there?\nPaul Adler: Hey, Tony, it's Paul. I do have that information and this is just that Uniform Rental and Facility Services segments measured on Q4's activity. Uniform Rental, which is the workwear that we [rent, car hard] [ph], the healthcare scrubs are in there, that was 48% of the mix. Dust, which is the mats, the mops, similar cleaning tools 18%, hygiene at 17%, shop towels 4%, linens, which are typically apron's, towels, things that don't run through a flat iron machine that's 9% of the mix and then catalog revenue was about 4%. And those percentages are very similar to last year, which I think speaks to the continued strong demand that we have for all the products and services within that segment.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. And just sort of on this in similar lines, if you think about upselling within Uniform Rental, what are the real, sort of new products that people are demanding? What are \u2013 obviously in terms of cross-sell, we've seen a lot of success from the sanitizers and the COVID test kits and things like that, but when you look really specifically within rental what are, sort of the new upselling opportunities that you're seeing the most success in?\nTodd Schneider: Toni, within rental, we're seeing quite strong demand for all of our products and services and we really don't care where it starts as far as what we sell into a customer first because we have such a broad offering that we'll \u2013 whatever they're interested in, we'll help provide and then we'll continue to provide additional offerings to them. And \u2013 but when you think about it, right, it's a tough environment to hire and retain people, providing a benefit of workwear and laundering of workwear, that's a nice benefit for people and helps to attract and retain people. When you think about \u2013 if you're interested in our [restroom items] [ph], when it's hard to \u2013 when you're busy and you're trying to run a business, trying to deal with those items is something you'd rather \u2013 you'd love to outsource. And as I mentioned earlier, we're able to do it better, faster, cheaper, all that than what they can do for themselves. And in many of those cases, we're not even asking for additional spend. It's just a reallocated spend to us. So, whether that's \u2013 we have such a broad customer base. It depends, but I'm speaking more generically of you've got [restaurants] [ph], you've got people, you need products and services to help prepare your facility for either your customers, your guests, your employees, patients maybe. And so all of that is in very nice demand. And certainly, the focus on health, wellness, cleanliness, safety is more so today than it was a few years ago, which we think is that is positive for our business.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Todd, I'm going to start with a question for you. Given the breadth of your business with like a million clients, you have kind of unique insight into [Main Street Americas] [ph], what is the sentiment amongst your clients and in terms of they're running their businesses and what you're thinking? What are you hearing from the salespeople? Are they leading back to the same kind of fear that we're seeing in the headlines of the newspapers and what the stock market seems to be indicating or is it really not that way? Is there kind of a disparity between the headlines and what you're actually seeing on the street from your view?\nTodd Schneider: Shlomo, great question. You're right. We have such a broad and diverse customer base. We're up and down Main Street, U.S.A. every single day. And we're watching it really closely. And it seems as though demand is quite strong. Their demand within their business, demand for our products and services. As I mentioned earlier, I hope \u2013 I think we'd all be better off if nobody read the news or listened to the news because it seems like we're trying to talk ourselves into it, but that being said, we're watching it really, really closely because as Mike mentioned, we'll pivot. We'll pivot appropriately. But to date, it appears as though Main Street, U.S.A. is doing just fine and we're encouraged by that.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you. And then, hey, Mike, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the dispersion of costs across the business units. The margin expansion was really pronounced in the First Aid and Safety and Other and then kind of the Rental Uniforms saw the margin come down, do they have just much more significant energy and labor aspect to it or maybe you can kind of explain that to us?\nMike Hansen: Sure. Certainly, the rental business is more affected by energy than the other businesses, no question about it. We had really nice quarters in our First Aid business as you point out. And what you're seeing there is that cabinet growth that we talked about earlier in the call being 25% plus and that getting back to mix that we love. And so, we've \u2013 our First Aid team has really done a nice job of getting that \u2013 working on that mix and getting it back to the, I'll say, pre-pandemic type of mix closer to that kind of mix. So, really good mix shift and momentum in that business. Our fire and Uniform Direct Sale businesses margins are certainly benefiting from the great top line improvement. We're getting great leverage. They're not \u2013 that all other is not affected by the energy in the same way that rental is. And we're able to see some superb productivity out of that group too. So, we really like that momentum. On the rental side, we like where the business is and we've been investing in that business for the growth that we've seen in terms of an acceleration throughout the year. And look, operating a business isn't always a linear \u2013 perfect linear function. And that means there are times when there's a little bit more investment in some quarters, not as much in others. And look, overall, we love the trajectory of the rental business. We have certainly added some of those growth routes that I mentioned earlier, some capacity in the production facilities, but we like where the momentum is going in all of those businesses, but it's not a perfectly linear type of a thing to operate a business.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Sure. Just to clarify, in the focus in that the rental side, I guess the obvious answer would be, oh, you're seeing inflationary costs and that's what's kind of hitting that number, but I want to just kind of third out what you're saying over here that is there a heavier [weighting] [ph] of investment in the last quarter or some of the things exactly what you're saying. It may not be linear and it's not really the inflation that might be hitting you guys, but the fact that you're deciding to [continue it] [ph] invested this period?\nTodd Schneider: Well, I mean, look, the way that we typically invest is over time and as we need it and it's generally incremental. And in this particular case in the rental business, we've been investing all year. And sometimes, we're running up against a pretty high comp in last year's fourth quarter. And look, it's \u2013 I wouldn't say it's an overinvestment or that we underinvested in the past, it's just simply that we are investing in the way that we appropriately need to and some of that is a little bit more labor over the course of this year where we're lapping a year fiscal 2021 that was, you know it's significantly impacted by the pandemic. And as we've gotten into fiscal 2022, as we've accelerated our growth, we need capacity in order to grow. I think Hamzah may have asked a question earlier about are we able to find the labor that we need in order to continue to grow? And Todd answered, yes. And that investment is necessary, but it's important for us, especially in the long-term view that we have and that Todd talked about earlier.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take a question from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Looks like we're getting near the end here. So, I just have one, but there's a few parts to it, mostly modeling. So Mike, probably for you. Kind of a summary question, on operating margin, the guidance implies after a very good year of expansion in 2022, more expansion at the midpoint in 2023. What are the one or two things that you really worry about that could push you to the low end of the range? And then what are the couple items that could push you above? And then the latter part of this question is, cadence of operating margin into fiscal 2023, how comfortable are you and where are you thinking about for the first half of the year? And then kind of you talked about higher interest expense, what do you think the cadence is of that and maybe some color on the tax rate? Thanks for [indiscernible] all that at once.\nMike Hansen: Sure. I'll do my best. Yes, the guide that we provided provides for operating income growth of 8.6% at the low, 12% at the high, when we're comparing to that adjusted [2022] [ph] operating income. What can take us to the low \u2013 I don't, I don't \u2013 we don't mean to be overconfident, but I would say that the things that concern us most are certainly the macro and what happens that's outside of our control. Right now, we really like the way the prospects and the customers view our value. Our sales productivity numbers are really high. And I think it's more about the macro for us. And certainly, we're not trying to time or predict a recession and our numbers don't necessarily incorporate a recession, but there's a little bit of economic movement that certainly can happen that may move us towards the low end of that range. If we don't see any economic slowdown, we certainly, given the revenue momentum, we certainly could exceed the high-end. So, I would say, more than anything, it's about the macro and how does that impact us. From an interest perspective, look, the Fed is not finished and we do have some, albeit a fairly small amount, but we do have some variable interest, variable debt and the Fed is not finished. So, we may see a little bit of an impact as we go through the year, but on the other hand, we generate a lot of cash. I talked about our free cash flow a little bit earlier and if we feel like we have available cash, we'll certainly pay down some variable debt. So, I would say the 110 that we gave in the guide is a reasonable number and I wouldn't expect that to move too much unless we did something with the use of our cash potentially in M&A, otherwise, I think that 110 is a fairly solid type of a number. From a tax rate perspective, look, it's hard to predict what's going to happen in the stock market. It's hard to predict based on the stock market movement how much we may see in the way of exercises of our stock options, etcetera, those things can have an impact on our tax rate. And so it's hard to predict where we're going to be, but that 20% that we're in the guide, I think that's a reasonable place for us and what would take to move that down, it would take a more significant amount of stock options being exercised than we're expecting or it certainly could be other discrete events that happen that we're not expecting, but I think the 20% is a fairly good guide again based on what we're seeing today.\nScott Schneeberger: Great, great job answering that. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further time. So, I'll hand the call back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nTodd Schneider: Well, thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter of fiscal 2023 financial results in September. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Schneider",
            "content": "Thank you Paul. Our fourth quarter financial results are led by a strong revenue increase of 13.0% to $2.07 billion. Despite strong inflationary headwinds, operating income margin increased 10 basis points to 19.5% and EPS grew 13.8% to $2.81. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing base. Businesses prioritize, [all we] [ph] provide including image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. Challenge was finding labor to run their business, heighten concerns over sanitization and the inflationary labor and purchasing costs, businesses increasingly outsourced to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. We were able to deliver increased operating margin and EPS despite this period of significant inflation by productively selling new business, penetrating existing customers with more products and services, providing excellent service while driving operational efficiencies and obtaining incremental price increases from our customer base. Fourth quarter free cash flow increased 15.2% from last year. On June 15, we paid shareholders $98.2 million in quarterly dividends. And during the fourth quarter and through July 13, 2022, we purchased $496.5 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder returns. We are pleased with our fourth quarter financial results. They conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following: Fiscal year 2022 revenue was a record $7.85 billion, an increase of 10.4%. The organic revenue growth rate was 10.2%. Excluding two gains recorded this fiscal year and one recorded last fiscal year, operating income margin increased 50 basis points to 19.7%. We allocated capital to improve shareholder return. Acquisition spend was $164.2 million. In fiscal 2022 and up until today, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of Cintas stock for a total of $1.62 billion. Also, we increased the dividend 26.7%. We have increased the dividend every year since going public, which is 38 consecutive years. We made significant progress on our digital transformation journey. Our customers continue to find [added value] [ph] in managing their program through our online solution. We expect the ease of doing business with us to drive greater customer retention and faster revenue realization. We are actively using our new rolled out proprietary routing technology, which we call Smart Truck. This technology helps us make smarter routing decisions, enabling us to spend more time with our customers on service and sales, and also allows us to reduce energy usage and expense by driving fewer miles. We also made great strides in data analytics and enhanced business reporting, helping us target penetration, cross-selling, operational efficiencies, and pricing opportunities. In addition, as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our second environmental social and governance or ESG report. It's a more robust report. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. With this in mind, we announced our ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. And finally, our actions are being recognized. We were again named to the prestigious Fortune 500. It's an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We were also recently added to the FTSE4Good Index Series. The Index Series includes companies demonstrating strong ESG practices. I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Cintas has grown revenue and adjusted EPS in 51 of the past 53 years. And our prospects for continued profitable growth are great. They result in part from a strong value proposition and a vast total addressable market. Every business, goods producing or services providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance. Operating a business is increasingly complex. Rather than doing it themselves, businesses increasingly outsource to Cintas. We provide the products and perform the services better, faster, and economically [frame businesses] [ph] to concentrate on their core competency. Since every business has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance, our total addressable market is vast. The prospects for Uniform or workwear rental are significant. The unserved workwear rental market is tremendous. Tens of billions of dollars of workwear are sold by retailers each year to workers in every sector of the economy. There are millions of people in healthcare alone, hospitals, urgent care, doctors office, dentists offices, and long-term care going to work every day in shrubs purchased from retailers. We focus on targeting these retail customers converting them to a rental program. The fact that consistently 60% of our new customers are converted from retail to a rental program speaks to the size of the opportunity, as well as our continued success. Plus, we are more than just a Uniform Rental company. More than half of our revenue is from facility services including hygiene, floor care items such as dust mats and mops, cleaning tools like microfiber mops and towels, first aid cabinet services, and fire protection services including test and inspection of extinguishers and alarms. Every business that has a door, floor, wall, bathroom, and employees is a sales prospect. Our organic revenue growth rates are indicative of our compelling value proposition and tremendous market size. We grow revenue in multiples of GDP and jobs growth because of ample supply and demand for our products and services. Our growth in revenue is profitable growth and our operating margins have a long runway for expansion. Growth results in more buying power with our suppliers. It produces operating leverage. Route density increases reducing energy expenses and providing more time to spend with customers on service and sales. Growth means more volume in the plants, covering fixed cost of building, machinery and equipment. And when we penetrate existing customers with more products and services, the incremental operating margins are even stronger because we realize more revenue per service step. The future of Cintas remains bright. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to provide the details of our fourth quarter results and our financial expectations for fiscal 2023. Certainly, Faiza. Thank you for the question and good morning. When we think about our guidance for next year, for fiscal 2023, we like our momentum. We like where we are through this point in our fiscal year. We like our sales productivity. We like our leverage that we think we're getting. And we are not trying to predict the next recession and certainly not the depth or breadth of that recession. In many ways I hope that my customers don't read the newspaper or look at \u2013 I ever listened to the news because, yes, what you hear, they're certainly scattered approaches out there, but what I can tell you is, we like what we're seeing in our business. We like the momentum that we're seeing in our business. And if a recession occurs, a downturn occurs, then we will manage it appropriately, which we have always done and we'll continue to do so. And we're quite confident in our ability to do so and we remain poised and we're watching it very closely. Hamzah, it is \u2013 thank you for your question, it is certainly a challenging environment on the labor side. But I'm quite happy where we are staffed and our team has done an incredible job in managing through that process. The demand for our customers as you can see is quite robust and we're meeting that demand. And so it wouldn't be popular here if someone said that, hey, I can't meet the demand, so my revenues aren't going to be as good. That's not how we run our business. And we're proud of the fact that we're staffed well. We've got a really great team that is meeting the customers' needs and exceeding them. And as far as labor in the future, that's a tough one, but you would think that it might be easing a bit, but we're really not seeing it. It's trying to attract and retain and develop really good people is challenging today as I can ever remember in my career, but when things are really hard like that, we think it gives us a chance to shine. And I think we're doing just exactly that. Great question. We don't comment specifically on M&A, but what I can tell you is this that we are actively pursuing deals of all shapes and sizes. And certainly, valuations matter certainly. But it really takes two to dance. And we got to find \u2013 the right situation has to occur for [indiscernible] of an organization \u2013 shareholders of an organization to be willing sellers. And that tends to pace it more than anything. As you mentioned correctly, our balance sheet, we love our position and we're ready, willing and able to make deals of all shapes and sizes. George, the current customer penetration, the current customer buying patterns have been good. As you can see in our revenue, over the course of the year, our revenue has accelerated each quarter and that's due in part because of really good new business, but our existing customers and the penetration we're seeing at those customers has gone very well and that certainly has been a part of the contribution of the accelerating growth. Todd mentioned, we love our momentum as you can certainly see through the quarterly growth throughout this year and a pretty good guide. And we just \u2013 we haven't seen a change in their behavior. Our value propositions that Todd talked about in our script and the outsourcing needs and the difficulties that are facing businesses because of the labor challenges that they're facing, it has resonated. Our value has resonated really well with those customers. And so the outsourcing has been good. So, all-in-all, George, we like the momentum and the performance of those existing customers has been really good. Ashish, thanks for the question. Our verticals are quite robust. We've invested significantly there. And we look at those as businesses. How we operate the products, the services that we're providing the tools to our partners, and that provides us advantages in the marketplace and helps us \u2013 positions us to provide better services to our customers, which is important to us. And certainly, the education sectors had \u2013 the last two years have been a bit bumpy for them. It seems like they're meaning with closures and what have you that appears to be behind them hopefully. The government sector has been very consistent for us. Hospitality, as you read, has been quite robust and continues the demand and the hospitality sector seems to be quite good. And when we think about our Fortune 1000 and corporate accounts sectors, our customers seem to be doing quite well and trying to see into the future and see what will occur. Is the recession imminent? Are we in one? Is it going to be next year? Here I can tell you is, our value proposition, what Mike spoke about of \u2013 the items that we provide are important to people, provides compliance and sanitization, image, health, wellness, those things are very important. And then, when you combine that with the fact that it's \u2013 there's still over 11 million job openings in the country. And as a result, it's tough for our customers to hire and train and keep their people and they're looking to us to outsource items. And we're in a great position to take that on and we're happy to take that on and help them with those functions. Yes. The healthcare has been an absolute great vertical for us. It's a very important one. It's our largest vertical, as we look at the opportunities still \u2013 it's still under 10%. We see an amazing runway there. And big items in the future when you think over the coming years, because again, we're organized appropriately to meet the needs of those customers. We know them really well and we listen to what their needs are. And we're addressing them and continuing to invest in technology that will help them to be more successful to help them run a better business and we're quite bullish on that vertical. Thank you. Andy, I might just add, you know we certainly adjusted at the beginning of the pandemic our cost structure and we're able to pull costs out, but as you can imagine for the last, I'll call it, five quarters, our revenue growth has been really solid and accelerating, and so along the way, there have been investments that have been necessary and investments that we've wanted to make, and that means we've added growth routes back that we took out in the early days of the pandemic. We've added capacity in our production facilities to handle this great volume growth that we've had. And so, we've got this investment going on right now. And as Todd said, look, if the environment changes and we need to pivot you've seen us pivot pretty effectively certainly in the last few years and we'll do that again if the economic situation requires us to do so. Sure. We're always working that pipeline and we've made some very nice deals in our rental segment this year. We also certainly made some very nice deals in our first-aid and fire businesses as well. And then we had the equity investment that we effectively bought out and that is more of a global supply chain impacting acquisition. But we like all of them and they have certainly provided some nice synergies in a tuck-in nature for the year. And we'll continue to work on those as we move forward. We think the pipeline is good. Great. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Yes, our \u2013 certainly as a percent \u2013 our first aid cabinets dropped during the COVID, but it's coming back and coming back quite nicely. In fact, it grew 25%, our first aid cabinet business did in Q4 and that's very, very encouraging. And it's showing up in our margins as well. So, we will continue to be opportunistic in helping customers with the breadth of our offering. Certainly don't know exactly what COVID will bring this fall, but we're focused on growing our first aid business in helping all of our customers in that area. If that means they need COVID test kits, we'll help them if they need masks, we'll help them. You name it. But our focus is on trying to make sure that we're growing that profitable consistent first aid cabinet business and we're very encouraged by the trends. Thank you. Seth, as I spoke about it earlier, one of the items that we're focused on is, making sure that we leverage our infrastructure to its fullest whether that be our fleet, but also our production facilities. And as I mentioned, our operating excellence technology platform is helping us to make sure we're finding all the efficiencies in our business and in certain cases that's allowing us to forgo CapEx as a result because we're able to find efficiencies in running our business and our production facilities as well. And we'll continue to do that as the very best we can. Sure, Seth. We really like the fire business. We have a very good team that's operating and selling into our customer base. The uniqueness about the fire customers is there really is no program market, right. Everybody is served, they're served in some manner, but we've invested in that business to make sure that we are positioned with the best people, the best technology that we are continuing to invest in there and the best training and one that really \u2013 we like our spot there from \u2013 the levels of service that we're providing our customers and it's getting noticed. And that's a business that you want to feel good about who's walking in your facility and who's taking care of you. And we think that we're well-positioned. So, good momentum in that business and we're focused on continuing that momentum. Toni, within rental, we're seeing quite strong demand for all of our products and services and we really don't care where it starts as far as what we sell into a customer first because we have such a broad offering that we'll \u2013 whatever they're interested in, we'll help provide and then we'll continue to provide additional offerings to them. And \u2013 but when you think about it, right, it's a tough environment to hire and retain people, providing a benefit of workwear and laundering of workwear, that's a nice benefit for people and helps to attract and retain people. When you think about \u2013 if you're interested in our [restroom items] [ph], when it's hard to \u2013 when you're busy and you're trying to run a business, trying to deal with those items is something you'd rather \u2013 you'd love to outsource. And as I mentioned earlier, we're able to do it better, faster, cheaper, all that than what they can do for themselves. And in many of those cases, we're not even asking for additional spend. It's just a reallocated spend to us. So, whether that's \u2013 we have such a broad customer base. It depends, but I'm speaking more generically of you've got [restaurants] [ph], you've got people, you need products and services to help prepare your facility for either your customers, your guests, your employees, patients maybe. And so all of that is in very nice demand. And certainly, the focus on health, wellness, cleanliness, safety is more so today than it was a few years ago, which we think is that is positive for our business. Thank you. Shlomo, great question. You're right. We have such a broad and diverse customer base. We're up and down Main Street, U.S.A. every single day. And we're watching it really closely. And it seems as though demand is quite strong. Their demand within their business, demand for our products and services. As I mentioned earlier, I hope \u2013 I think we'd all be better off if nobody read the news or listened to the news because it seems like we're trying to talk ourselves into it, but that being said, we're watching it really, really closely because as Mike mentioned, we'll pivot. We'll pivot appropriately. But to date, it appears as though Main Street, U.S.A. is doing just fine and we're encouraged by that. Well, I mean, look, the way that we typically invest is over time and as we need it and it's generally incremental. And in this particular case in the rental business, we've been investing all year. And sometimes, we're running up against a pretty high comp in last year's fourth quarter. And look, it's \u2013 I wouldn't say it's an overinvestment or that we underinvested in the past, it's just simply that we are investing in the way that we appropriately need to and some of that is a little bit more labor over the course of this year where we're lapping a year fiscal 2021 that was, you know it's significantly impacted by the pandemic. And as we've gotten into fiscal 2022, as we've accelerated our growth, we need capacity in order to grow. I think Hamzah may have asked a question earlier about are we able to find the labor that we need in order to continue to grow? And Todd answered, yes. And that investment is necessary, but it's important for us, especially in the long-term view that we have and that Todd talked about earlier. Well, thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter of fiscal 2023 financial results in September. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you."

That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Darren, I'll turn it over to you. Hey, Tony, it's Paul. I do have that information and this is just that Uniform Rental and Facility Services segments measured on Q4's activity. Uniform Rental, which is the workwear that we [rent, car hard] [ph], the healthcare scrubs are in there, that was 48% of the mix. Dust, which is the mats, the mops, similar cleaning tools 18%, hygiene at 17%, shop towels 4%, linens, which are typically apron's, towels, things that don't run through a flat iron machine that's 9% of the mix and then catalog revenue was about 4%. And those percentages are very similar to last year, which I think speaks to the continued strong demand that we have for all the products and services within that segment."

            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter revenue of $2.07 billion compares to $1.84 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 12.7%. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $1.63 billion, compared to $1.47 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 10.5%. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $218.2 million, compared to $186.9 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 15.1%. This strong growth rate reflects the growing momentum of our First Aid Cabinet business, which grew 25% in the fourth quarter. While personal protective equipment remains elevated compared to pre-COVID levels, PPE revenue was about 7% less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $226.2 million, compared to $181.9 million last year. The fire business organic growth rate was 18.3% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 53.5%, both businesses finished the year strong. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $946.2 million, compared to $859.1 million last year, an increase of 10.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.6% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 46.8% last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 45.7% for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, 46.1% for First Aid and Safety Services, 47.5% for Fire Safety Services, and 39.3% for Uniform Direct Sale.  Operating income of $404.4 million, compared to $356.4 million last year, an increase of 13.5%. Operating income margin was 19.5%, compared to 19.4% reported last year, a 10 basis point increase. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.8%, compared to 19.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the fourth quarter was $294.5 million, compared to $267.7 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.81, compared to $2.47 last year, an increase of 13.8%. Note that the higher effective tax rate in this year's fourth quarter was a 500 basis point headwind to the EPS growth rate and a $0.12 headwind to EPS. For our fiscal year 2023, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $8.47 billion to $8.58 billion, an increase of 7.8% to 9.2% over fiscal 2022. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $11.90 to $12.30. Please note the following: Fiscal 2022 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and a gain on an equity investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items fiscal 2022 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7%, and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal 2023 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.68 billion to $1.73 billion, compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains. Fiscal 2023 interest expense is expected to be approximately $110 million, compared to $88.8 million in fiscal 2022 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. The expected higher effective tax rate will negatively impact fiscal 2023 diluted EPS by approximately $0.32 per share and diluted EPS growth by approximately 290 basis points.  Our financial guidance includes share buybacks through July 13, 2022, but does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. And we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul. Sure, Faiza. Our fourth quarter energy for the total company was 2.5%, that's up 40 basis points from a year ago. In our rental segment, energy was up 50 basis points. So, just a little bit more in that business. Our expectation is, on the whole, fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, we're going to see an increase of call it 20 basis points to 30 basis points. We certainly have seen the energy high in June in the first part of our quarter here, but it's nice to see that the price of the pumps come down just a little bit in the last couple of weeks. And our expectation is that it's not going to stay at this elevated level, but certainly higher than our fiscal 2022 year. Thank you. George, great question. As I mentioned earlier, it's a very challenging environment. We've said all along that we're not immune from inflation, but we really like our plan and our investments. And clearly, pricing is a component of our strategy. It has to be \u2013 input costs are significant because specifically labor and material costs, but we think we're doing a great job with that. Our price adjustments are certainly above historical as they need to be to address the costs that are coming through organization. We've done a really nice job of leveraging SG&A to provide us room to invest in other areas where we've had to add people and certainly labor rates etcetera, but it's working nicely. And part of our focus, a big part of our focus is we are looking at customers from a long-term standpoint and saying, yes, we have to adjust price and it will be above historical. However, we are going to find a way to grow margins and do so in ways other than just pricing. And we're doing that in certainly many key initiatives to help improve and find efficiencies in our business. So, you didn't ask specifically about that, but I think that's what you're getting at. And I'll just provide a little bit more color on that because I think it might be helpful for folks to understand that as we take this long term approach with customers, we'll adjust price, but we're going to go find efficiencies so that we can still improve our business and improve margins. I mentioned in our script and by the way most of this, of our efficiencies are tied to SAP and our digital transformation. SAP is the backbone of how we run our business and how we find \u2013 how we're able to enjoy the digital transformation that we're experiencing and our customers are experiencing as well. So just bear with me. I'll walk through a few of these for some color. I mentioned [in] [ph] My Cintas online portal, which \u2013 it provides us really nice leverage. It provides us improved revenue via sales and retention because customers value the ability to manage their program and pay their bills on their time, not just when our office is available. So that's great, but it also provides us some improved productivity because it allows customers to self-serve instead of our partners having to take care of that as well. I mentioned in the script as well, our Smart Truck technology, which is proprietary routing technology, it allows for more efficient routing and tracking of our vehicles. Where does this help us? It helps us and provides us more time that we can spend with customers instead of driving. That's more productivity. It provides real time tracking to assist with customer needs. It helps us reduce idle times, which is obviously important to us. Lower fuel consumption and obviously lower GHG emissions as a result. And in fact, over the last three quarters within our rental division, our distance between customers has reduced 5%, which is just \u2013 it's just finding an efficiency in our business by leveraging technology and because driving, as we've always said, when the wheels are moving, we don't generate any revenue, it's when we'll stop.  So that's important to us. And then, we also have something that we've rolled out through our technology transformation or digital transformation. What we call our operational excellence dashboards, which allows for us the ability to evaluate our production facilities, our plans to see how they're performing without having to be at each plant physically to evaluate performance. So, in the past, you had to be at a plant to see how they were performing and were they on time and were turn times in our washout. We track everything. And now we have technology that allows us to do that. And so it's all driven because of our SAP platform. Many of this, it ends up showing up in faster turnaround of product, better utilization of in service inventory, which helps offset purchases. It's been significant for us. And I thought I'd just provide a little color because I thought it might help you as you think about pricing and how we're fighting inflation. Thank you. Andy, thanks for the question. It depends upon the when, how long, how deep that recession is and that's for others to try to forecast. But we see \u2013 fortunately, we have plenty of runway on finding efficiencies in our business. When we think about the value that we're providing our customers, you know when our customers are healthy, our business is that much better, but we will fight through whatever recession comes our way. We've done that and we've shown the ability to gross sales and profits in, I'd say, just about every operating environment out there. 51 of the past 53 years, the exception being the 2008, 2009. I certainly hope that it's not that deep, [nasty] [ph] for recession, whatever comes next, but we'll be prepared to manage through that as you've seen us do over the years. Great. Thank you, Andy. And the partners in that area, thank you for asking about it as well. As you know, that can be a little bit more spiky, the direct sale business, but the comps were easier, but nevertheless, we like the momentum we have in that business. We've diversified our customer base. We're selling to a broader area. We've got nice position in that market. And yes, we like where we are. Now, certainly comps will get tougher next year. So, even more so in the back half of the year, not just for that business, but all of our businesses. But we really like the momentum and the position in the marketplace in that business. Thank you. Sure Manav, certainly when you think about the cost structure and I'll speak mostly to our rental business. Certainly, labor is an important bucket for us. And as you've heard Todd explain over the last four quarters or so, we've worked really hard over the last several years to improve the \u2013 or increase the rates at higher than I'll say historical averages and that left us not flat footed in this challenging environment and it's allowed us to continue to raise, but not in an alarming rate that maybe some of our other competitors have had to do. And we'll continue to manage that very, very appropriately. The other bucket that I'll mention is, our material costs. Certainly material cost is a big component. And as you know, we are able to amortize the rental items. So, the items that we are reusing in the business in a recurring nature garments, dust mats, mops, etcetera, shop towels. And so, we're able to amortize those and so we don't get inflation impact immediately. This amortization allows us to understand what's coming and it allows us to anticipate and that allows our global supply chain to flex when we need to, to change volumes around. And that's very important for us to be able to see ahead, and the other thing it allows us to do, it allows us to potentially get a couple of price increases in, before that, I'll say higher cost even hits our P&L. So for example, when we have \u2013 if we have cost increases in our materials, and we amortize those over 18 months. That first high \u2013 that first months of higher cost, we have [one-eighteenth] [ph] of it. The second month, we get [two-eighteenth] [ph] of it. So, it doesn't fully hit our P&L for eighteen months. We can adapt, make decisions, including pricing decisions before that fully hits us. So, we have this, we've got this nice, I'll call it, hedge in that part of the cost structure and that certainly is an important part of our cost structure. And the other thing I'll say is, certainly we've got some infrastructure and we can leverage that infrastructure pretty well with revenue growth like we've got it today and the momentum. And so, we've been able to manage all of those buckets in different ways, but quite appropriately. And then when you couple of those \u2013 the way we manage those different buckets with the initiatives that Todd spoke of to get efficiencies, labor efficiencies, productivity improvements, technology improvements, those things can really help us as we face inflation and as Todd laid out, we've got a pretty good game plan against it. As you've seen, we've in this year just ended, in a pretty difficult inflationary environment, we were able to raise our operating margins 50 basis points. Sure. Andrew, I'll tackle the first part and turn the First Aid question over to Todd. So, as it relates to our revenue guidance, 7.8% on the low-end, 9.2% on the high-end. In the fourth quarter, we had 30 basis points of organic benefit and FX impact. I would expect that we'll see that continue for let's call it the first half of the year. And depending on then the acquisitions that we make in fiscal 2023, we may see that continue, but any future acquisitions are not baked into those numbers.  So, call it the first half of the year we'll continue with something in the way of 20 basis points to 30 basis points of M&A and FX. And that's probably going to decrease then without any new M&A activity in the back half of the year. Does that answer your question Andrew? Okay. And then Todd, I'll turn it over to you for the first aid. Sure. Yes, Seth. Our free cash flow has been good. Our expectation is that that's not going to change in this upcoming fiscal 2023 year. Our CapEx look, we expect it to be in the 3% to 3.5% of revenue type of a range. If you look over the last 10 years, that's maybe a little bit down from where we've been, but we're going to keep investing in the business. As it relates to our capacity, we have had some really good growth this year. And there are spots where we've had to add capacity, but generally speaking, I don't expect that we'll have significant and I'll say lumped together type of capacity investments that will happen over time as we continue to grow. So, our expectation is our good and healthy free cash flow will continue in fiscal 2023. Sure, Heather. I'll say a couple of things. We've got first of all great momentum in the business and we love the value that we're providing our customers and the outsourcing that is needed in this challenging time is really resonating and working well for us. So that's really important for us in any turn in the economy we like our momentum. That's important. I would say, if you think about the last 10 years, our growth has been in multiples above GDP and why is that? And multiples above employment growth. And why is that? It's because we're able to sell number one to many what we call in the industry no programmers. So those that don't have a current recurring program. And that's important because in any kind of environment, we go to prospects and existing customers and when we sell the value, usually it's for things that they're already spending money on. And so we're not necessarily asking them to spend new money, we're asking them to spend money with us while we take work content away from them. So, for example, we don't want you to do things, we don't want our customers to do it all themselves. That takes time, capacity, labor, etcetera. We want to help them do it. And so as we take that work content away from them, again in any type of environment that's helpful, but certainly in one where businesses are feeling the pressure of an economy that can really resonate and help. So, we like the way that our value is working. And in the past, we've really been able to grow when there hasn't been much economic growth or employment growth. And our expectation is, we'll continue to be able to do that. 60% of our new business comes from those no programmers. The other thing is, look, we've got a different kind of sales force today than we did at 10, 12 years ago and that sales force is really dialed in on finding those no programmers, finding the business and also penetrating more and our penetration has worked very well. But that sales team is also focused on different verticals that we were walking by in the last recession. And those verticals like healthcare can be a little bit less impacted by recessions and that's good for us. So, we like the diversity in our customer base that we've created over the course of the last 10 years. We think moving forward that diversity is going to help us as we move forward. In addition to that, look, we're going to continue to look for M&A opportunities and we're going to look for \u2013 continue to look for efficiency opportunities and those will help protect us in the next downturn. We can't predict when it may happen. If it's happening, we can't predict how long, how deep, how broad it's going to be. but we like where we are today with momentum and a value proposition that is resonating better than ever. And as you've seen Heather over the course of the last few years, if we need to pivot, we've shown that we can pivot and pivot appropriately to match the environment. Sure. Certainly, the rental business is more affected by energy than the other businesses, no question about it. We had really nice quarters in our First Aid business as you point out. And what you're seeing there is that cabinet growth that we talked about earlier in the call being 25% plus and that getting back to mix that we love. And so, we've \u2013 our First Aid team has really done a nice job of getting that \u2013 working on that mix and getting it back to the, I'll say, pre-pandemic type of mix closer to that kind of mix. So, really good mix shift and momentum in that business. Our fire and Uniform Direct Sale businesses margins are certainly benefiting from the great top line improvement. We're getting great leverage. They're not \u2013 that all other is not affected by the energy in the same way that rental is. And we're able to see some superb productivity out of that group too. So, we really like that momentum. On the rental side, we like where the business is and we've been investing in that business for the growth that we've seen in terms of an acceleration throughout the year. And look, operating a business isn't always a linear \u2013 perfect linear function. And that means there are times when there's a little bit more investment in some quarters, not as much in others. And look, overall, we love the trajectory of the rental business. We have certainly added some of those growth routes that I mentioned earlier, some capacity in the production facilities, but we like where the momentum is going in all of those businesses, but it's not a perfectly linear type of a thing to operate a business. Sure. I'll do my best. Yes, the guide that we provided provides for operating income growth of 8.6% at the low, 12% at the high, when we're comparing to that adjusted [2022] [ph] operating income. What can take us to the low \u2013 I don't, I don't \u2013 we don't mean to be overconfident, but I would say that the things that concern us most are certainly the macro and what happens that's outside of our control. Right now, we really like the way the prospects and the customers view our value. Our sales productivity numbers are really high. And I think it's more about the macro for us. And certainly, we're not trying to time or predict a recession and our numbers don't necessarily incorporate a recession, but there's a little bit of economic movement that certainly can happen that may move us towards the low end of that range. If we don't see any economic slowdown, we certainly, given the revenue momentum, we certainly could exceed the high-end. So, I would say, more than anything, it's about the macro and how does that impact us. From an interest perspective, look, the Fed is not finished and we do have some, albeit a fairly small amount, but we do have some variable interest, variable debt and the Fed is not finished. So, we may see a little bit of an impact as we go through the year, but on the other hand, we generate a lot of cash. I talked about our free cash flow a little bit earlier and if we feel like we have available cash, we'll certainly pay down some variable debt. So, I would say the 110 that we gave in the guide is a reasonable number and I wouldn't expect that to move too much unless we did something with the use of our cash potentially in M&A, otherwise, I think that 110 is a fairly solid type of a number. From a tax rate perspective, look, it's hard to predict what's going to happen in the stock market. It's hard to predict based on the stock market movement how much we may see in the way of exercises of our stock options, etcetera, those things can have an impact on our tax rate. And so it's hard to predict where we're going to be, but that 20% that we're in the guide, I think that's a reasonable place for us and what would take to move that down, it would take a more significant amount of stock options being exercised than we're expecting or it certainly could be other discrete events that happen that we're not expecting, but I think the 20% is a fairly good guide again based on what we're seeing today."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul F. Adler: Thank you, Sergei. And thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2022 third quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd M. Schneider: Thank you Paul. Our third quarter financial results are led by a strong revenue increase of 10.3%. The benefits of our strong top line growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding the onetime gain recorded in this year\u2019s third quarter of selling and administrative expenses, operating income margin increased 90 basis points from 18.4% to 19.3% and EPS grew 13.5% from $2.37 to $2.69. Our financial results are indicative of our compelling value proposition. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, cleanliness, safety, and compliance. And challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs businesses increasingly turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday.  I'm especially pleased with our financial results because they were achieved in a period in which U.S. inflation hit a 40 year high. Inflation is high and broad and one need not look any further than the corner gas station to see it. We've been able to navigate this challenging time and delivered increased operating margins and EPS by productively starting new business, penetrating existing customers with more products and services, providing excellent service while driving operational efficiencies, and obtaining incremental price increases from our customer base. As we grow via new business we achieve operating leverage, better negotiating leverage with suppliers, denser routes, and more volume on our plants. As we penetrate existing customers we realize even stronger incremental operating margins. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other.  Turning now to our business units, the uniform rental and facility services operating segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $1.55 billion compared to $1.42 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.9%. Our news vertical strategies of healthcare, education, and state and local government continue to post leading revenue growth rates. However, there are opportunities for us in all verticals. Businesses in all sectors are struggling to fill open positions. There are about 11 million job openings in the U.S. alone. Businesses remain concerned with their ability to properly sanitized even as COVID infections decreased. Additionally, businesses are shedding non-core competencies to reduce costs and minimize the impacts of inflation. For these reasons and others, businesses are increasingly outsourcing to Cintas.  Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter was $213.0 million compared to $198.5 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 6.2% which is a nice improvement from last quarter's 3.2%. This improvement reflects the growing momentum of our First Aid cabinet business which grew 22% in the third quarter. We welcome this mixed shift because it is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins.  Third quarter revenue growth improved despite a difficult comparison. And last year's third quarter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of personal protective equipment or PPE were very high and the business grew organic revenue of 17.7%. At that time PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix. The amount of PPE has declined year-over-year as expected, however, COVID infections are still prevalent. In fact, we sold about $15 million in a new product which is COVID test kits in this year\u2019s third quarter. PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID.  Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $194.3 million compared to $160.7 million last year. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was 15.3% and Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 48.7%. Both businesses have bounced back as expected.  I'd like to comment on another one of our strengths namely cash flow. Third quarter operating cash flow increased 18.5% from last year. In this year's third quarter $105 million was used for acquisitions. On March 15th, we paid shareholders $99 million in quarterly dividends. And during the quarter and through March 22, 2022 Cintas purchased $584.2 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder return. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to do so consistently.  Finally, I want to share some great news on our technology front. Our ERP provider SAP extended membership in their Strategic Customer Program to Cintas. This is an exclusive program. Only 1% of SAP's customers have membership in it. Inclusion in the program enables us to engage directly with top management of SAP and gain access to its developers and new technologies to realize valuable outcomes for our customers, suppliers, and employees. This program will speed the pace of our transformation into a more data dynamic and process efficient business. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nJ. Michael Hansen: Thanks, Todd. Our fiscal 2022 third quarter revenue was $1.96 billion compared to $1.78 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 10%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $898.2 million, compared to $809.5 million last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 45.6% last year, an increase of 20 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a headwind, increasing 45 basis points from last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 46.3% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 44.2% for First Aid and Safety Services, 46.6% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $407.6 million compared to $326.5 million last year. Operating income margin was 20.8% compared to 18.4% reported last year. Fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income included a $30.2 million gain on the acquisition of an entity -- of an equity method investment. The gain was recorded in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment's selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this gain, fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income, as a percentage of revenue, was 19.3%, an increase of 90 basis points from last year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.2% compared to 14.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. This year's third quarter equity method investment transaction included a significant tax benefit. Excluding the transaction, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 19.6%. Net income for the third quarter was $315.4 million, compared to $258.4 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.97 compared to $2.37 last year. Fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS contained $0.28 from the gain on the equity method investment transaction, which included a related $0.07 tax rate benefit. Excluding this gain and the related tax impact, fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS was $2.69 compared to $2.37 and in last year's third quarter, a 13.5% increase. We're increasing our financial guidance. We expect our fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.96 billion to $2.02 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.54 to $2.74. Our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.2% compared to a rate of 19.4% for last year's fourth quarter. The expected higher effective tax rate is anticipated to negatively impact fiscal 2022 fourth quarter diluted EPS guidance by approximately $0.14 and diluted EPS growth by approximately 560 basis points. Our financial guidance includes share buybacks through March 22nd, but does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. Finally, I wanted to provide an update on our debt and liquidity. We have $650 million of senior notes maturing April 1st, 2022, and $300 million of senior notes maturing June 1st, 2022. We expect to refinance these amounts with funds received via the issuance of new senior debt. Also, we closed today on a new credit facility, increasing it to $2 billion and extending it to 2027. We have a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. I'll turn it over to Paul, now.\nPaul F. Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. \nAlexander Hess: Hi, this is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman today. I wanted to touch briefly on what you guys are seeing at the vertical level, maybe with respect to a rebound and a potential rebound in hospitality or is that -- was that still being dragged in your last quarter from Omicron and then maybe, also, progress maybe, in driving adoption in healthcare, any comments on those two fronts? Thanks guys.\nTodd M. Schneider: Sure, Alex. Thanks for the question. Our vertical strategy is working quite well. You mentioned the hospitality sector, it is certainly bouncing back. If you -- what you read in the news, bookings are up in the airlines and the hospitality sector. So yes, so that's bouncing back. And I think the results in our direct sales business, which is in large part tied to -- certainly, to a percentage tied to the hospitality area, the results are outstanding. So -- but in our other verticals, we're having very good success in each of those. And in the healthcare, specifically, we see a -- we're very much in the early innings but we have products and services that are compelling to that customer base. And we're continuing to evolve and create new products and new technologies that we're integrating there. So as a result, we're very bullish on our strategy in that area, with our focus in that area, and I think the results are reflective.\nAlexander Hess: Thank you. \nOperator: Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning. You had referenced penetrating more customers as part of strong incrementals, specifically as it relates to that, do you have a sense of how many customers today are buying more than one service from you, has that changed at all due to having SAP? What was that same number pre-pandemic just so we can get a sense of that initiative?\nTodd M. Schneider: Yes. Hamzah, certainly being virtually on one system now, it is certainly helping our transparency into cross-selling. What I'll tell you is, again, we're in the early innings of cross-sell. There is a -- our ability to add product, we have a really long runway in that area. Just to get to even a reasonable level of penetration, where we feel excited about it, there is a long, long runway to penetrating our customers with our existing products separate from what we're going to bring into the marketplace in the future, which is we're always working on new products and services. So we feel good about that. So it's certainly improving, but very much in the early innings of that -- on that subject.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question, I'll turn it over, it is just, around M&A, any updated thoughts as to the pipeline there or have valuations come in at all, I know you've talked about historically, that M&A doesn't necessarily mean it has to be route-based, just walk us through that as well, the rationale there? Thank you. \nTodd M. Schneider: Sure, Hamzah. We -- as we noted, M&A was good in the third quarter of our -- the investment we've made in acquiring businesses. We're highly acquisitive. The pipeline looks attractive. It takes different reasons for different companies to transact. You can't always predict that timing, but we are very much a willing buyer and of all shapes and sizes. We're very, very acquisitive and interested in making deals. So we're ready, willing, and able to continue to move forward in that area.\nJ. Michael Hansen: Yes. Hamzah, we -- as you heard Todd mention, our third quarter included an overall acquisition number of $105 million, which is certainly a step up from where we've been. Now, included in that is the purchase of the remaining shares of the equity method investment, which was about $48 million within that number. But the rest of the M&A of $57 million is still a step-up from where we've been. So there has been some good movement this entire fiscal year, and we like the messaging that we're getting. We like the pipeline and as you can see so far this year, we've acted on many of those.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it, very helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: George Tong, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks, good morning. Can you discuss how the business is being impacted by rising input costs, including wage inflation and higher energy costs? And how effectively pricing trends are offsetting this?\nTodd M. Schneider: Good morning George. Thanks for the question. Certainly, expected that inflation and input costs would be something that we would want to be talking about. So we have -- so I have a few examples I'd like to talk about regarding items that we are -- steps that we're taking to mitigate input costs. But inflation is -- yes, it's certainly challenging. It's very much there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, whether it's fuel or other areas, input costs are real. But we're being very active in taking steps to make sure that we are mitigating that type of exposure. You mentioned pricing, so certainly pricing is a component of our strategy, but it is -- by no means is it the only strategy to combat pricing -- or excuse me, to combat inflation. So we're taking other steps and they almost all involve technology. And these were all initiatives that we have been working on. However, due to the inflation subject, we decided to pull them forward and go faster with them. And individually, they are not massive movers, but collectively they certainly add up. So I'll go through a few of those that I think might help provide a little color.  First off, I mentioned in, I think, our last call, that we have invested in routing technology that is proprietary and really fits our business well. And as long as I've been with the company, it seems like we have tried about every routing software out there, and we finally said we're going to build it ourselves. We're going to do it. It's going to fit with SAP, and it will be -- because we have a unique routing structure, so we did that. And I'm very thankful that over the past couple of years, we've invested in that technology. We've rolled out across the organization, and we're executing on it. Now, we -- very important, right, we recognize that we only generate revenue when the truck stops. When it stops at our customers' place of business, that's when we can generate revenue. So we've got to be more efficient. And I'm really pleased with that investment. Certainly, it takes time. There's -- we are very conscious of any customer disruption, but we're trying to go faster with that subject. And again, we're blessed that we made the investment. And if we didn't have it, then it would put much more pressure on the organization with the inflation subject. So again, very pleased that we have that. We've also, from a technology standpoint, we invested in some in automation. We now have three different processes for how to implement automation into our uniform processing facilities. And this provides us flexibility we didn't have in the past. That flexibility is, meaning we can deploy one of those based upon a number of factors really gets into the footprint of the facility and the number of pieces going through. But we've pivoted on this subject as well to go faster, because of what's going on with labor costs, certainly. So we're able to automate our facilities in a sped-up fashion. And then I've got a couple of others that I'll talk about. We now -- we've invested in technology through SAP that allows us to have a centralized dashboard and look at all of our rental processing facilities and understand how they're operating on a daily basis, a real-time basis from an efficiency and effectiveness standpoint. So in the past, we had to go physically see these facilities to understand if they're operating in the manner that we expect. But now, we have this real-time dashboard and it allows us to know how we're doing. And as a result, there's more accountability, and we're getting better. That allows us to improve the efficiencies within our business. And I've got a few others, but one other I'll give you is we are -- because of the technology we have with SAP now, we're seeing a real nice impact in our ability to share our used inventory of garments across all of our locations. This is due to our stock rooms, which is where we house our used inventory at each of our locations having real-time inventory tracking and all being on that same system of SAP. So what it allows us to do is to gain better use of the inventory that was in the past, dedicated solely to the individual locations customer base. Now, we can spread it out across a much larger customer base. And we -- and it also allows us with, nonstock sizes, to look at where the product is and get it faster to our customers. So I could go on, but hopefully, that gives you a few examples of items that -- proactive steps that we are taking to mitigate the inflation. Because, again, as I mentioned, it's real, it's challenging, but I'm highly confident that the organization will be able to manage through this as we have in the past.\nGeorge Tong: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, could you provide a brief update on how your customer base is being affected by supply chain disruptions and the flow-through impact on demand for Cintas' services?\nTodd M. Schneider: Yes. Certainly, George, our customers aren't being impacted by supply chain that's slowing them a bit. But -- and we care passionately about how our customers are, their business are doing, because it obviously has a dynamic impact on us. But as I mentioned earlier, the challenges that our customers are facing was staffing and labor costs. They're looking for ways to outsource and we're beneficiaries of that. We are certainly excited about supply chain issues abating and our customers being able to go even faster, but to date, that's a bit of a headwind, but we have the tailwind of the outsourcing and the benefits we're seeing there.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful, thank you. \nOperator: Ashish Sabadra, RBC. Please go ahead. \nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question and thanks for providing that detailed color on the technology front. I was wondering if you could also talk about how technology is helping you more on the dynamic pricing and more like local pricing, can you just quote on further just on the pricing trend what the normalized pricing has been historically, and how are we thinking about pricing here, particularly in the inflationary environment and the response to your -- by your customer to maybe, potentially, higher price? Thanks.\nTodd M. Schneider: Thanks, Ashish for the question. I'll start, if Mike wants to contribute as well. We -- certainly, we -- again, being on one technology platform gives us the ability to use large amounts of data to analyze. And -- but pricing is -- it's a local subject. It's a customer-by-customer subject, industry by industry. But it does give us -- the technology, does give us the ability to look more strategically at our customer base to make sure we're making really good long-term decisions. So we feel good about that. We've had that in place, and we've taken that approach over the past couple of years, and we'll continue that approach and make sure that we're not just making sweeping decisions, but they're more targeted decisions that are more strategic.\nJ. Michael Hansen: Maybe, I'll simply add, certainly, with all of the inflation in the news, the customers are -- it's a little bit of an easier conversation today than it might be otherwise. And so our customers have generally been receptive to that, and that results in a little bit of a higher pricing impact than in the past. And so we've talked a lot about 0% to 2% in the past, and we're a little bit above that today. And so that certainly is one way for us to fight inflation.\nTodd M. Schneider: Great, Mike. Thank you. But just to point out, clearly, the majority of our growth is coming from more volume growth not pricing, and it is due to the value that we're adding to customers and new business that we're selling, ads and penetrating our customer base, that's where the majority of our growth is coming from, clearly.\nJ. Michael Hansen: I just want to conclude the thought with going back to Ashish to the technology. I think sometimes, it's hard for people to understand the magnitude of the transactions in this business. One of our General Managers of our operations, just one operation, I mean, they can have 5,000 customers. And so the ability to have the technology, as Todd spoke to, and seize upon that to be able to supplement the GM's ability to analyze 5,000 customers to ensure that the pricing is where it needs to be or to see trends in the data to understand if there are customers that are kind of comparing back, reducing services over time, that's a jeopardy account. I, the General manager need to get in front of that particular customer, those are the types of advantages that the technology provides, because it is just such a luminous business and that technology and the additional eyes and that intelligence is certainly a huge competitive advantage.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe, if I can just ask, I'm not sure if you have quantified how big energy is as a percentage of overall expenses but also, my question is more longer-term. How are you thinking about improving the energy efficiency of the business, both on the truck side, but also on the laundry facilities front? Thank you. \nJ. Michael Hansen: Sure, Ashish. The third quarter total energy for the business was 2.3% of sales. In our guidance side certainly, the gas price has escalated as we got into February, and we're thinking more in terms of 2.6% to 2.8% in our fourth quarter. So certainly, we're going to see a little bit of our expectation is we'll see a little bit of an increase. Just to give you a little bit of maybe, an impact of what we have already done to be more energy efficient, if you go back to the last time we saw prices at the pump at this kind of level was back in calendar 2014. And if you think about the third quarter of our calendar 2014, we were certainly a smaller company, but our total energy at that time was 3% of revenue. So at the same price in the pump, we've been able to reduce our energy by almost a third and from 3% to 2.3%. So we've made some really good progress and we've talked about some of those things. Some of it is certainly scale and growth, but as Todd has talked about, some of it is also the routing efficiency, the penetration that allows us to park the truck a little bit longer.  So we've made some really nice progress over the last several number of years. And how do we think about it going forward, we certainly are going to continue to work at routing efficiency, penetration, but also, certainly, we've talked a little bit about getting electric vehicles on to the road and that has started. And our expectation is we'll put many, many more of those as we move towards our goal of net zero in 2050. So there's a lot more to come in this type of space and we're in the early, early part of exploring that alternative fuel vehicles, but we certainly think that's a big part of our future.\nTodd M. Schneider: Ashish, in addition, I mentioned earlier about the centralized dashboard that allows us to understand how our locations are functioning, at what level of efficiency. That speaks directly to energy usage in our production facilities. So the more efficient we are, the lower the consumption of the energy, certainly, per pound, specifically. And then, I didn't mention, but we have also, over the past couple of years, we've invested in converting all of our locations to LED lighting, which helps in our ESG journey, but it helps with the consumption of energy and helps reduce some cost. So it's also a cost mitigation subject. So -- and we're looking at other items in that area to reduce energy consumption in our production facility.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color and congrats on the solid results.\nOperator: Andy Wittmann, R.W. Baird. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Wittmann: Hey thanks. Let's just keep going on this path, I guess. Mike, just when kind of using your EPS and your revenue guidance, I'm backing into fourth quarter margin guidance, which is at the midpoint about flat year-over-year. I think that's probably right, and you can comment on that, I suppose. But you just mentioned that energy prices on a sequential basis, maybe, like 40 basis points. I was wondering if the third quarter was plus 90 basis points adjusted on the margin improvements, you got 40 in energy, what's the other 50? And can you talk about some of the other puts and takes that drive you to that margin -- implied margin guidance?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Yes. I would -- let's start with the implied margin guidance. The range that we see is something like 18.5% at the bottom to 20% at the top. So last year's fourth quarter was 19.4%. So you're right, at the midpoint, it's somewhat flattish against, let's call it, a 60 to 80-point energy headwind from a year ago. And at the top of that range, it's margin expansion even in this period of time. So our goal will be to continue to drive towards margin expansion even in a pretty difficult environment. So getting back to, I think, your question of why, maybe, not more margin expansion. First of all, I would say, look, Andy, I don't know how many companies are expanding margins in this kind of environment, but we intend to. But we also are growing quite nicely. And you've seen our growth move from organically, 8.6% in total in the first quarter to 9.3% to 10%. And growth means for us, when we're growing that volumes, we are investing in things like capacity in our wash alleys and other places. We're investing in -- even when we talk about the route efficiency that doesn't mean we're necessarily not adding routes. And so we're going to continue to invest in our routes. We're going to continue to invest in other customer-facing positions. And so we're going to continue to invest even in this kind of environment, because the growth is very, very good and strong. So that comes with a little bit of a cost too. But gosh, Andy, in this kind of environment, we're looking at a 60 to 80-point -- basis point energy headwind to guide towards margin expansion, we feel pretty good about.\nAndrew Wittmann: Yes, I wasn't trying to imply otherwise. Could you comment specifically on the labor market, are your positions filled today, are you having enough people to do what you need them to do, and can you talk about the overall pricing trends on that category, specifically?\nTodd M. Schneider: Andy, we always have job postings, openings, we're growing. And as I mentioned earlier, we're growing our volume very attractively. So there's more work and we're really pleased about that. So -- and the labor market is challenging, trying to get the levels that we're at. We're running at higher RPMs to get there, not speaking of when I say higher RPMs, our management team is working harder to get there. But we like our staffing levels and we will continue to plan to invest in that area. We like our productivity that we're seeing from our partners in all areas of our business. And I think that speaks in large part to our culture, where our folks are -- they get up earlier, they work harder, they work later. And as a result, we have a strategic competitive advantage in the marketplace as a result of that. But yes, we're conscious of -- we're trying to add roles, and we're doing it quite successfully. It's never good enough, as you know, from a leadership standpoint, that we're focused on.\nAndrew Wittmann: Thanks.\nOperator: Tim Mulrooney, William Blair. Please go ahead. \nTimothy Mulrooney: Yeah, good morning. I wanted to go back to pricing for a second. If your uniform contracts are typically several years in length, can you talk about the actual mechanics around how you adjust for pricing, are there annual pricing conversations stipulated within the contract or do you just kind of reach out to customers as needed when you hit certain inflationary thresholds? And are there inflation pass-through provisions in these contracts? Thank you. \nTodd M. Schneider: Tim, thanks for the question. We have a million customers or more. So the answer is you name it, we've got it. But generally, what I'll speak to is our agreements allow us to raise price and raise price as appropriate. And when we do so, our approach is we do that once a year. It doesn't mean that they all happen on the same day. They may be spread out throughout the year, but the conversation is once a year with the customer. And we have found that, that is -- our commitment to our customers is to handle it in that manner. They like that. Our partners like that. And in these inflationary times, as Mike mentioned earlier, those conversations are going better than they normally have. And they are, just because inflation is front and center of everything, every newspaper that I look at. But our approach is once a year with the customer, and we've been sticking by that, and we plan to continue to stick by that commitment to them.\nTimothy Mulrooney: Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you. \nOperator: Manav Patnaik, Barclays. Please go ahead. \nManav Patnaik: Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the labor environment broadly, it sounds like you're managing your own labor pretty well. But just curious what you can share in terms of the challenges, struggles, openings, turnover, etcetera that your customers are facing and how that's looking today?\nTodd M. Schneider: Manav, certainly we are seeing a higher level, we call it a churn, through our customer base. Meaning, we see people that -- one customer and they end up at the other customer and that is at a higher level than it has been in the past. But nevertheless, we like the trend that we're seeing with our customer base and the ad stops trends that we're seeing. That's positive. And just as I mentioned, it seems like it's harder for businesses right now. Everybody is having to work a little bit more at it and productivity has to be a little bit better, but we are certainly seeing more churn of our -- within our customer base than we did, historically.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And Mike, maybe, just for the fourth quarter, there's some tough comps on the rental side and then the fire side as well, I believe. If you could just help us with maybe the sequential organic growth trends we should be thinking about, what the M&A contribution is maybe?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Sure. When we think about organic growth for the rental division, we were at 8.9%. Our expectation -- and so first of all, Manav, let me maybe step back. The guidance for us implies 6.8% to 10% growth, slightly over 10% growth. So we love the momentum of the rental business, and we think that's going to continue to perform very, very well in those upper single-digit type ranges. First Aid and Safety is going to rebound quite a bit in the fourth quarter due to great momentum, but also, a little bit of an easier comp. And we expect that to be in the mid-teens. Our fire business, which grew organically 15.3% this quarter, we continue to expect a very good growth in that area. And then, our Uniform Direct Sale business is going to face a tougher comp. And likely, that's going to come back to something more normalized low to mid-single digits. Did I get -- I'm not sure if I heard the second part of your question, if there was one, Manav.\nManav Patnaik: Yes, it was just around given all the M&A. I guess, you picked up on what that quality contribution would look like.\nJ. Michael Hansen: Got it. Yes, yes. So I think I covered that. Maybe, I'll touch on, we talked about -- I talked about the M&A and a big component of that M&A was this equity investment transaction. That is we have got into a joint venture years ago for primarily, the purposes of product innovation and particularly, within our Facility Services business. But that's a component. That entity, which we decided made sense to wholly own now is going to tuck into our global supply chain. So it's relatively non-revenue producing. And so we won't see much of an impact on that. It tucks in the global supply chain.\nManav Patnaik: Got it, thank you. \nOperator: Heather Balsky, Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nHeather Balsky: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to just touch on and clarify some stuff on the PPE side. Just curious where you guys are relative to 2019 levels at this point, are you still above, or are you -- have you gotten back to kind of a more normalized trend? And then you mentioned sales of COVID tests during the quarter, how you're thinking about that business going forward and is there an inventory investment around that as well? Thank you. \nJ. Michael Hansen: Yes. Our personal protective equipment sales have still been above pre-pandemic levels. We like -- we've talked a little bit throughout here about the value that our customers are seeing in it. And we are certainly recognizing that they still value safety, cleanliness and sanitizing. And so those revenue streams are still above pre-pandemic levels. It's hard to predict what those are going to look like into the future, but they're certainly above pre-pandemic. And the value proposition is being -- is resonating certainly, more today than it did pre-pandemic. So we like the movement in that business and so far, the staying power of that. From a test kit perspective, as we've done throughout this pandemic, our goal has been to do our best to take care of our customers. And in this particular quarter with Omicron really rising, our customers were asking us for the test kit opportunities, and we were able to fulfill those. It did not come with an inventory requirement. Our expectation is that's not going to be big mover into the future. We called out about $15 million worth, that's something that we wouldn't typically expect to repeat at anything close to that level.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. And just a follow-up on the PPE side, just because I recall, it's a lower margin business. Is that -- even though it's still elevated, is it declining, do you see it as a tailwind to your margins going as it sort of levels off going into the next quarter and into next year as well?\nJ. Michael Hansen: The short answer is yes, Heather, and I'll maybe, talk about it this way. The First Aid and Safety business where a lot of that PP&E has been, we've seen some really nice momentum in the First Aid side of the business. And that generally comes with those better margins. And we saw a nice uptick from our second quarter to our third quarter in our First Aid and Safety gross margins. And our expectation is that momentum is going to continue even though we still certainly hope that there is more PPE going forward than pre-pandemic. But you're right, Heather. As the mix tilts back to a greater amount of First Aid business, we expect those gross margins to start to get closer and closer towards those pre-pandemic levels. But the one thing I will say in the First Aid and Safety businesses are, we made a nice jump in our operating margin too. And if you think about the SG&A part of that business, we -- our salespeople are producing at very, very high levels and our SG&A in that business is well below pre-pandemic levels. And so as we continue this mix moving in the right direction, our expectation is that those overall operating margins will certainly get back to pre-pandemic levels and can improve from there. We were at, call it, in the mid-14% range pre-pandemic, and we're on our way back towards those. And our goal, certainly, would be more expansion after that.\nHeather Balsky: Okay, thank you for that color. \nOperator: Scott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. \nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. And guys, I have one more following up on inflation and price. You had stated that the majority of the growth is coming from volume. And I'm just curious, I guess the essence of the question is what percent of the -- you're doing on a customer by customer base, but what percent of your base would you say you have affected with price increases at this juncture and will we see a greater percentage of the growth going forward coming from the pricing side as opposed to the volume side as that kicks in on who you've already priced and who you maybe have yet to a price, just a little bit better feel on the time as how much more contribution we may see from price offsetting cost pressure going forward? Thanks. \nTodd M. Schneider: Thanks for the question, Scott. How we approach it, as I mentioned, it's once a year, but it's a relatively smoothed out throughout the year. And as we've talked about in the past, some of it depends upon the condition of that customer, how their business is, that industry, that geography. And as time goes on, hopefully, that will become a lot more consistent. But no, I think what you're seeing, as far as our volume growth and the pricing wins that we're getting, I think you'll see that be pretty consistent in the future. I don't think you'll see an outsized percentage coming from pricing next year and the coming weeks, months, or something like that, because of how we approach it. And again, we're very, very happy with the level of demand that we're seeing from our customer base. It's very attractive for us. We're investing appropriately for it, and we're very pleased.\nScott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. Appreciate that response. For my follow-up, I'm just curious, going back to this 1% of SAP extended membership in which you're participating. Could you elaborate on how that came to be and you covered some of the benefits about what it offers. But just if you could take us a little bit deeper on, was that something you pursued, was that something that they granted, how it came to be and just where you expect to go with that? Thanks.\nTodd M. Schneider: Great. Great. Yes. We're very proud of the relationship we have with SAP, and it goes back a number of years now. And it is something that they bestowed upon us. Our relationship has been flourishing over the past few years because of the degree to which we deploy their technology and the usefulness that we get out of it. So I think they really like seeing how we leverage their technology. And as a result, it gets us, as I mentioned, it's -- we're in a different stratosphere. And you think about SAP's customer base and then you think about that we're being in the top 1%, it's unique air. And so as I mentioned, it does get us relationships at very high levels. There's an SAP board member that is assigned to us as a customer. We have relationships, again, obviously, at really, really high levels. But it gets us access to their developers and to their technologies on the front end instead of it being rolled out. And then we got to figure out, we can have input and instead of just having something roll out and then we got to figure out how to manage through the change. So when you're in that 1%, you have the ear of those folks and allows you to impact where those items go. So as a result, we think that's an advantage for us. And we're very pleased with it and very pleased with our investment with SAP, and we're seeing real dividends from that as we -- I think we've laid out over the past few quarters.\nScott Schneeberger: That sounds great. Thanks, I will turn it over. \nOperator: Shlomo Rosenbaum, Stifel. Please go ahead. \nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey Todd, where are you now in terms of opening up and getting back to normal, like kind of an apples-to-apples basis in terms of volumes with your customers. So pre-COVID versus where you are today, how much more is -- juice is left in that kind of recovery play for things just kind of opening up more and getting back to your historical basis of, let's say, 2019 volume levels?\nTodd M. Schneider: Shlomo, great question. Our customers are, for the most part, they're all open. Certainly, there are some that are, unfortunately, that did not survive through the pandemic and the challenges that through at folks. But our customers are all -- I'll say they're open. They're not all at the same levels of consumption that they once were. Some are higher, some are lower. But we think there's still similar opportunity there as the economy opens up and to a larger degree, as people are back more to work to a larger degree. So we think that's positive. And we think there's also some hidden benefits that we can get from the fact that during the -- throughout the pandemic, as we've talked about, the customers see us in a different light. How we handled their accounts, how we handled their invoices, the lack of increase in the flexibility that we provided, but also the access to product that they didn't even know that we provided in the past. So Shlomo, that is an advantage for us. The fact that they look at it and they say, \"Wow, we didn't realize Cintas provided these items.\" They can get them. They're great to work with. They're consistent and they're reasonable. So as a result, that, I think, sets a different level of different pool level. But we still think there's even more opportunities within that customer base where folks -- where they will get back to a spend level where they once were. So we think the future looks quite attractive from that standpoint.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you. And then just to clarify, maybe, this is for you, Mike. The equity method investment was the supply chain technology business, early stage that you brought in and then you decided that you wanted to own all of it, but it's not the product sale, it's a capability to manage your business internally, is that what we're talking about?\nJ. Michael Hansen: It's a -- it has been an entity where we've done product innovation that has created products for the rental division, particularly in Facility Services. So it's -- while it isn't a direct producer of revenue, it has created products over the years that have created revenue streams for the rental division.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, alright. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nToni Kaplan: Thank you. I wanted to ask one more follow-up on inflation and whether you have inflationary escalators built into the contracts and if you do, what percent of contracts do you have that built in?\nTodd M. Schneider: Toni, I appreciate the question. As I mentioned earlier, we have such a broad customer base that you name it, we have it from a contractual standpoint. Generally speaking, we have the ability to raise price and no limits, and do so as we deem appropriate. We fundamentally and practically, how we've handled it is we go in and we talk to the customer once a year and explain what the adjustment -- the price adjustment is and we managed through that. But no, we're not limited. Certainly, do we have certain customers that we have limits on? Absolutely. But generally speaking, no, we're not limited from that standpoint. It's more about making good long-term practical decisions that help us retain those customers for life. And while we're at it, I'll just -- I will say, our customer retention rates are really attractive right now. They have been since -- for the past couple of years and they have certainly not degraded. So we're excited about that. I think in large part, it's our approach, Toni, that we take on this subject about the flexibility, the pricing, the reasonableness and we have good conversations that I think people understand and we can manage through it.\nToni Kaplan: Great. And there are a couple of -- there's a question about different verticals earlier and you mentioned a couple of them in specific, but I wanted to understand if there were certain verticals outside of, I think it was healthcare and hospitality that we mentioned earlier, that have seen higher or lower growth than normal, just if there's any others that would makes sense to call out? And then related, just wanted to hear any color on the new business pipeline. Thanks.\nTodd M. Schneider: Sure. So hospitality is obviously, as you're reading in the journal and other periodicals, it's -- bookings are way up for those folks there. So that's bounced back nicely. Healthcare has been some stops and starts, but the demand for our products have been very consistent. And through the pandemic, us being -- having product available was a big deal. And the movement towards getting away from, in many cases, as folks looking at and saying, \"hey, we don't want a onetime disposable.\u201d They're hard to access, not great for the environment and going to reusable has been great in health care, which we've kind of detailed out in the past. Education sector, has been, I'd say, a little bit of stops and starts as well in the fact that they literally stopped and started in their schools in many cases. But generally speaking, the education sector is doing quite well. And then lastly, with the government sector, that's obviously been really consistent. And we like our verticals. We like our approach in those areas and they're all growing attractively, and we expect them to continue to grow attractively based upon our strategy there.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nTodd M. Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Alright, it appears there are no further questions in the queue, I would like to hand the call back over to Mr. Paul Adler for any additional or closing remarks. Over to you, sir.\nPaul F. Adler: Alright. Thanks, Sergei, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 financial results in July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd M. Schneider",
            "content": "Thank you Paul. Our third quarter financial results are led by a strong revenue increase of 10.3%. The benefits of our strong top line growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding the onetime gain recorded in this year's third quarter of selling and administrative expenses, operating income margin increased 90 basis points from 18.4% to 19.3% and EPS grew 13.5% from $2.37 to $2.69. Our financial results are indicative of our compelling value proposition. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, cleanliness, safety, and compliance. And challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs businesses increasingly turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday.  I'm especially pleased with our financial results because they were achieved in a period in which U.S. inflation hit a 40 year high. Inflation is high and broad and one need not look any further than the corner gas station to see it. We've been able to navigate this challenging time and delivered increased operating margins and EPS by productively starting new business, penetrating existing customers with more products and services, providing excellent service while driving operational efficiencies, and obtaining incremental price increases from our customer base. As we grow via new business we achieve operating leverage, better negotiating leverage with suppliers, denser routes, and more volume on our plants. As we penetrate existing customers we realize even stronger incremental operating margins. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other.  Turning now to our business units, the uniform rental and facility services operating segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $1.55 billion compared to $1.42 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.9%. Our news vertical strategies of healthcare, education, and state and local government continue to post leading revenue growth rates. However, there are opportunities for us in all verticals. Businesses in all sectors are struggling to fill open positions. There are about 11 million job openings in the U.S. alone. Businesses remain concerned with their ability to properly sanitized even as COVID infections decreased. Additionally, businesses are shedding non-core competencies to reduce costs and minimize the impacts of inflation. For these reasons and others, businesses are increasingly outsourcing to Cintas.  Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter was $213.0 million compared to $198.5 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 6.2% which is a nice improvement from last quarter's 3.2%. This improvement reflects the growing momentum of our First Aid cabinet business which grew 22% in the third quarter. We welcome this mixed shift because it is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins.  Third quarter revenue growth improved despite a difficult comparison. And last year's third quarter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of personal protective equipment or PPE were very high and the business grew organic revenue of 17.7%. At that time PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix. The amount of PPE has declined year-over-year as expected, however, COVID infections are still prevalent. In fact, we sold about $15 million in a new product which is COVID test kits in this year's third quarter. PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID.  Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $194.3 million compared to $160.7 million last year. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was 15.3% and Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 48.7%. Both businesses have bounced back as expected.  I'd like to comment on another one of our strengths namely cash flow. Third quarter operating cash flow increased 18.5% from last year. In this year's third quarter $105 million was used for acquisitions. On March 15th, we paid shareholders $99 million in quarterly dividends. And during the quarter and through March 22, 2022 Cintas purchased $584.2 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder return. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to do so consistently.  Finally, I want to share some great news on our technology front. Our ERP provider SAP extended membership in their Strategic Customer Program to Cintas. This is an exclusive program. Only 1% of SAP's customers have membership in it. Inclusion in the program enables us to engage directly with top management of SAP and gain access to its developers and new technologies to realize valuable outcomes for our customers, suppliers, and employees. This program will speed the pace of our transformation into a more data dynamic and process efficient business. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Sure, Alex. Thanks for the question. Our vertical strategy is working quite well. You mentioned the hospitality sector, it is certainly bouncing back. If you -- what you read in the news, bookings are up in the airlines and the hospitality sector. So yes, so that's bouncing back. And I think the results in our direct sales business, which is in large part tied to -- certainly, to a percentage tied to the hospitality area, the results are outstanding. So -- but in our other verticals, we're having very good success in each of those. And in the healthcare, specifically, we see a -- we're very much in the early innings but we have products and services that are compelling to that customer base. And we're continuing to evolve and create new products and new technologies that we're integrating there. So as a result, we're very bullish on our strategy in that area, with our focus in that area, and I think the results are reflective. Yes. Hamzah, certainly being virtually on one system now, it is certainly helping our transparency into cross-selling. What I'll tell you is, again, we're in the early innings of cross-sell. There is a -- our ability to add product, we have a really long runway in that area. Just to get to even a reasonable level of penetration, where we feel excited about it, there is a long, long runway to penetrating our customers with our existing products separate from what we're going to bring into the marketplace in the future, which is we're always working on new products and services. So we feel good about that. So it's certainly improving, but very much in the early innings of that -- on that subject. Sure, Hamzah. We -- as we noted, M&A was good in the third quarter of our -- the investment we've made in acquiring businesses. We're highly acquisitive. The pipeline looks attractive. It takes different reasons for different companies to transact. You can't always predict that timing, but we are very much a willing buyer and of all shapes and sizes. We're very, very acquisitive and interested in making deals. So we're ready, willing, and able to continue to move forward in that area. Good morning George. Thanks for the question. Certainly, expected that inflation and input costs would be something that we would want to be talking about. So we have -- so I have a few examples I'd like to talk about regarding items that we are -- steps that we're taking to mitigate input costs. But inflation is -- yes, it's certainly challenging. It's very much there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, whether it's fuel or other areas, input costs are real. But we're being very active in taking steps to make sure that we are mitigating that type of exposure. You mentioned pricing, so certainly pricing is a component of our strategy, but it is -- by no means is it the only strategy to combat pricing -- or excuse me, to combat inflation. So we're taking other steps and they almost all involve technology. And these were all initiatives that we have been working on. However, due to the inflation subject, we decided to pull them forward and go faster with them. And individually, they are not massive movers, but collectively they certainly add up. So I'll go through a few of those that I think might help provide a little color.  First off, I mentioned in, I think, our last call, that we have invested in routing technology that is proprietary and really fits our business well. And as long as I've been with the company, it seems like we have tried about every routing software out there, and we finally said we're going to build it ourselves. We're going to do it. It's going to fit with SAP, and it will be -- because we have a unique routing structure, so we did that. And I'm very thankful that over the past couple of years, we've invested in that technology. We've rolled out across the organization, and we're executing on it. Now, we -- very important, right, we recognize that we only generate revenue when the truck stops. When it stops at our customers' place of business, that's when we can generate revenue. So we've got to be more efficient. And I'm really pleased with that investment. Certainly, it takes time. There's -- we are very conscious of any customer disruption, but we're trying to go faster with that subject. And again, we're blessed that we made the investment. And if we didn't have it, then it would put much more pressure on the organization with the inflation subject. So again, very pleased that we have that. We've also, from a technology standpoint, we invested in some in automation. We now have three different processes for how to implement automation into our uniform processing facilities. And this provides us flexibility we didn't have in the past. That flexibility is, meaning we can deploy one of those based upon a number of factors really gets into the footprint of the facility and the number of pieces going through. But we've pivoted on this subject as well to go faster, because of what's going on with labor costs, certainly. So we're able to automate our facilities in a sped-up fashion. And then I've got a couple of others that I'll talk about. We now -- we've invested in technology through SAP that allows us to have a centralized dashboard and look at all of our rental processing facilities and understand how they're operating on a daily basis, a real-time basis from an efficiency and effectiveness standpoint. So in the past, we had to go physically see these facilities to understand if they're operating in the manner that we expect. But now, we have this real-time dashboard and it allows us to know how we're doing. And as a result, there's more accountability, and we're getting better. That allows us to improve the efficiencies within our business. And I've got a few others, but one other I'll give you is we are -- because of the technology we have with SAP now, we're seeing a real nice impact in our ability to share our used inventory of garments across all of our locations. This is due to our stock rooms, which is where we house our used inventory at each of our locations having real-time inventory tracking and all being on that same system of SAP. So what it allows us to do is to gain better use of the inventory that was in the past, dedicated solely to the individual locations customer base. Now, we can spread it out across a much larger customer base. And we -- and it also allows us with, nonstock sizes, to look at where the product is and get it faster to our customers. So I could go on, but hopefully, that gives you a few examples of items that -- proactive steps that we are taking to mitigate the inflation. Because, again, as I mentioned, it's real, it's challenging, but I'm highly confident that the organization will be able to manage through this as we have in the past. Yes. Certainly, George, our customers aren't being impacted by supply chain that's slowing them a bit. But -- and we care passionately about how our customers are, their business are doing, because it obviously has a dynamic impact on us. But as I mentioned earlier, the challenges that our customers are facing was staffing and labor costs. They're looking for ways to outsource and we're beneficiaries of that. We are certainly excited about supply chain issues abating and our customers being able to go even faster, but to date, that's a bit of a headwind, but we have the tailwind of the outsourcing and the benefits we're seeing there. Thanks, Ashish for the question. I'll start, if Mike wants to contribute as well. We -- certainly, we -- again, being on one technology platform gives us the ability to use large amounts of data to analyze. And -- but pricing is -- it's a local subject. It's a customer-by-customer subject, industry by industry. But it does give us -- the technology, does give us the ability to look more strategically at our customer base to make sure we're making really good long-term decisions. So we feel good about that. We've had that in place, and we've taken that approach over the past couple of years, and we'll continue that approach and make sure that we're not just making sweeping decisions, but they're more targeted decisions that are more strategic. Great, Mike. Thank you. But just to point out, clearly, the majority of our growth is coming from more volume growth not pricing, and it is due to the value that we're adding to customers and new business that we're selling, ads and penetrating our customer base, that's where the majority of our growth is coming from, clearly. Ashish, in addition, I mentioned earlier about the centralized dashboard that allows us to understand how our locations are functioning, at what level of efficiency. That speaks directly to energy usage in our production facilities. So the more efficient we are, the lower the consumption of the energy, certainly, per pound, specifically. And then, I didn't mention, but we have also, over the past couple of years, we've invested in converting all of our locations to LED lighting, which helps in our ESG journey, but it helps with the consumption of energy and helps reduce some cost. So it's also a cost mitigation subject. So -- and we're looking at other items in that area to reduce energy consumption in our production facility. Andy, we always have job postings, openings, we're growing. And as I mentioned earlier, we're growing our volume very attractively. So there's more work and we're really pleased about that. So -- and the labor market is challenging, trying to get the levels that we're at. We're running at higher RPMs to get there, not speaking of when I say higher RPMs, our management team is working harder to get there. But we like our staffing levels and we will continue to plan to invest in that area. We like our productivity that we're seeing from our partners in all areas of our business. And I think that speaks in large part to our culture, where our folks are -- they get up earlier, they work harder, they work later. And as a result, we have a strategic competitive advantage in the marketplace as a result of that. But yes, we're conscious of -- we're trying to add roles, and we're doing it quite successfully. It's never good enough, as you know, from a leadership standpoint, that we're focused on. Tim, thanks for the question. We have a million customers or more. So the answer is you name it, we've got it. But generally, what I'll speak to is our agreements allow us to raise price and raise price as appropriate. And when we do so, our approach is we do that once a year. It doesn't mean that they all happen on the same day. They may be spread out throughout the year, but the conversation is once a year with the customer. And we have found that, that is -- our commitment to our customers is to handle it in that manner. They like that. Our partners like that. And in these inflationary times, as Mike mentioned earlier, those conversations are going better than they normally have. And they are, just because inflation is front and center of everything, every newspaper that I look at. But our approach is once a year with the customer, and we've been sticking by that, and we plan to continue to stick by that commitment to them. Manav, certainly we are seeing a higher level, we call it a churn, through our customer base. Meaning, we see people that -- one customer and they end up at the other customer and that is at a higher level than it has been in the past. But nevertheless, we like the trend that we're seeing with our customer base and the ad stops trends that we're seeing. That's positive. And just as I mentioned, it seems like it's harder for businesses right now. Everybody is having to work a little bit more at it and productivity has to be a little bit better, but we are certainly seeing more churn of our -- within our customer base than we did, historically. Thanks for the question, Scott. How we approach it, as I mentioned, it's once a year, but it's a relatively smoothed out throughout the year. And as we've talked about in the past, some of it depends upon the condition of that customer, how their business is, that industry, that geography. And as time goes on, hopefully, that will become a lot more consistent. But no, I think what you're seeing, as far as our volume growth and the pricing wins that we're getting, I think you'll see that be pretty consistent in the future. I don't think you'll see an outsized percentage coming from pricing next year and the coming weeks, months, or something like that, because of how we approach it. And again, we're very, very happy with the level of demand that we're seeing from our customer base. It's very attractive for us. We're investing appropriately for it, and we're very pleased. Great. Great. Yes. We're very proud of the relationship we have with SAP, and it goes back a number of years now. And it is something that they bestowed upon us. Our relationship has been flourishing over the past few years because of the degree to which we deploy their technology and the usefulness that we get out of it. So I think they really like seeing how we leverage their technology. And as a result, it gets us, as I mentioned, it's -- we're in a different stratosphere. And you think about SAP's customer base and then you think about that we're being in the top 1%, it's unique air. And so as I mentioned, it does get us relationships at very high levels. There's an SAP board member that is assigned to us as a customer. We have relationships, again, obviously, at really, really high levels. But it gets us access to their developers and to their technologies on the front end instead of it being rolled out. And then we got to figure out, we can have input and instead of just having something roll out and then we got to figure out how to manage through the change. So when you're in that 1%, you have the ear of those folks and allows you to impact where those items go. So as a result, we think that's an advantage for us. And we're very pleased with it and very pleased with our investment with SAP, and we're seeing real dividends from that as we -- I think we've laid out over the past few quarters. Shlomo, great question. Our customers are, for the most part, they're all open. Certainly, there are some that are, unfortunately, that did not survive through the pandemic and the challenges that through at folks. But our customers are all -- I'll say they're open. They're not all at the same levels of consumption that they once were. Some are higher, some are lower. But we think there's still similar opportunity there as the economy opens up and to a larger degree, as people are back more to work to a larger degree. So we think that's positive. And we think there's also some hidden benefits that we can get from the fact that during the -- throughout the pandemic, as we've talked about, the customers see us in a different light. How we handled their accounts, how we handled their invoices, the lack of increase in the flexibility that we provided, but also the access to product that they didn't even know that we provided in the past. So Shlomo, that is an advantage for us. The fact that they look at it and they say, \"Wow, we didn't realize Cintas provided these items.\" They can get them. They're great to work with. They're consistent and they're reasonable. So as a result, that, I think, sets a different level of different pool level. But we still think there's even more opportunities within that customer base where folks -- where they will get back to a spend level where they once were. So we think the future looks quite attractive from that standpoint. Toni, I appreciate the question. As I mentioned earlier, we have such a broad customer base that you name it, we have it from a contractual standpoint. Generally speaking, we have the ability to raise price and no limits, and do so as we deem appropriate. We fundamentally and practically, how we've handled it is we go in and we talk to the customer once a year and explain what the adjustment -- the price adjustment is and we managed through that. But no, we're not limited. Certainly, do we have certain customers that we have limits on? Absolutely. But generally speaking, no, we're not limited from that standpoint. It's more about making good long-term practical decisions that help us retain those customers for life. And while we're at it, I'll just -- I will say, our customer retention rates are really attractive right now. They have been since -- for the past couple of years and they have certainly not degraded. So we're excited about that. I think in large part, it's our approach, Toni, that we take on this subject about the flexibility, the pricing, the reasonableness and we have good conversations that I think people understand and we can manage through it. Sure. So hospitality is obviously, as you're reading in the journal and other periodicals, it's -- bookings are way up for those folks there. So that's bounced back nicely. Healthcare has been some stops and starts, but the demand for our products have been very consistent. And through the pandemic, us being -- having product available was a big deal. And the movement towards getting away from, in many cases, as folks looking at and saying, \"hey, we don't want a onetime disposable.\u201d They're hard to access, not great for the environment and going to reusable has been great in health care, which we've kind of detailed out in the past. Education sector, has been, I'd say, a little bit of stops and starts as well in the fact that they literally stopped and started in their schools in many cases. But generally speaking, the education sector is doing quite well. And then lastly, with the government sector, that's obviously been really consistent. And we like our verticals. We like our approach in those areas and they're all growing attractively, and we expect them to continue to grow attractively based upon our strategy there. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Todd. Our fiscal 2022 third quarter revenue was $1.96 billion compared to $1.78 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 10%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $898.2 million, compared to $809.5 million last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 45.6% last year, an increase of 20 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a headwind, increasing 45 basis points from last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 46.3% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 44.2% for First Aid and Safety Services, 46.6% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $407.6 million compared to $326.5 million last year. Operating income margin was 20.8% compared to 18.4% reported last year. Fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income included a $30.2 million gain on the acquisition of an entity -- of an equity method investment. The gain was recorded in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment's selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this gain, fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income, as a percentage of revenue, was 19.3%, an increase of 90 basis points from last year's third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.2% compared to 14.4% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. This year's third quarter equity method investment transaction included a significant tax benefit. Excluding the transaction, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 19.6%. Net income for the third quarter was $315.4 million, compared to $258.4 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.97 compared to $2.37 last year. Fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS contained $0.28 from the gain on the equity method investment transaction, which included a related $0.07 tax rate benefit. Excluding this gain and the related tax impact, fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS was $2.69 compared to $2.37 and in last year's third quarter, a 13.5% increase. We're increasing our financial guidance. We expect our fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.96 billion to $2.02 billion and diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.54 to $2.74. Our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.2% compared to a rate of 19.4% for last year's fourth quarter. The expected higher effective tax rate is anticipated to negatively impact fiscal 2022 fourth quarter diluted EPS guidance by approximately $0.14 and diluted EPS growth by approximately 560 basis points. Our financial guidance includes share buybacks through March 22nd, but does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. Finally, I wanted to provide an update on our debt and liquidity. We have $650 million of senior notes maturing April 1st, 2022, and $300 million of senior notes maturing June 1st, 2022. We expect to refinance these amounts with funds received via the issuance of new senior debt. Also, we closed today on a new credit facility, increasing it to $2 billion and extending it to 2027. We have a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. I'll turn it over to Paul, now. Yes. Hamzah, we -- as you heard Todd mention, our third quarter included an overall acquisition number of $105 million, which is certainly a step up from where we've been. Now, included in that is the purchase of the remaining shares of the equity method investment, which was about $48 million within that number. But the rest of the M&A of $57 million is still a step-up from where we've been. So there has been some good movement this entire fiscal year, and we like the messaging that we're getting. We like the pipeline and as you can see so far this year, we've acted on many of those. Maybe, I'll simply add, certainly, with all of the inflation in the news, the customers are -- it's a little bit of an easier conversation today than it might be otherwise. And so our customers have generally been receptive to that, and that results in a little bit of a higher pricing impact than in the past. And so we've talked a lot about 0% to 2% in the past, and we're a little bit above that today. And so that certainly is one way for us to fight inflation. I just want to conclude the thought with going back to Ashish to the technology. I think sometimes, it's hard for people to understand the magnitude of the transactions in this business. One of our General Managers of our operations, just one operation, I mean, they can have 5,000 customers. And so the ability to have the technology, as Todd spoke to, and seize upon that to be able to supplement the GM's ability to analyze 5,000 customers to ensure that the pricing is where it needs to be or to see trends in the data to understand if there are customers that are kind of comparing back, reducing services over time, that's a jeopardy account. I, the General manager need to get in front of that particular customer, those are the types of advantages that the technology provides, because it is just such a luminous business and that technology and the additional eyes and that intelligence is certainly a huge competitive advantage. Sure, Ashish. The third quarter total energy for the business was 2.3% of sales. In our guidance side certainly, the gas price has escalated as we got into February, and we're thinking more in terms of 2.6% to 2.8% in our fourth quarter. So certainly, we're going to see a little bit of our expectation is we'll see a little bit of an increase. Just to give you a little bit of maybe, an impact of what we have already done to be more energy efficient, if you go back to the last time we saw prices at the pump at this kind of level was back in calendar 2014. And if you think about the third quarter of our calendar 2014, we were certainly a smaller company, but our total energy at that time was 3% of revenue. So at the same price in the pump, we've been able to reduce our energy by almost a third and from 3% to 2.3%. So we've made some really good progress and we've talked about some of those things. Some of it is certainly scale and growth, but as Todd has talked about, some of it is also the routing efficiency, the penetration that allows us to park the truck a little bit longer.  So we've made some really nice progress over the last several number of years. And how do we think about it going forward, we certainly are going to continue to work at routing efficiency, penetration, but also, certainly, we've talked a little bit about getting electric vehicles on to the road and that has started. And our expectation is we'll put many, many more of those as we move towards our goal of net zero in 2050. So there's a lot more to come in this type of space and we're in the early, early part of exploring that alternative fuel vehicles, but we certainly think that's a big part of our future. Yes. I would -- let's start with the implied margin guidance. The range that we see is something like 18.5% at the bottom to 20% at the top. So last year's fourth quarter was 19.4%. So you're right, at the midpoint, it's somewhat flattish against, let's call it, a 60 to 80-point energy headwind from a year ago. And at the top of that range, it's margin expansion even in this period of time. So our goal will be to continue to drive towards margin expansion even in a pretty difficult environment. So getting back to, I think, your question of why, maybe, not more margin expansion. First of all, I would say, look, Andy, I don't know how many companies are expanding margins in this kind of environment, but we intend to. But we also are growing quite nicely. And you've seen our growth move from organically, 8.6% in total in the first quarter to 9.3% to 10%. And growth means for us, when we're growing that volumes, we are investing in things like capacity in our wash alleys and other places. We're investing in -- even when we talk about the route efficiency that doesn't mean we're necessarily not adding routes. And so we're going to continue to invest in our routes. We're going to continue to invest in other customer-facing positions. And so we're going to continue to invest even in this kind of environment, because the growth is very, very good and strong. So that comes with a little bit of a cost too. But gosh, Andy, in this kind of environment, we're looking at a 60 to 80-point -- basis point energy headwind to guide towards margin expansion, we feel pretty good about. Sure. When we think about organic growth for the rental division, we were at 8.9%. Our expectation -- and so first of all, Manav, let me maybe step back. The guidance for us implies 6.8% to 10% growth, slightly over 10% growth. So we love the momentum of the rental business, and we think that's going to continue to perform very, very well in those upper single-digit type ranges. First Aid and Safety is going to rebound quite a bit in the fourth quarter due to great momentum, but also, a little bit of an easier comp. And we expect that to be in the mid-teens. Our fire business, which grew organically 15.3% this quarter, we continue to expect a very good growth in that area. And then, our Uniform Direct Sale business is going to face a tougher comp. And likely, that's going to come back to something more normalized low to mid-single digits. Did I get -- I'm not sure if I heard the second part of your question, if there was one, Manav. Got it. Yes, yes. So I think I covered that. Maybe, I'll touch on, we talked about -- I talked about the M&A and a big component of that M&A was this equity investment transaction. That is we have got into a joint venture years ago for primarily, the purposes of product innovation and particularly, within our Facility Services business. But that's a component. That entity, which we decided made sense to wholly own now is going to tuck into our global supply chain. So it's relatively non-revenue producing. And so we won't see much of an impact on that. It tucks in the global supply chain. Yes. Our personal protective equipment sales have still been above pre-pandemic levels. We like -- we've talked a little bit throughout here about the value that our customers are seeing in it. And we are certainly recognizing that they still value safety, cleanliness and sanitizing. And so those revenue streams are still above pre-pandemic levels. It's hard to predict what those are going to look like into the future, but they're certainly above pre-pandemic. And the value proposition is being -- is resonating certainly, more today than it did pre-pandemic. So we like the movement in that business and so far, the staying power of that. From a test kit perspective, as we've done throughout this pandemic, our goal has been to do our best to take care of our customers. And in this particular quarter with Omicron really rising, our customers were asking us for the test kit opportunities, and we were able to fulfill those. It did not come with an inventory requirement. Our expectation is that's not going to be big mover into the future. We called out about $15 million worth, that's something that we wouldn't typically expect to repeat at anything close to that level. The short answer is yes, Heather, and I'll maybe, talk about it this way. The First Aid and Safety business where a lot of that PP&E has been, we've seen some really nice momentum in the First Aid side of the business. And that generally comes with those better margins. And we saw a nice uptick from our second quarter to our third quarter in our First Aid and Safety gross margins. And our expectation is that momentum is going to continue even though we still certainly hope that there is more PPE going forward than pre-pandemic. But you're right, Heather. As the mix tilts back to a greater amount of First Aid business, we expect those gross margins to start to get closer and closer towards those pre-pandemic levels. But the one thing I will say in the First Aid and Safety businesses are, we made a nice jump in our operating margin too. And if you think about the SG&A part of that business, we -- our salespeople are producing at very, very high levels and our SG&A in that business is well below pre-pandemic levels. And so as we continue this mix moving in the right direction, our expectation is that those overall operating margins will certainly get back to pre-pandemic levels and can improve from there. We were at, call it, in the mid-14% range pre-pandemic, and we're on our way back towards those. And our goal, certainly, would be more expansion after that. It's a -- it has been an entity where we've done product innovation that has created products for the rental division, particularly in Facility Services. So it's -- while it isn't a direct producer of revenue, it has created products over the years that have created revenue streams for the rental division."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Cintas Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Adler : Thank you, Vanasan. And thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2022 second quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance.  These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Paul. Our second quarter financial results were led by a strong revenue increase of 9.4%. Our financial results are indicative of our compelling value proposition, vast total addressable markets, and the outstanding execution of our employee partners. I thank our partners for continuing to navigate these challenging times by focusing on our customers. The benefits of our strong top line growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding last year's $18 million pretax gain on the sale of certain operating assets and Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment and the related tax benefits, second quarter operating income margin increased 70 basis points from last year, and EPS grew 16.5%. These results are especially significant given that they were achieved in a period in which U.S. inflation hit a 39-year high. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.54 billion compared to $1.41 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.5%. The labor market is challenging. However, we are benefiting in the current environment. Businesses are struggling with the scarcity of labor, which has left many understaffed. Also, businesses have a heightened awareness of safety and cleanliness and are concerned with their ability to properly sanitize amid persistent COVID infections. Businesses are increasingly outsourcing to Cintas, so they can focus on their core competencies and be Ready for the Workday.  And it is noteworthy that the U.S. still hasn't recovered about 4 million pre-pandemic jobs, and the job openings totaled about 11 million. Return of jobs represents future revenue growth opportunity for Cintas. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter was $202.2 million compared to $194.4 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 3.2%. Second quarter revenue was up against a difficult comparison. In last year's second quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of personal protective equipment, or PPE were very high and the business grew organic revenue 14.5%. At that time, PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix.  The amount of PPE has declined year-over-year as expected. However, COVID infections are still prevalent and PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID. Over the same period of time, the recurring first aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. In fact, it is up 20% from last year. We welcome this shift in mix because First Aid cabinet service business is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins than PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $184.9 million compared to $152.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 16.9%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 47.3%. Both businesses benefited in part from an improved economic environment. Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remained strong. Second quarter operating cash flow increased 27% from last year and free cash flow improved 16%. Recently, on December 15, we paid shareholders $98.5 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase over the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return. Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight that we recently issued our 2021 environmental, social, and governance report. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity, and maintaining accountability.  The report, our second consecutive provides expanded information and data, including our reductions in energy usage, water consumption, and Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Our ESG report further illustrates that our corporate culture based on doing what is right and challenging ourselves to improve is a competitive advantage. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hansen : Thank you, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 second quarter revenue was $1.92 billion compared to $1.76 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 9.3%.  Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '22 was $885.1 million compared to $819.9 million last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46% for the second quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 46.7% last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 46.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 43.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 44.6% for Fire Protection services, and 39.1% for Uniform Direct Sale. Energy-related expenses were a headwind, increasing 40 basis points from last year. Also, we made investments in labor to support our strong current and anticipated revenue growth. Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percentage of revenue to 26.2% in the second quarter compared to 26.6% last year, operating income of $381.2 million compared to $352.9 million last year. Operating income margin was 19.8% compared to 20.1% reported last year. Excluding last year's second quarter $18 million gain on sale of certain assets, which were recorded in selling and administrative expenses, this year's second quarter operating income grew 13.8% and operating income margin increased 70 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 18% compared to 13.3% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. In addition, last year's second quarter tax rate included a 370 basis point benefit from the sale of certain assets. Net income for the second quarter was $294.7 million compared to $284.9 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.76 compared to $2.62 last year. Excluding last year's second quarter gain and the related tax benefits, which impacted diluted EPS by $0.25, this year's second quarter diluted EPS of $2.76 compares to $2.37, an increase of 16.5%. We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.58 billion to $7.6 billion to a range of $7.63 billion to $7.70 billion, and diluted EPS from a range of $10.60 to $10.90 to a range of $10.70 to $10.95. Please note the following regarding our guidance: Fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.72 and diluted EPS growth by about 700 basis points.  Guidance does not include any future share buybacks, and guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by COVID-19. However, guidance does not contemplate significant COVID-19 pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders or cost necessary to comply with government COVID-19 mandates. Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note that in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with various supplies of personal protective equipment, gloves, in particular. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other. Excluding the PPE that we don't expect to repeat, our second half of the year revenue growth guidance is over 9% at the top end of our range.\nPaul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik : Thank you very much. I was just hoping you could just address kind of your -- in the near-term visibility more in terms of reactions from your customers with the spread of Omicron, and if you're seeing any change in behaviors or are people just kind of chugging along here?\nTodd Schneider : Manav, this is Todd. Thanks for your question. Good morning. At this point, our -- we haven't seen a change in our customer base as a result of Omicron. It's a little early to tell, certainly. But nevertheless, it's -- I would say it's business as usual at this point with our customers, and we're looking forward to the back half of the year.\nManav Patnaik : Got it. And then maybe just as a follow-up, just tied to the other pressures out there, which is inflation, it sounds like you guys are handling that well. You referred to investments in the labor force. Can you just address what that is and broadly how you feel about managing these inflationary pressures going forward as well?\nTodd Schneider : Yeah, great question. Inflation is certainly real, but I think we're managing it quite well. We do have a world-class supply chain organization that is a real competitive advantage in these cases. And fortunately, we've been addressing wages over the past couple of years, as we've spoken about in the past calls.  So, we weren't caught flat-footed as it relates to wages. And our -- certainly, our wage increases are still a little above historical, but we're more investing in the infrastructure to be able to service our customers so that based upon our current growth and our anticipated growth, which is -- we're very excited about.\nTodd Schneider : Thank you.\nTodd Schneider : Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. It's Andrew. If I try to back into the second half operating margins in the full year guide, I get to 19.1%, which is up modestly year-over-year. And I just wanted to make sure that you do the math the same way as maybe you'd kind of go through some of those kind of puts and takes on the second half operating margins.\nMike Hansen : Good morning, Andrew. Our -- we would say our implied operating margin guidance for the second half of the year is a little bit higher than what you stated at 19.1%. We think of it closer to the 19.5%. And look, we still expect some very nice operating margin growth for the year, even in the back half of the year and even in an environment which is pretty challenging, as I'm sure you're aware in terms of the inflationary pressures.  But as Todd mentioned, we're managing that inflation. We like the margin improvement, and our expectation is we're going to see better than the 19.1% that you referred to.\nAndrew Steinerman: And the 19.5% is for the total company, and I assume. And I just wanted to maybe make a comment on increases on the customer side, the B2B increases because you were at a hiatus, now you've [indiscernible] kind of in process of increasing prices to customers and kind of how has that gone? Are they understanding of the inflationary environment?\nTodd Schneider : I'll take that one, Mike. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Certainly, on the pricing, one of the things that's important to understand is that we don't simply send out a letter increasing prices to all 1 million customers, all at the same time. We address the issue throughout the year. So you'll continue to see that.  And also, as we said in the past, pricing is -- it's a local subject. Some industries are still struggling, some are doing quite well. Some geographies are still not back to pre-COVID and others are nicely ahead of the curve. Now inflation is -- it seems like it's in every headline and every time you turn on the news. And as a result, I'd say the conversations with our customers are generally going well and our results are a little bit better than historical in that area as well.  But as you know, we take a long-term approach and we focus on the lifetime value of our customers, which, frankly is reflected in our NPS scores being at all-time highs. Now all that being said, in the face of inflation being at a 39-year high, we are growing our operating income and incremental margins at very attractive rates, and we're excited about that.\nAndrew Steinerman: Right. And then just confirm 19.5% was total company, right?\nMike Hansen : Yeah. It was a total company against last year of just under 19%. So again, what we think to be a pretty healthy margin improvement. And let's keep in mind, last year's margins were record margins and 310 basis points higher than pre-pandemic levels, so we like where we're headed with this -- with the margins in the back half of the year.\nAndrew Steinerman: Well said. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Okay. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nMario Cortellacci: Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Just my first question around labor. Maybe you can just update us just not on the labor inflation portion, but also on the labor availability in your business and kind of how you're managing through that?  And then also, maybe you could tie that through to what your pricing strategy looks like regarding that, especially since you guys really haven't taken any price in the past 2 years, I believe it was?\nTodd Schneider : Yes, Mario. This is Todd. As far as labor availability, we're competing quite well out there. We pay a very competitive wage and very attractive benefits. And we think we're an employer of choice. And that's reflecting in our staffing levels, which we like. It's certainly more challenging this year than in the past in general, but we're competing quite well, and we like that. As far as how we look at the pricing? Again, it's a -- you'll see it throughout the year. And it is something that we look at customer by customer. And because, as I mentioned, it's a local subject. And we do look at the long-term value of the customers. But we have -- we're doing better than historical. And the reason being is because it's -- there's a little bit of wind in your sales as far as customers are highly aware of what's going on with inflation in general and wage pressures as well.  But as a result, we think we're in a good spot. I'm very thankful that we have been addressing wage increases over the past few years because it prevented us from being flat footed coming in and being under real pressure.\nMario Cortellacci: Great. And then just for my follow-up. Can you just comment on the Fire business and your strategy for getting into some of the top fire markets that you're not currently in? And do you intend to play in any other adjacencies within the Fire business such as what API Group or other larger players have done in that space?\nTodd Schneider : Yes, Mario. As far as the Fire business, we're continuing to build out our footprint. We have found that we very much liked our model that we are providing the service levels to customers. And it's showing up very nicely in new business wins and retention, and you're seeing it in the growth.  As far as adjacencies, we're always evaluating those, but we think there's incredible run rate in that business with the type of strategy we have today without even going into an adjacency, but we're certainly always evaluating this.\nMario Cortellacci: Great. Thank you very much. And I hope you all have a great holiday.\nTodd Schneider : Thank you. You too.\nOperator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your gross margins contracted 80 bps year-over-year in the Uniform Rental segment. Can you elaborate a bit on margin performance there and what your guidance implies for Uniform segment gross margins?\nTodd Schneider : Certainly, George. This is Todd. I'll start and then Mike can chime in. Gross margin in general, is up 40 basis points due to just energy alone, so that's obviously a headwind. I think gas stand-alone is up 60% year-over-year.  But as far as the balance of that, the 70 basis points, we're making investments in the additional employee partners that we need to service the very nice growth that we're seeing along with the growth that we see coming. The revenue now, George, is different -- a little different from last year. It's much closer to our revenue -- our traditional revenue mix. And let me just give you an example because I think it'll maybe help you understand that a little bit better. With PPE last year there was obviously significant demand for that, and we're happy to help our customers with it. But in those cases, in many of the cases with that, they were simply a drop ship to those customers. And when you drop ship, those large quantities, it doesn't take a whole lot of work. It's just a drop ship and then you're able to book the revenue, et cetera. You think of that versus the level of employee partners that is required to service uniforms, facility services, first aid and safety cabinets, it simply takes more work.  However, we welcome this shift as it provides more value to the customers than simply a drop ship. It's stickier business and long-term, they have better margin. So we like it. We like that switch, and we knew that, that was coming, and we've been staffing for it and guiding for it. All that said, as we know inflation is at a 39-year high. As I mentioned, energy is up 40 basis points. Our investment in growth for today and the future. And if you exclude the onetime gain of our operating -- our onetime gain from last year, our operating margins were up 70 basis points and our incremental margins are quite strong.  So we're doing exactly what we had hoped and planned for, I guess, would be the way I would describe it.\nGeorge Tong : Got it. That's helpful. Your health care and hygiene businesses have seen a boost in demand with COVID. Can you talk about trends and the broader opportunity you're seeing in health care and hygiene?\nTodd Schneider : Certainly. Health care, they're connected, right? But health care is a vertical, hygiene is subject to across all businesses. So as far as the health care vertical, we're continuing to see strong demand. We like what we're providing with scrubs items to help customers clean patient rooms and other rooms in addition to isolation gowns. So all of that is -- we continue to be very bullish about the health care vertical. As far as hygiene, and I'll lump hygiene with sanitization cleanliness, all of that Health and safety. All of that is -- we believe, has been a see change and something that is going to be wind at our sales maybe forever, right, because of you see the focus that people have on sanitizing, hygiene, health, safety. We think we can see that in certainly our Uniform Rental, Facility Services segment, but also our First Aid business. People are very focused on the health safety and wellness of their people and their customers, of their patients and their guests. And as a result, that's good for us.\nGeorge Tong : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. \nTodd Schneider : Thank you. \nOperator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC.\nAshish Sabadra : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the comments that you made on the health care, but just focus on the larger opportunities across the 3 verticals, health care, government and education vertical. I was wondering if you could comment on the pipelines for those larger opportunities. Thanks.\nTodd Schneider : Yeah. Ashish, the pipeline looks quite strong for all those verticals. We feel good. Our sales organization is operating at a very high level and we really like our new business wins in that area. Our retention is very attractive.  So you look at all that, you say our new business wins are very strong. Our retention is very strong. And we are excited for our customers to get back to full strength as well. And we think that bodes well for the future for us.\nAshish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe just talking about technology on the last call, you had talked about the benefits of SAP implementation and more to come. I was wondering if you could talk about what you're doing on the technology front, on the automation front, provide some preview on what we could see over the next few -- next year? And how should that help offset some of the inflationary pressure? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider : Yeah. Great question. So obviously, investing in technology is 1 of our top priorities because we see the opportunity to improve efficiencies in our business, operational efficiencies, but also provide items that the customers notice and recognize and make it easier to do business with us. Those are things that we're trying to leverage.  I think a good example of technology that we're leveraging is by leveraging SAP and partnering with a communications company. We have launched what we call Smart Truck technology, which collects and analyzes data to create a much more efficient routing structure. So what this allows us to do is to spend more time with the customers instead of -- and reduce fuel expense instead of driving in between stops.  And as we say, we only make money in this business when the wheels stop. When the wheels are moving, that's just expense. So we see that as an opportunity to leverage technology to improve operational efficiencies. We have -- as another example, we have launched a portal for our customers that allows them to do business with us online, which is a competitive advantage in the marketplace.  What we're seeing is contrary to years ago, people don't always want to do business during normal business hours. What they're interested in is doing business on their time. And what we're seeing is the request that we see from our customers is well over half of their requests are outside of normal business hours. So it's making it easier to do business with us. We allow them to make requests changes to their program. We allow them to pay their bills online. All these are items that the customers see as an advantage in the marketplace being easier to do business with, and we get really excited when customers see a technology advantage and find us easier to do business with.\nAshish Sabadra : That\u2019s very helpful color. Thank you and happy holidays. \nTodd Schneider : Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Andy Wittmann with Baird.\nAndy Wittmann : Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to get a little subjective comments on the new guidance this quarter versus the guidance you gave last quarter. Mike, it kind of looks like the biggest change in the EPS side is just a little bit lower tax rate. On the revenue side, the quarter beat consensus, you don't guide quarterly, but it kind of feels like the fundamental outlook for the revenue and core operating margin for business hasn't materially changed. Is that the right way of looking at it? Or did you see a change in the business fundamentals that you're factoring into the guidance, the updated guidance today?\nMike Hansen : Andy, I think that's a fair assessment from the perspective of not a lot of change from what we had been talking about in the last quarter, and that is growth continuing to be pretty strong in the second half of the year. Ex that big PPE number that we've talked about in the third quarter and a little bit in the fourth quarter, our growth would be in excess of 9%. And roughly the same margins we've been talking about for much of the year and that is we certainly expect margin growth and continue to expect margin growth. If we did hit 19.5% that I talked about earlier, that's roughly a 60 basis point improvement in the back half of the year. That's coming on top of, I'll call it gain adjusted 50 basis point improvement in the first half of the year. And you might remember, we talked at the early part of the year at a kind of a 0 to 70 basis point improvement. And the performance through midway through the year is showing that we're right at the top of that initial guide. And so the movement is a little bit of taxes, maybe a little bit of margin improvement. But generally speaking, your assessment is fair, Andy. Pretty nice growth and a healthy margin improvement on record margins from a year ago.\nAndy Wittmann : Yeah. Okay. Thanks for go into that, Mike. I guess my follow-up question then just you talked -- you just talked now and previously in the call, you talked about these margins, and I think they speak for themselves. But -- and you talked about price being a little bit above average. Are there any other things that are driving margin performance besides just price and then the operating leverage from the business?  Are there actions or other investments that you're making that are helping this margin performance? Or is this kind of just the natural progression of price/cost as well as fixed cost leverage?\nTodd Schneider : Yeah. Andy, this is Todd. Good question. I think it's the normal operation of the business. We're always investing in various items that help our operational efficiencies. And I mentioned the Smart Truck technology that we think is going to be exciting for us.  But I think it's just the general leverage that we're getting in the face of what is still a very challenging operating environment. And we're, as Mike said, coming off of a record 310 basis point improvement in margin. We're very excited about that, and we're going to continue to take another step forward this year.\nMike Hansen : Andy, I might throw it into a couple of different buckets as well and a little bit of reiterating what Todd and I have already talked about that. Look, our growth is at pretty good levels. And when we grow at those pretty good levels, we get some really nice leverage in the business. And we're seeing that leverage as a benefit, productivity improvements. I mean we've -- from our laundry facilities, to our service and route -- the route improvements that Todd has talked about, to sales rep productivity, productivity is strong and continues to improve as we look at process improvement and innovation and automation. And so productivity is very strong. Efficiencies. Look, we made some pretty difficult cost cuts last year, some changes to our cost structure. And we'd rather not give up many of those. And so while we -- while we'll start to see -- we have started to see a little bit of travel, for example, come in, look, we're still managing the cost structure very tightly.  And maybe then the last bucket I'll throw out there is we've talked quite a bit about resuming pricing and pricing is helping a little bit this year. And so margin improvement, I think we can throw it in those 4 buckets. And it's -- I would say it certainly is leading to some pretty good performance even in the face of 40 basis point increases in energy and other certain inflationary factors.\nAndy Wittmann : Yeah. Great. Thanks for the comprehensive answer guys. Happy holidays. \nMike Hansen : You too, Andy. \nOperator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.\nUnidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] filling in for Tim. Thanks for taking questions here. I wanted to hit on margins real quick again. In the Uniform Rental segment, operating margin was down year-over-year, but still very strong relative to historical standards. Is that kind of how we should think about this segment's margin structure from a long-term perspective, maybe down year-over-year because of higher cost inflation, but capable of maintaining '21 margins in a more normalized environment?\nMike Hansen : Well, a couple of points that I might make. First of all, we talked a little bit about the gain on the sale of assets from a year ago. And so if you take that, that was all recorded in SG&A within rental. If you take out the impact of that gain, last year's second quarter was 21.1% compared to our 22% this year. So a 90 basis point improvement. So some pretty healthy year-over-year improvement. Look, we've been in the rental business above 20% for the last 6 quarters. And our expectation is we're going to see a little bit -- because this is such a challenging environment, we're going to see some ups and downs periodically, but generally speaking, look, we like where the business is running in that rental segment. And our expectation is we'll stay above that 20% number.\nUnidentified Analyst : Excellent. Maybe switching gears back to the PPE. Earlier in the year, I think you expected a PPE headwind of about 1% in fiscal 2022. It sounds like maybe that expectation could be changing a bit. Can you just update us on what you think the PPE headwind will be for fiscal 2022 here?\nMike Hansen : Well, I think if you take a look at our guidance, for example, for the back half of the year. I believe the -- at the high end, the revenue growth is 7.4% over last year. So if you think about the comment we made of growth being 9% we're talking about 160 basis points in the back half of the year.  So you can think about 80 basis points for the full year. So I would say we're not far from where we talked about early on in the year, but certainly, it's back-end loaded a little bit more.\nUnidentified Analyst : Got you. Thanks for the color. Thanks. \nOperator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan : Thank you. Wanted to ask an ESG-related question. Given the size of your fleet, a shift to electric vehicles seems like it would be pretty meaningful. And so I know in your ESG report, you indicated that by January, you expect to deploy 12 electric vehicles. And so just curious if this programs been initiated? And if you could talk about how we should think about the potential of rolling out this to the entire fleet?\nTodd Schneider : Yeah. Toni, this is Todd. Thank you for the question. So yes, we're excited about electrifying the fleet. We are right on schedule as far as what we plan for testing. We have a diverse fleet because of the various types of trucks we have, the rental trucks, the first aid trucks and the fire trucks as well.  But we're working with some very large manufacturers at very high levels, and we're excited about the future as it relates to that. We think that, that is something that's important to our customers, and it's important to our partners and our employee partners, and we think it will be very important to shareholders as well.  So we believe that getting out ahead of this curve is important to us, and we're committed to doing so and dealing with all the challenges that are associated with that -- with the weight of the vehicles that we operate, the size of our fleet and also getting access to the supply, which is why we're working with a diverse group and at high levels. So that way, we're in a good position as an organization.\nToni Kaplan : That's helpful. And one question I've been getting recently is around the ability for you to do large-scale M&A. And some skepticism around that. Do you think that's valid or because of the fragmented market, there's still potential for you to be able to do a large deal? And I'd also say it maybe seems a little harder for deals to get done right now or at least longer to get approved. So just wanted to hear your thoughts around large-scale M&A.\nTodd Schneider : Yes, Toni. So just as a reminder, M&A is our second priority of capital use right behind investing in our business. And we're excited about M&A of all shapes and sizes. We're blessed to have a market that is massive in size, meaning, if you think about how many people are wearing -- garments were in uniforms out in the marketplace, it is a significant market. And that's representative of our new business wins that we have. So about two thirds of our -- the new accounts that we bring in are all people that -- are customers that are what we call no programs. Some people in different industry call the unvended. Nevertheless, when we walk in, they don't have a uniform program and when they walk out, we do. It's a little bit more complicated than that, but that net-net. That being said, that's simply the uniform market.  Our other markets are just a vast addressable market, whether it's facility services and all the headwind -- or excuse me, all the tailwinds that are behind that business from health, safety, sanitation, hygiene. Same way with the First Aid business. And in the Fire business, we see it is obviously a massive market just simply because everybody is required by law to have those products and services.  So yeah, I think we're an incredibly good position in all those because of the market size. That leads us to -- we think we're interested in M&A in all of our businesses and are excited about the potential of M&A of small, medium and large because we think the market is such that it is absolutely appropriate.\nToni Kaplan : Very helpful. Happy holidays. Thank you. \nTodd Schneider : Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger : Thanks very much. Good morning. I'm curious -- this is a question of your average customer in First Aid. Pre-pandemic, what would their cabinet look like? How much has it changed of the items or the contents inside to what it looks like now to the level of detail you can speak to that?  And then how has the pricing and margin profile change of that cabinet? I assume better, but anything you can share on that? And then I'll have a quick follow-up. Thanks. \nTodd Schneider : Okay, Scott. This is Todd. As far as our cabinet, we're constantly bringing out new products for our First Aid cabinet and that is an important component of that business. We offer other services in that business, whether it be AEDs, training and compliance as well as eyewash stations, which are required by OSHA to be serviced appropriately. So all of that is -- we're seeing a return back to a focus on that with our customers, which is exciting to us.  As far as the cabinet itself, besides the new products that we have launched, it's pretty well a traditional type of situation. Now what is changing is the focus on health and safety of employees, customers, guest, patients, those types of things. And as a result, we think that's good for the First Aid business.  And as we've spoken about, the First Aid cabinet business is more predictable, provides more value to the customer than a drop ship type of PPE and is more profitable. So I think as you see that trend of the health and safety continuing and as more people are back to work, then that's going to be very positive for that business.\nMike Hansen : I might add a couple of things. Just reminding you, Scott, that I think Todd mentioned that First Aid cabinet business is up 20% year-over-year in our second quarter. So we really do like the momentum of it. But we're not quite back to the mix of pre-pandemic, but we certainly like the movement towards that mix. And when we think about the gross margin in this business, the material cost really has improved. What you're seeing in this particular quarter is that we're spending a little bit of that improvement on some of the labor investments that Todd talked about in terms of building the service capacity, both for the current growth that we've had, but also for anticipated second half of the year growth.  So really nice performance by our First Aid and Safety partners and the performance is improving just like we expected it to and just like we wanted to.\nScott Schneeberger : Great. Thanks. I appreciate all that color. And the follow-up is on the same subject. You guys are running below what were pre-pandemic peak First Aid and Safety margins. Do you think within a matter of a year or 2, you can get back to the higher level? And why or why not? Thank you.\nTodd Schneider : Yes, Scott, this is Todd. So we're very focused on that. We think that revenue mix will be very positive for us. And we also look at the -- as I mentioned, the win behind our sales and the focus on health and wellness of folks out in the marketplace is going to be positive.  So as we continue to focus on that area, net revenue mix rebalances, then I think you're going to see a nice trend towards more traditional tech margins in that business.\nScott Schneeberger : Great. Appreciate guys. Happy holidays.\nTodd Schneider : Thank you, Scott. You too.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Todd, I wanted to ask you a little bit on the competitive environment. Aramark has been trying to execute a turnaround for the last couple of years. I want to know if does that make a difference to you guys in the market at all. Have you seen a change in terms of competitiveness or in terms that you guys have to be more competitive? Or is the market so fragmented that a change like that wouldn't necessarily filter back to you guys?\nTodd Schneider : Shlomo, thanks for the question. It's a good question. The operating environment we're in, it's always competitive. Nothing noteworthy though, I would say, in the change. Our revenue retention rates are very strong. And as I mentioned, our new business wins are very strong as well. And they're coming from those new programmers much more so than the competition. And I just think it speaks to the vast market out there that we're focused on providing that value to the customers.  When we walk in, and I'll just give uniforms an example. When we walk in 1 of the top areas -- type of things we hear back from customers is, wow, I didn't know you could do all that for what you do it for. So they're surprised. One of the other items that we hear is we didn't know that you would be able to service a customer of our size. They might have 10 wearers. And that is something that like an average-sized customer for us, but the perception is, you have to have 100 people, 1,000 people. So we're attacking that market because we see that the customer sees value in what we provide. And there are also -- there's a little certainly wind behind our sales on it's tough to attract talent right now.  So being able to provide a service like this is something that's attractive to people. And you think about how many people are working out in the marketplace and the fact that we can provide that service to tens of millions of more wearers. It's very exciting for the future. And so as a result of how we focus on it, it really -- those competitive pressures, we're more focused on retaining our customers, and we're more focused on growing the market and because it's just so massive.\nShlomo Rosenbaum : Okay. Great. And then maybe this is one for Mike. Just kind of in the other segments, I know there's definitely volatility quarter-over-quarter in terms of the margins just comparing the operating margin this quarter versus the last couple of quarters. And is there something besides -- sequentially, obviously, it's a lower revenue, which make a difference in the margin going back a couple of quarters. Could you just give us some of the puts and takes of what's impacting the operating margin?\nMike Hansen : Shlomo, when you look at Q2 compared to Q1 keep in mind that we referred in the first quarter call to a gain on sale of some assets. So in that -- in the first quarter, there was a $12.1 million gain. So we had a little bit of an anomaly in that particular quarter.  I'd say this. The Fire business has been performing very, very nicely. And we've seen organic growth this quarter of 16.9% and remains healthy. And some of the things that Todd and I have talked about with the first Aid businesses going on in the Fire business in that we are certainly seeing some great growth. And we're investing for both current -- for that current growth but also for anticipated growth. So we're seeing a little bit of the investment there. And then as you know, Shlomo, the Uniform Direct Sale business can be quite bumpy. And so there's going to be more volatility from quarter-to-quarter in this business. But I'd say this as well, 11.7% for the All Other segment is still a pretty good quarter on a 65-day workday quarter relative to pre-pandemic. So again, just like the other businesses, we like the momentum in these businesses and we like the performance.\nShlomo Rosenbaum : You see that extra day versus, say, 4Q '21 is a bigger impact? And just trying to get a little bit more detail completely appreciate the volatility in the Uniform Direct business?\nMike Hansen : The direct -- I would say that the day is more of an impact to the Fire business than it is the Uniform Direct sale. The Uniform Direct sale tends to be bumpy based on -- could be a rollout of a new program. It's just timing of the sales within those current customer programs. That's the biggest volatility item within the Uniform Direct sale. \nShlomo Rosenbaum : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: All right. It appears there are no more questions at this time. Mr. Adler, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nPaul Adler: Okay. Well, thank you for joining us this morning, everyone. We will issue our third quarter fiscal '22 financial results in March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 second quarter revenue was $1.92 billion compared to $1.76 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 9.3%.  Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '22 was $885.1 million compared to $819.9 million last year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46% for the second quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 46.7% last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 46.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 43.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 44.6% for Fire Protection services, and 39.1% for Uniform Direct Sale. Energy-related expenses were a headwind, increasing 40 basis points from last year. Also, we made investments in labor to support our strong current and anticipated revenue growth. Selling and administrative expenses improved as a percentage of revenue to 26.2% in the second quarter compared to 26.6% last year, operating income of $381.2 million compared to $352.9 million last year. Operating income margin was 19.8% compared to 20.1% reported last year. Excluding last year's second quarter $18 million gain on sale of certain assets, which were recorded in selling and administrative expenses, this year's second quarter operating income grew 13.8% and operating income margin increased 70 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 18% compared to 13.3% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. In addition, last year's second quarter tax rate included a 370 basis point benefit from the sale of certain assets. Net income for the second quarter was $294.7 million compared to $284.9 million last year. Diluted EPS was $2.76 compared to $2.62 last year. Excluding last year's second quarter gain and the related tax benefits, which impacted diluted EPS by $0.25, this year's second quarter diluted EPS of $2.76 compares to $2.37, an increase of 16.5%. We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.58 billion to $7.6 billion to a range of $7.63 billion to $7.70 billion, and diluted EPS from a range of $10.60 to $10.90 to a range of $10.70 to $10.95. Please note the following regarding our guidance: Fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.72 and diluted EPS growth by about 700 basis points.  Guidance does not include any future share buybacks, and guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by COVID-19. However, guidance does not contemplate significant COVID-19 pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders or cost necessary to comply with government COVID-19 mandates. Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note that in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with various supplies of personal protective equipment, gloves, in particular. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other. Excluding the PPE that we don't expect to repeat, our second half of the year revenue growth guidance is over 9% at the top end of our range. Good morning, Andrew. Our -- we would say our implied operating margin guidance for the second half of the year is a little bit higher than what you stated at 19.1%. We think of it closer to the 19.5%. And look, we still expect some very nice operating margin growth for the year, even in the back half of the year and even in an environment which is pretty challenging, as I'm sure you're aware in terms of the inflationary pressures.  But as Todd mentioned, we're managing that inflation. We like the margin improvement, and our expectation is we're going to see better than the 19.1% that you referred to. Yeah. It was a total company against last year of just under 19%. So again, what we think to be a pretty healthy margin improvement. And let's keep in mind, last year's margins were record margins and 310 basis points higher than pre-pandemic levels, so we like where we're headed with this -- with the margins in the back half of the year. Andy, I think that's a fair assessment from the perspective of not a lot of change from what we had been talking about in the last quarter, and that is growth continuing to be pretty strong in the second half of the year. Ex that big PPE number that we've talked about in the third quarter and a little bit in the fourth quarter, our growth would be in excess of 9%. And roughly the same margins we've been talking about for much of the year and that is we certainly expect margin growth and continue to expect margin growth. If we did hit 19.5% that I talked about earlier, that's roughly a 60 basis point improvement in the back half of the year. That's coming on top of, I'll call it gain adjusted 50 basis point improvement in the first half of the year. And you might remember, we talked at the early part of the year at a kind of a 0 to 70 basis point improvement. And the performance through midway through the year is showing that we're right at the top of that initial guide. And so the movement is a little bit of taxes, maybe a little bit of margin improvement. But generally speaking, your assessment is fair, Andy. Pretty nice growth and a healthy margin improvement on record margins from a year ago. Andy, I might throw it into a couple of different buckets as well and a little bit of reiterating what Todd and I have already talked about that. Look, our growth is at pretty good levels. And when we grow at those pretty good levels, we get some really nice leverage in the business. And we're seeing that leverage as a benefit, productivity improvements. I mean we've -- from our laundry facilities, to our service and route -- the route improvements that Todd has talked about, to sales rep productivity, productivity is strong and continues to improve as we look at process improvement and innovation and automation. And so productivity is very strong. Efficiencies. Look, we made some pretty difficult cost cuts last year, some changes to our cost structure. And we'd rather not give up many of those. And so while we -- while we'll start to see -- we have started to see a little bit of travel, for example, come in, look, we're still managing the cost structure very tightly.  And maybe then the last bucket I'll throw out there is we've talked quite a bit about resuming pricing and pricing is helping a little bit this year. And so margin improvement, I think we can throw it in those 4 buckets. And it's -- I would say it certainly is leading to some pretty good performance even in the face of 40 basis point increases in energy and other certain inflationary factors. You too, Andy. Well, a couple of points that I might make. First of all, we talked a little bit about the gain on the sale of assets from a year ago. And so if you take that, that was all recorded in SG&A within rental. If you take out the impact of that gain, last year's second quarter was 21.1% compared to our 22% this year. So a 90 basis point improvement. So some pretty healthy year-over-year improvement. Look, we've been in the rental business above 20% for the last 6 quarters. And our expectation is we're going to see a little bit -- because this is such a challenging environment, we're going to see some ups and downs periodically, but generally speaking, look, we like where the business is running in that rental segment. And our expectation is we'll stay above that 20% number. Well, I think if you take a look at our guidance, for example, for the back half of the year. I believe the -- at the high end, the revenue growth is 7.4% over last year. So if you think about the comment we made of growth being 9% we're talking about 160 basis points in the back half of the year.  So you can think about 80 basis points for the full year. So I would say we're not far from where we talked about early on in the year, but certainly, it's back-end loaded a little bit more. I might add a couple of things. Just reminding you, Scott, that I think Todd mentioned that First Aid cabinet business is up 20% year-over-year in our second quarter. So we really do like the momentum of it. But we're not quite back to the mix of pre-pandemic, but we certainly like the movement towards that mix. And when we think about the gross margin in this business, the material cost really has improved. What you're seeing in this particular quarter is that we're spending a little bit of that improvement on some of the labor investments that Todd talked about in terms of building the service capacity, both for the current growth that we've had, but also for anticipated second half of the year growth.  So really nice performance by our First Aid and Safety partners and the performance is improving just like we expected it to and just like we wanted to. Shlomo, when you look at Q2 compared to Q1 keep in mind that we referred in the first quarter call to a gain on sale of some assets. So in that -- in the first quarter, there was a $12.1 million gain. So we had a little bit of an anomaly in that particular quarter.  I'd say this. The Fire business has been performing very, very nicely. And we've seen organic growth this quarter of 16.9% and remains healthy. And some of the things that Todd and I have talked about with the first Aid businesses going on in the Fire business in that we are certainly seeing some great growth. And we're investing for both current -- for that current growth but also for anticipated growth. So we're seeing a little bit of the investment there. And then as you know, Shlomo, the Uniform Direct Sale business can be quite bumpy. And so there's going to be more volatility from quarter-to-quarter in this business. But I'd say this as well, 11.7% for the All Other segment is still a pretty good quarter on a 65-day workday quarter relative to pre-pandemic. So again, just like the other businesses, we like the momentum in these businesses and we like the performance. The direct -- I would say that the day is more of an impact to the Fire business than it is the Uniform Direct sale. The Uniform Direct sale tends to be bumpy based on -- could be a rollout of a new program. It's just timing of the sales within those current customer programs. That's the biggest volatility item within the Uniform Direct sale."

            "name": "Todd Schneider",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Our second quarter financial results were led by a strong revenue increase of 9.4%. Our financial results are indicative of our compelling value proposition, vast total addressable markets, and the outstanding execution of our employee partners. I thank our partners for continuing to navigate these challenging times by focusing on our customers. The benefits of our strong top line growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding last year's $18 million pretax gain on the sale of certain operating assets and Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment and the related tax benefits, second quarter operating income margin increased 70 basis points from last year, and EPS grew 16.5%. These results are especially significant given that they were achieved in a period in which U.S. inflation hit a 39-year high. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.54 billion compared to $1.41 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.5%. The labor market is challenging. However, we are benefiting in the current environment. Businesses are struggling with the scarcity of labor, which has left many understaffed. Also, businesses have a heightened awareness of safety and cleanliness and are concerned with their ability to properly sanitize amid persistent COVID infections. Businesses are increasingly outsourcing to Cintas, so they can focus on their core competencies and be Ready for the Workday.  And it is noteworthy that the U.S. still hasn't recovered about 4 million pre-pandemic jobs, and the job openings totaled about 11 million. Return of jobs represents future revenue growth opportunity for Cintas. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter was $202.2 million compared to $194.4 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 3.2%. Second quarter revenue was up against a difficult comparison. In last year's second quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sales of personal protective equipment, or PPE were very high and the business grew organic revenue 14.5%. At that time, PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix.  The amount of PPE has declined year-over-year as expected. However, COVID infections are still prevalent and PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID. Over the same period of time, the recurring first aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. In fact, it is up 20% from last year. We welcome this shift in mix because First Aid cabinet service business is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins than PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $184.9 million compared to $152.1 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 16.9%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 47.3%. Both businesses benefited in part from an improved economic environment. Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remained strong. Second quarter operating cash flow increased 27% from last year and free cash flow improved 16%. Recently, on December 15, we paid shareholders $98.5 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase over the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return. Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight that we recently issued our 2021 environmental, social, and governance report. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity, and maintaining accountability.  The report, our second consecutive provides expanded information and data, including our reductions in energy usage, water consumption, and Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Our ESG report further illustrates that our corporate culture based on doing what is right and challenging ourselves to improve is a competitive advantage. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Manav, this is Todd. Thanks for your question. Good morning. At this point, our -- we haven't seen a change in our customer base as a result of Omicron. It's a little early to tell, certainly. But nevertheless, it's -- I would say it's business as usual at this point with our customers, and we're looking forward to the back half of the year. Yeah, great question. Inflation is certainly real, but I think we're managing it quite well. We do have a world-class supply chain organization that is a real competitive advantage in these cases. And fortunately, we've been addressing wages over the past couple of years, as we've spoken about in the past calls.  So, we weren't caught flat-footed as it relates to wages. And our -- certainly, our wage increases are still a little above historical, but we're more investing in the infrastructure to be able to service our customers so that based upon our current growth and our anticipated growth, which is -- we're very excited about. Thank you. Thank you. I'll take that one, Mike. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Certainly, on the pricing, one of the things that's important to understand is that we don't simply send out a letter increasing prices to all 1 million customers, all at the same time. We address the issue throughout the year. So you'll continue to see that.  And also, as we said in the past, pricing is -- it's a local subject. Some industries are still struggling, some are doing quite well. Some geographies are still not back to pre-COVID and others are nicely ahead of the curve. Now inflation is -- it seems like it's in every headline and every time you turn on the news. And as a result, I'd say the conversations with our customers are generally going well and our results are a little bit better than historical in that area as well.  But as you know, we take a long-term approach and we focus on the lifetime value of our customers, which, frankly is reflected in our NPS scores being at all-time highs. Now all that being said, in the face of inflation being at a 39-year high, we are growing our operating income and incremental margins at very attractive rates, and we're excited about that. Yes, Mario. This is Todd. As far as labor availability, we're competing quite well out there. We pay a very competitive wage and very attractive benefits. And we think we're an employer of choice. And that's reflecting in our staffing levels, which we like. It's certainly more challenging this year than in the past in general, but we're competing quite well, and we like that. As far as how we look at the pricing? Again, it's a -- you'll see it throughout the year. And it is something that we look at customer by customer. And because, as I mentioned, it's a local subject. And we do look at the long-term value of the customers. But we have -- we're doing better than historical. And the reason being is because it's -- there's a little bit of wind in your sales as far as customers are highly aware of what's going on with inflation in general and wage pressures as well.  But as a result, we think we're in a good spot. I'm very thankful that we have been addressing wage increases over the past few years because it prevented us from being flat footed coming in and being under real pressure. Yes, Mario. As far as the Fire business, we're continuing to build out our footprint. We have found that we very much liked our model that we are providing the service levels to customers. And it's showing up very nicely in new business wins and retention, and you're seeing it in the growth.  As far as adjacencies, we're always evaluating those, but we think there's incredible run rate in that business with the type of strategy we have today without even going into an adjacency, but we're certainly always evaluating this. Thank you. You too. Certainly, George. This is Todd. I'll start and then Mike can chime in. Gross margin in general, is up 40 basis points due to just energy alone, so that's obviously a headwind. I think gas stand-alone is up 60% year-over-year.  But as far as the balance of that, the 70 basis points, we're making investments in the additional employee partners that we need to service the very nice growth that we're seeing along with the growth that we see coming. The revenue now, George, is different -- a little different from last year. It's much closer to our revenue -- our traditional revenue mix. And let me just give you an example because I think it'll maybe help you understand that a little bit better. With PPE last year there was obviously significant demand for that, and we're happy to help our customers with it. But in those cases, in many of the cases with that, they were simply a drop ship to those customers. And when you drop ship, those large quantities, it doesn't take a whole lot of work. It's just a drop ship and then you're able to book the revenue, et cetera. You think of that versus the level of employee partners that is required to service uniforms, facility services, first aid and safety cabinets, it simply takes more work.  However, we welcome this shift as it provides more value to the customers than simply a drop ship. It's stickier business and long-term, they have better margin. So we like it. We like that switch, and we knew that, that was coming, and we've been staffing for it and guiding for it. All that said, as we know inflation is at a 39-year high. As I mentioned, energy is up 40 basis points. Our investment in growth for today and the future. And if you exclude the onetime gain of our operating -- our onetime gain from last year, our operating margins were up 70 basis points and our incremental margins are quite strong.  So we're doing exactly what we had hoped and planned for, I guess, would be the way I would describe it. Certainly. Health care, they're connected, right? But health care is a vertical, hygiene is subject to across all businesses. So as far as the health care vertical, we're continuing to see strong demand. We like what we're providing with scrubs items to help customers clean patient rooms and other rooms in addition to isolation gowns. So all of that is -- we continue to be very bullish about the health care vertical. As far as hygiene, and I'll lump hygiene with sanitization cleanliness, all of that Health and safety. All of that is -- we believe, has been a see change and something that is going to be wind at our sales maybe forever, right, because of you see the focus that people have on sanitizing, hygiene, health, safety. We think we can see that in certainly our Uniform Rental, Facility Services segment, but also our First Aid business. People are very focused on the health safety and wellness of their people and their customers, of their patients and their guests. And as a result, that's good for us. Thank you. Yeah. Ashish, the pipeline looks quite strong for all those verticals. We feel good. Our sales organization is operating at a very high level and we really like our new business wins in that area. Our retention is very attractive.  So you look at all that, you say our new business wins are very strong. Our retention is very strong. And we are excited for our customers to get back to full strength as well. And we think that bodes well for the future for us. Yeah. Great question. So obviously, investing in technology is 1 of our top priorities because we see the opportunity to improve efficiencies in our business, operational efficiencies, but also provide items that the customers notice and recognize and make it easier to do business with us. Those are things that we're trying to leverage.  I think a good example of technology that we're leveraging is by leveraging SAP and partnering with a communications company. We have launched what we call Smart Truck technology, which collects and analyzes data to create a much more efficient routing structure. So what this allows us to do is to spend more time with the customers instead of -- and reduce fuel expense instead of driving in between stops.  And as we say, we only make money in this business when the wheels stop. When the wheels are moving, that's just expense. So we see that as an opportunity to leverage technology to improve operational efficiencies. We have -- as another example, we have launched a portal for our customers that allows them to do business with us online, which is a competitive advantage in the marketplace.  What we're seeing is contrary to years ago, people don't always want to do business during normal business hours. What they're interested in is doing business on their time. And what we're seeing is the request that we see from our customers is well over half of their requests are outside of normal business hours. So it's making it easier to do business with us. We allow them to make requests changes to their program. We allow them to pay their bills online. All these are items that the customers see as an advantage in the marketplace being easier to do business with, and we get really excited when customers see a technology advantage and find us easier to do business with. Thank you. Yeah. Andy, this is Todd. Good question. I think it's the normal operation of the business. We're always investing in various items that help our operational efficiencies. And I mentioned the Smart Truck technology that we think is going to be exciting for us.  But I think it's just the general leverage that we're getting in the face of what is still a very challenging operating environment. And we're, as Mike said, coming off of a record 310 basis point improvement in margin. We're very excited about that, and we're going to continue to take another step forward this year. Yeah. Toni, this is Todd. Thank you for the question. So yes, we're excited about electrifying the fleet. We are right on schedule as far as what we plan for testing. We have a diverse fleet because of the various types of trucks we have, the rental trucks, the first aid trucks and the fire trucks as well.  But we're working with some very large manufacturers at very high levels, and we're excited about the future as it relates to that. We think that, that is something that's important to our customers, and it's important to our partners and our employee partners, and we think it will be very important to shareholders as well.  So we believe that getting out ahead of this curve is important to us, and we're committed to doing so and dealing with all the challenges that are associated with that -- with the weight of the vehicles that we operate, the size of our fleet and also getting access to the supply, which is why we're working with a diverse group and at high levels. So that way, we're in a good position as an organization. Yes, Toni. So just as a reminder, M&A is our second priority of capital use right behind investing in our business. And we're excited about M&A of all shapes and sizes. We're blessed to have a market that is massive in size, meaning, if you think about how many people are wearing -- garments were in uniforms out in the marketplace, it is a significant market. And that's representative of our new business wins that we have. So about two thirds of our -- the new accounts that we bring in are all people that -- are customers that are what we call no programs. Some people in different industry call the unvended. Nevertheless, when we walk in, they don't have a uniform program and when they walk out, we do. It's a little bit more complicated than that, but that net-net. That being said, that's simply the uniform market.  Our other markets are just a vast addressable market, whether it's facility services and all the headwind -- or excuse me, all the tailwinds that are behind that business from health, safety, sanitation, hygiene. Same way with the First Aid business. And in the Fire business, we see it is obviously a massive market just simply because everybody is required by law to have those products and services.  So yeah, I think we're an incredibly good position in all those because of the market size. That leads us to -- we think we're interested in M&A in all of our businesses and are excited about the potential of M&A of small, medium and large because we think the market is such that it is absolutely appropriate. Thank you. Okay, Scott. This is Todd. As far as our cabinet, we're constantly bringing out new products for our First Aid cabinet and that is an important component of that business. We offer other services in that business, whether it be AEDs, training and compliance as well as eyewash stations, which are required by OSHA to be serviced appropriately. So all of that is -- we're seeing a return back to a focus on that with our customers, which is exciting to us.  As far as the cabinet itself, besides the new products that we have launched, it's pretty well a traditional type of situation. Now what is changing is the focus on health and safety of employees, customers, guest, patients, those types of things. And as a result, we think that's good for the First Aid business.  And as we've spoken about, the First Aid cabinet business is more predictable, provides more value to the customer than a drop ship type of PPE and is more profitable. So I think as you see that trend of the health and safety continuing and as more people are back to work, then that's going to be very positive for that business. Yes, Scott, this is Todd. So we're very focused on that. We think that revenue mix will be very positive for us. And we also look at the -- as I mentioned, the win behind our sales and the focus on health and wellness of folks out in the marketplace is going to be positive.  So as we continue to focus on that area, net revenue mix rebalances, then I think you're going to see a nice trend towards more traditional tech margins in that business. Thank you, Scott. You too. Shlomo, thanks for the question. It's a good question. The operating environment we're in, it's always competitive. Nothing noteworthy though, I would say, in the change. Our revenue retention rates are very strong. And as I mentioned, our new business wins are very strong as well. And they're coming from those new programmers much more so than the competition. And I just think it speaks to the vast market out there that we're focused on providing that value to the customers.  When we walk in, and I'll just give uniforms an example. When we walk in 1 of the top areas -- type of things we hear back from customers is, wow, I didn't know you could do all that for what you do it for. So they're surprised. One of the other items that we hear is we didn't know that you would be able to service a customer of our size. They might have 10 wearers. And that is something that like an average-sized customer for us, but the perception is, you have to have 100 people, 1,000 people. So we're attacking that market because we see that the customer sees value in what we provide. And there are also -- there's a little certainly wind behind our sales on it's tough to attract talent right now.  So being able to provide a service like this is something that's attractive to people. And you think about how many people are working out in the marketplace and the fact that we can provide that service to tens of millions of more wearers. It's very exciting for the future. And so as a result of how we focus on it, it really -- those competitive pressures, we're more focused on retaining our customers, and we're more focused on growing the market and because it's just so massive."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Adler: Thanks, Shelly. Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2022. After our commentary, we'll open the call to questions for analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Paul. We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2022. First quarter total revenue grew 8.6% and diluted earnings per share or EPS grew 11.9%. Every business, whether goods-producing or services-providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness , or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill to help get them Ready for the Workday. Our financial results are indicative of our strong value proposition and vast total addressable market. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.51 billion, compared to $1.39 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.2%. We expected solid growth over the year prior period in which the economy was in a weakened state, but we also made solid progress on a sequential basis. And in total, revenue grew stronger than anticipated. We continued to make measured investments to support our growth. The labor market remains challenging. U.S. still hasn't recovered 5.3 million pre-pandemic jobs. This represents an opportunity for us. Most of our customers are open. However, most are not operating at the same capacity and employment levels as pre-COVID. We are seeing inflationary signs, including higher cost of freight, energy, wages, and supplies. We continue to take actions to minimize the impacts. These include reviewing and challenging our processes and procedures, produce efficiencies, and reduce costs and thoughtfully implementing increases to the pricing of certain products and services in response to higher operational costs. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for first quarter was $199.1 million compared to $204.5 million last year. First quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's first quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment, or PPE, sales were surging propelling the business to grow organic revenue over 17%. At that time, PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix. As discussed on previous earnings calls, the amount of PPE has declined as COVID case counts have fallen from peak levels. However, PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID. Over the same period of time, the recurring First Aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. We welcome this shift in mix because First Aid Cabinet Service business is historically higher profit margin business and more consistent. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All other revenue was $189.7 million compared to $147.7 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 17.8%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business growth rate was 68%. Both businesses benefited in part from increased activity in a period of reduced COVID case counts. Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remains strong. Recently, on September 15, we paid shareholders $98.8 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase of the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return. I'm proud of the execution of our employees, whom we call partners. They continue to navigate an unsettled environment by focusing on our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic continues, of course, fueled recently by the surge of the Delta variant. We remain well positioned headed into the fall and winter months to provide potentially life-saving items such as face masks and gloves, provide hygienically-clean garments such as health care scrubs and isolation gowns and conduct services, including hand sanitizer dispensing and sanitizing spray services. Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight a recent announcement of our ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. We view our ambition to achieve this objective as a natural extension. Also, as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we will soon issue a more robust environmental, social, and governance report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity, and maintaining accountability. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 first quarter revenue was $1.9 billion compared to $1.75 billion in last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.6%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $902.8 million compared to $826.2 million in last year's first quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 30 basis points to 47.6% for the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 47.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.3% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services; 44.8% for First Aid and Safety Services; 46.1% for Fire Protection Services; and 41.5% for Uniform Direct Sale. Selling and administrative expenses of $508.7 million increased 6.7% compared to last year's first quarter. This increase reflects investments in our sales teams as well as slight incremental travel and meeting expenses, somewhat offset by the sale of assets within our Uniform Direct Sale business. Operating income of $394.1 million increased 12.7%. Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 20.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was 11% compared to 7.8% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $331.2 million, an increase of 10.4%. Diluted EPS was $3.11, an increase of 11.9% from last year's first quarter. We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion to a range of $7.58 billion to $7.67 billion; and diluted EPS from a range of $10.35 to $10.75 to a range of $10.60 to $10.90. Please note the following regarding our guidance: Fiscal '22 -- our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.77 and diluted EPS growth by about 760 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. Guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by the surge in COVID-19 Delta variant. However, guidance does not contemplate significant pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders and other restrictions commonly referred to as lockdowns. Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note the following regarding last fiscal year's financial results: In last fiscal year second quarter, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pretax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses and impacted second quarter operating margin by 100 basis points. The pretax gain and the related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. And in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with large supplies of personal protective equipment. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other.\nPaul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.\nTim Mulrooney: Can you talk about the primary factors that led you to raise revenue guidance this quarter? Was it primarily related to the better-than-expected result that you generated here in the first quarter? Or is it more related to your outlook for the remaining three quarters of this fiscal year?\nTodd Schneider: Hey, Tim. It's Todd. Thanks for the question. Well, certainly, our performance in Q1 exceeded our expectations, but we like the momentum that we see in our business. We like the new business, that\u2019s as a driver of growth for us. And we're providing more products and services to our customers. So, to those who are open and hopefully will -- they'll be back to full strength here very shortly. But in general, yes, we like the momentum that we see in our businesses.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay, thanks, Todd. I was wondering if you could also maybe talk about growth by vertical a little bit more this quarter. I know hospitality was showing a strong recovery last quarter. Did that vertical stall out a little bit as COVID cases ramped up here in August and September? And are there any other end markets that you call out here as being somewhat stronger or weaker than you had expected?\nTodd Schneider: Well, great question, Tim. Certainly, the hospitality business is -- well, so far down, hospitality was -- that it's coming back and it's coming back nicely. I wouldn't use the word stalled out by any stretch. Certainly, there is a bit of a tail to that. So, orders aren't received and shipped in real time, meaning that they make those decisions about staffing. There's a process, they place the orders, we ship them, et cetera. So, there's a little bit of a tail there. But we still like what we see in the hospitality business. Certainly, they are anxious about business travel coming back, convention travel specifically, but the -- in general, the hospitality business is doing so much better. And -- but they're a little bit anxious, right, about how things will be impacted because of the variant, but also when will business travel come back. As far as our other areas, healthcare continues to do well for us. We've talked about those offerings that we have, and they really resonate with those folks. So, whether it's helping them clean their facilities, helping with isolation gowns, scrubs, et cetera, all that is very attractive for folks. And I'd just like to take a moment to talk about what we compete with in those markets, in many cases, is disposables. And with the focus on ESG, that value proposition of providing an item that is essentially relaundered and recycled is very attractive, separate from the economics of it. It's very attractive for the healthcare institutions and many institutions to say, \"Well, you can provide me a product that doesn't just go to landfill after a use.\" So again, that value proposition is very much resonating.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andy Wittmann with R. W. Baird.\nAndy Wittmann: Great. I don't usually ask about the Direct Sales segment, but I'm going to this quarter. The segment margins in All Other came out very strong. We haven't seen them this strong in a while, obviously, plus 68%. It's a big number, but we all know that the compare was fairly easy. Todd, could you just talk a little bit about what drove the margin leverage? Was there an unusually large order that came back with somebody kind of redressing folks? Or maybe just a little bit of color what -- as to what drove the great profit margins in the All Other reportable segment?\nTodd Schneider: Well, Andy, first off, thanks for your question. Our partners in that area of the business really appreciate you calling it out and citing that their performance is really, really good. You're right. The comps are -- were more than reasonable because of what happened to the hospitality business, in particular, last summer. But our revenue is coming back very nicely there, hence, the revenue growth. But -- and we're getting leverage over the organization staffing levels that we have in place, and Mike cited that we had sale of an asset that occurred in that area. So -- but in total, if you put it all together, we see -- you shouldn't anticipate that level of increase in the future. But nevertheless, we like the leverage we have there and we think we're well positioned. Our organization is -- was as you can imagine right-sized as a result of what occurred last summer, and we think we're in a really good spot and to capture opportunities in the marketplace and gain leverage on our investment.\nMike Hansen : Well, the other half or part of that All Other segment is the Fire business, which also had a great first quarter. And so, we're very pleased with that business and the momentum in that business as well. We saw some nice sequential improvement in the gross margin of the Fire business. And at organic growth of 17.8%, we're thrilled with the performance that we've seen.\nAndy Wittmann: Yes. Okay. And then I guess, just for my follow-up question, I wanted to just get a little bit more specific on the labor market, both as it relates to your own business, your ability to hire and compensate people as well as the impact on your customers. I don't know if there's a way for you guys to talk to us about the level of staffing at your -- you're always selling new business, but the historical customers that you've had through this whole time, what does the headcount look like for those customers? Are they still -- can you quantify how far down they are? I mean we talked about the 5 million jobs that are still missing. How many of those were former Cintas wearers?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Andy, first of all, you can't open up a newspaper without hearing about wages and pressure in the market on labor. So, we are certainly not immune from that nor are our customers. And so, we are battling it every single day and staffing at levels that we feel very good about in our business. And as far as our customers, I mean it's really difficult to say -- to put a number on it. It varies so much based upon geographies and industries, because the restaurant business is certainly -- they're nowhere near back to where I think they -- hopefully will be someday and certainly not back to where they were pre-COVID, as an example, warehousing and distribution is back very, very nicely and probably at or above pre-COVID levels. In total, we're certainly down from pre-pandemic levels, and I think we're representative of the 5-point-something million jobs that we have less in the U.S. versus pre-COVID. So, we're anxious for our customers to get back to previous levels. And when we think about labor, and we think about those functions, we always focus more about how it impacts our customers, we'll figure things out and how to manage it.\nPaul Adler: On not only 5.3 million jobs lost, right, versus pre-pandemic, but still 10 million, 11 million job openings that haven't been filled, which is great opportunity for us as you know.\nTodd Schneider: Yes. The latest number I saw from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that they reported out earlier this month was 10.9 million job openings. So I don't know how many of those would be people that would wear a Cintas uniform and utilize items out of our first aid cabinets, et cetera. But we'd like to see those all be filled.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.\nManav Patnaik: I just had one question for you guys. And I was just hoping, you talked about wage and labor a bit, but can you just talk about the moving pieces on the cost side? We've heard a lot about driver shortages and fuel costs and supply chain. I was just hoping you guys could just give us a quick state of what's happening with you guys?\nTodd Schneider: So Manav, I'll start, and then Mike can assist with this. Certainly, energy costs are increasing. We're seeing that, whether it's at the pump, natural gas to run our facilities. But we've worked really hard on efficiencies in routing and in our production facilities to maximize efficiencies there to mitigate all of that. And we're -- I think we're doing a very good job there. Wages, we talked a little bit about. But we have discussed in previous earnings calls that we've been addressing this wage issue with particular focus on our frontline partners over the past couple of years. So we weren't flat footed when it came into this wage subject. We're continuing to address it. We've got to be very competitive in the marketplace to attract the right partners on our team, and we're doing that. And we're going to be able to continue to navigate that successfully. And then as you can imagine, we've been very diligent about managing discretionary spend. There is some travel that is back, but certainly not near the levels that they were pre-COVID. Mike, anything else?\nMike Hansen : No, I think that hits the cost side, but Manav also keep in mind, we talked a little bit about this in July. But we have begun to increase prices here in the first quarter. It's a strategic local customer-by-customer view but early indications suggest a positive reception from our customer base. And certainly, that's important as we look at things, like energy being up 40 basis points year-over-year. We're not immune to some inflationary pressures, but we are -- as Todd said, we're managing them very, very diligently. We're looking for automation opportunities, efficiency opportunities. And if we need to, we can strategically increase prices and we've started to do that here in this first quarter after taking a few years off.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And actually, maybe if I can squeeze in one more. Just hoping you could give us an update on the M&A pipeline perhaps in the non-uniform businesses? Like are there opportunities that you guys are actively seeking?\nTodd Schneider: Great question, Manav. We're active and acquisitive in every business we're in. We'll say that activity has ramped up here in the back half of the year, probably anticipation of tax changes, et cetera. But nevertheless, some. So we like the activity. We've -- we have -- we are in a great financial position. We love our balance sheet and right after investing in our existing facilities to help grow those organizations, our #2 use of capital is for M&A. And so we're very acquisitive and looking very active, and looking forward to closing on more deals in the near future.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: I just wanted to follow up on pricing. You had mentioned you hadn't taken pricing for a while, I think, maybe 2 years or 18 months or whatever. And I think you just referenced you're beginning to take price now. What kind of price is baked into your guidance? And how are the customer conversations? I assume customers see inflation headlines all over the place. So -- and given you have an increased pricing for a while, could you maybe talk about order of magnitude? Are you doing a pricing catch-up? Or how should we think about pricing strategy?\nTodd Schneider: Hamzah, I wouldn't think of it as a catch-up. And we had not raised price in 2 years. But these are -- Mike mentioned, these are strategic decisions. Their pricing is a local subject. It really gets down to what type of what industry is that business in, what even geography are they in, and what condition of their -- is their business and to be able to handle it, so that we're able to be fair with our customers as we look out. Meaning, that there are certain organizations that are -- their business is doing a whole lot better than others. And we're conscious of that. But as far as the conversations, again, that would depend upon the particular business. But it does make the conversation easier when inflation is so much in the headlines. So that certainly gives us a little benefit. But these conversations are -- they're never easy, right? Because from our customer standpoint, it's a tough subject. And -- but we're focused on the long-term value of those customer relationships, and we handle them appropriately.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question would just be around -- just the -- I know it's been a while since the SAP implementation was completed but then COVID hit, and we were sort of caught up in that, and it's still kind of going on. But maybe you could just give some examples on how the SAP system is maybe benefiting you now as organic growth comes back? Maybe if you want to talk about it qualitatively or quantitatively, however, either on the cost side or revenue side? Any examples would kind of be helpful.\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Hamzah. So a few items on SAP that where we're benefiting from. Certainly, one view of the customer is significant for us. And that helps us with cross-sell. And we know when we do that, when we are able to provide more products and services, the customer sees more value. And when they see more value, it's a better retention tool for us. So that's been significant for us and has been and will continue to be moving forward. We get some other -- certainly advantaged from a data analytics standpoint, the cash cycle, those types of subjects. But some other items that I think you might be able to see out in the marketplace is routing efficiencies are a real opportunity for us. We are focused on that from a dollar efficiency from our ambition on the 2050 net zero emissions. And we see we can advance that subject, advance all much further than we have in the past by bringing technology to that. So that will be exciting. The other item is with SAP, it allows for us to have an online experience for our customers that they haven't had in the past. And what we realized is that our customers want -- they don't all want to communicate with us the way that they did when I started with the company 32 years ago, meaning they don't want to just have to call during working hours. They want to do business when they want to do business, whether that's to pay a bill, whether that's to communicate a request, to order something, those types of items are all -- we want to make it easier to do business with us. And on our online presence, and we call it My Cintas, allows for our customers to do just that. So providing more value to them, more conduits for them to communicate with us, instead of having to do it in the old traditional nine-to-five type model. So those are significant for us. Another operational item would be our ability to speed up the process from when we see an order from a customer -- receive an order from a customer to when we can get it out to them. Having that transparency throughout our supply chain, is an absolute advantage where we can anticipate better. And even once we receive the order, get it out the door faster than what we were historically. And so that efficiency shows up to the customer in speed to market and then able to get them products and faster than we had in the past. So we want to leverage that system. And I think we've done that quite nicely to date, but there will be more coming.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Revenue growth in the quarter was stronger than you expected on a sequential basis. Can you elaborate on the sources of upside, specifically? And where you see the most promising trends over the next year?\nTodd Schneider: George, I'll start, but I'd say two significant drivers of growth for us have been new business. It's still quite robust. Our value proposition is resonating very much. And many companies are still struggling with staffing as we cited earlier, 10.9 million job openings. And when you're struggling with staffing and you can find a company like Cintas, you can outsource certain functions too, it makes it very attractive. So they look at it and say, wow, you can take care of these items and maybe they were a do-it-yourself in the past, so that resonates with them. So that's been quite nice. Most of -- and moving on to another driver, most of our customers were, I'd say, are open and probably were open going into the first quarter. But we are providing more products and services to them. We are, again, anxious for them to get back to their pre-employment levels and we think that will be even better. But new business and then I'd say, again, adds within our current customers are two significant drivers for us that we think will continue to help us throughout the year.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful color. And then I wanted to dive into pricing increases, which you touched on earlier. To what extent do you think that pricing combined with efficiencies can fully offset the input cost increases that you're seeing? And could there be a timing lag as to when those pricing increases will take effect and the real-time nature of the input cost increases that you're seeing now?\nMike Hansen : Yes, George, certainly, timing, it is difficult to match up the timing exactly to when costs increase match up the timing exactly to when costs increase and when we see changes in the supply chain, for example. But we're doing our best to manage. And the -- as I mentioned a little bit ago, when we have those conversations today, the message resonates that look, there are increases in cost and these price increases, when we do make them, they are reasonable and they make sense to our customers. That's been our experience so far. The really nice thing about our -- if you think about our cost structure as well, Todd hit on this a little bit, that our labor, we've been working on that for a while. And so we may not be -- while not immune, we may not be as affected as some of our peers and others. And so that's important for us. The other part is that many of our material costs are amortized. So when we see spikes in supply chains in various areas, whether it is labor throughout the world or cotton or other things, we're amortizing costs and it tends to be a bit of a natural hedge for us. And so it does slow down the impact and it requires the impact to be greater for a much longer period of time before it really starts to hit us. And in those cases, we can get ahead of the inflationary pressures a little bit with our pricing strategy. So generally speaking, we feel like we're -- while it's not perfect matching of expense and benefit, we do a pretty good job and we get a little bit of benefit from just the way our business works.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC.\nAshish Sabadra : Mike, I just wanted to drill down further on the cross-sell opportunities that you mentioned. I was wondering if you could provide any color on where you are in penetrating, let's say, hygiene products, safety as well as first aid and fire services within your existing customer base? And how can you accelerate that cross-sell either through organic or through M&A? Any color on those fronts?\nTodd Schneider: Ashish, thanks for the comments and the question. We have our sales and service organization well positioned to offer the various products and services. Again, they have tools that allow them to understand where those opportunities exist. They're certainly not perfect, but they are allowing them to get pointed in the right direction to help provide that value to the customers. And as I mentioned, the more value -- excuse me, more products and services we provide the customer, we know the stickier that, that relationship will be just like most relationships, right? If it's just one product, it's probably more at risk than having two and so on and so forth. So it's very much a point of focus. When you think about our relationships, every single customer virtually needs, our fire surface, right, because of the legal requirements around that subject. But we see very nice overlap with those who would -- who are uniform customers who would need some direct sale their uniform rental. And we also see overlap with those who are uniform rental customers who would need first aid and safety products, training, CPR, all the various items that we provide. So it's -- our big issue has been in the past that our customers weren't aware of everything we provided. And that's a nice problem to have, but nevertheless, it's still very much a problem for us. And we're trying to change that position in the marketplace that our customers realize that not just through our sales and service organization but also through our mass media spend, which you may have seen this past weekend where we had a significant position on -- in golf's Ryder Cup, where we're trying to get the message out about all the products and services we provide. And not a complete one-stop shop for a business, but we sure do get them a long ways on that path. Mike, anything else on this?\nMike Hansen : Well, the only thing I would add is the really good news is we're in the early innings of penetration. And so when you think about the rental customers and the opportunity to continue to penetrate with even rental items, such as our restroom products and our things that we've talked about recently in the last year, like isolation gowns and hand sanitizers, we're in the very early innings. And when you couple that with the first day of safety and fire opportunities again, less than 20% penetration. And so we've got a lot of work to do and a so we've got a lot of work to do and a exciting thing is much opportunity remains.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. That's great. And maybe just a quick clarifying question. I was just wondering at a very high level, can you provide what are the key categories of spend and the percentage of expenses from labor versus fuel versus amortization of equipment? Any color would be helpful.\nMike Hansen : Sure. Let me start with energy. So energy, and that would include fuel for our trucks and the running of our laundry operations, in the quarter was 2.1%. That is up 40 basis points from a year ago, flat with our fourth quarter. So it's a -- while it is up some, it's still a relatively insignificant part of our overall cost structure. When you think, Ashish, about our cost structure, though, you can -- I'm going to use cost of rentals. You can think about it in 3 buckets, the cost of the materials, the cost of running the laundries and then the cost of the service component. And while they're not exactly the same, you can think about them as 1/3 each. And each of those buckets are a little bit different. I mentioned the materials, many of which we amortize over certain periods of time. So we get a little bit of smoothing of those costs. And then we also have some that are direct sale type like the restroom products that we expensed immediately. The major component of that would be those rental items that we're amortizing. When you think about the laundries, then you're -- then we're into the depreciation of the buildings and certainly, the equipment that's in our wash alleys, but also the labor component within that as well. And then the service component, you've got our drivers, our trucks and the amortization of the trucks and the gas to run those. When you put it all together, certainly, labor is a large part of our cost structure. The materials, the products that we sell are certainly a large part of our structure. And we manage each one of those quite tightly and look for improvement opportunities.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nJeffrey Goldstein: This is actually Jeff on for Toni. I know this question was asked earlier related to revenue guidance, but I wanted to ask it slightly different as it relates to EPS. The EPS guide is up by about 2% for the full year, but it seems like a lot of that is maybe flowing through the buybacks and a better-than-expected tax rate. So is that fair? And is that to say from an operating standpoint, maybe you're a little bit more optimistic on the revenue side, but maybe some cost headwinds keep you a little conservative here? Just some more color on that would be helpful.\nMike Hansen : Sure, Jeff. I don't think that's a fair reflection of our guidance. You think about our guidance of $10.60 to $10.90 that's a 3.5% to 6.4% increase in annual EPS. But you referred to a lower tax rate, our tax rate is going to -- based on our guide today is going to go up 5.8% compared to '21. Now that's quite a significant impact. And if you think about the 760 basis points that I referred to in my opening remarks, that takes EPS growth from about 11% to 14%. Now certainly, the buyback that we had done in the fourth quarter and the first quarter did create some benefit, but that still gets to a pretax earnings growth in the range of double-digits. And so it's a pretty good year. And then if you kind of move further up, we talked in July about our guidance of implying operating improvement of -- at the low end, 0 basis points to 70 at the high end, we're still right around in that neighborhood in terms of the guidance that we provided today. And keep in mind, that's on the heels of a 310 basis point improvement in operating margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of taxes, I think, is not a great reflection of really what's going on. The guidance on the EPS side is nice, healthy margin improvement, pretax increases of right around double digits and then a higher tax rate that pulls that EPS down. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on that EPS guidance.\nJeffrey Goldstein: No, understood. That was helpful. And then I want to ask about First Aid margins, which were pretty strong in the quarter. Are you able to quantify at all how much PPE is still constraining margins there, just given it's greater than normal mix? And then I guess based on that, how should we think about near-term upside as that rolls off? Like is that really going to kick up in the next few quarters as that roll off? Just kind of overall, if you could talk about the path back to pre-COVID margins in that line of business.\nMike Hansen : Sure. We certainly -- PPE has been a major factor in that business. And Jeff, you're correct in pointing that out. And it was a -- it was really important for our customers over the course of the last year, and we invested quite a bit in inventory to be able to serve the customers, even if it was at a bit of a lower gross margin for us. But we've seen some nice sequential improvement there. Our 44.8% is still lower than our pre-pandemic of, call it, 48-ish percent. And so we're -- we still believe we can get back to those kinds of levels. Now the PPE that we've had over the course of the last year tends to drop off a little bit more quickly than the First Aid comes back because, as Todd and Paul have referenced, we still have a lot of job openings, quite a bit fewer people in the workplace today than pre-pandemic. And so as those people come back and as those job openings get filled, that creates more hands in our first aid cabinets. And that creates some nice momentum. One of the nice things that we really have seen coming out of the last few quarters is our customers and our new customers, so prospects turning into customers, are really seeing the value of keeping their employees safe and healthy, and our First Aid business really allows us to provide that value to them. And so our new business has been really strong in this first aid cabinet space. But it's coming back. And while we like the momentum, we're not there yet. And we do expect to see sequential improvement. And I'll maybe step that back a bit. We expect to see improvement in the year every quarter can be a little bit bumpy here and there. But generally speaking, we continue to look for improved gross margin in that business.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities.\nGary Bisbee: If I could go back to labor for a minute, I think a lot of your comments have been about cost and working on wages. But are you fully staffed both from a service and a sales perspective? And if you had seen any elevated turnover relative to history or had any increased difficulty hiring to support the rebound in growth you're seeing?\nTodd Schneider: Gary, a very good question. I guess the way I'd describe it is, we're having to run at higher RPMs to get the output that we want. So it's harder. There's no doubt about it. Attracting, retaining and developing the talent is core to what we do as a company, and we're working that much harder now to get to the levels that we want to be at. So are we staffed at the levels we want to be at? Yes. Yes, we like our staffing position. Turnover is still very manageable. And I think it speaks to many, many things. Certainly, the total compensation that we provide, the attractive benefits, but it really speaks to the culture and the investment that we put in to people, because for so many partners that have grown up in the company and have and have advanced in the company, and that's part of our culture. So we've always had to be really good at painting a picture for people about this is where you start, but we will invest and develop you. And we're having to work harder at it, but it's still resonating with folks. And so that's where we are now.\nGary Bisbee: Okay. Great. And then on -- you've talked about the PP&E and some of the pandemic-driven sales in first aid and safety. But I think you also had some of that in uniforms handling that stuff through the facilities business. Is -- and I'm not going to ask you when it's going to go away because who knows, but is there a meaningful chunk of revenue there that probably churns off in the future? And what I'm really trying to think through is how that could impact the rate of growth over the next several quarters or whatever in the core uniforms business. Is it elevated? Or is that just not a big deal in the grand scheme of that business?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Gary, what Mike spoke of, it was a significant portion of our First Aid and Safety business. There was certainly some revenue that went through our rental business sold on route, that was for PPE, but nowhere near the amount as a percentage that would go through our First Aid business. So is there some there today? There's a little bit, but it's not significant whatsoever. So -- and as far as when we look out about demand, we're still in a good spot if the demand is there for those types of products and services. We're managing that inventory. And there is still demand. We still hope as a country and as North America, as a world that, that is -- that will be diminishing over the course of the balance of our fiscal year. So our guide takes all that into account. And we're focused on building the core of our business. And -- but if our customers need those types of products and services, we're there for them, and we will help them with this.\nMike Hansen : Gary, I might just add, as you're thinking about -- I believe you referred to the next several quarters, as I said in my opening remarks, we talked last third quarter about $45 million that we did not expect to repeat in our fourth quarter. And so that's going to be -- as you think about the growth of quarter-to-quarter, definitely keep that in mind as a third quarter growth impact.  Now again, as it relates to this PPE, look, the safety and cleanliness themes that we've sold under for years is really resonating. And we certainly believe that those areas will be larger moving forward than pre-COVID and that certainly is exciting for us.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: I want to hone in a little bit on the offsetting efficiencies of the environment in the automation. Just anecdotally, if you could speak to a few things you're doing. I know in Hamzah's question, you talked about SAP and automation of payments and customer facing. Just curious if you could elaborate maybe a little bit on what you're doing in this environment, maybe at facilities or otherwise and some of the longer-term goals of other automation?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Scott. There\u2019s a couple of obvious ones for us. I mentioned routing. That is obviously a significant one that we think is going to pay dividends for us. Scott Farmer always spoke about, we don't generate any revenue when the wheels are turning on our trucks, right? We generate revenue when the wheels stop. And we see an opportunity to improve that efficiency and that we're investing in technology there to do so, and we're excited about the impact that will have not only on our cost structure, but also on our emissions as we move forward. In the production facilities, we are managing very tightly our wash alley and making sure that we have much better efficiencies there, meaning we're tracking very closely the number of loads that go through our facilities versus the quantity that went through pre-COVID on the same playing field, meaning same amount of volume that's going through. And we put some technology in place to help us with that instead of just doing it through elbow grease. And as a result, we're seeing some real benefits there. And again, that will help us in our cost structure, but also in our emissions. And so we're focused on making sure that we're managing that very tightly and we're seeing some benefits there.\nMike Hansen : Yes, I'm not -- one other one I might talk about, I don't know that Todd mentioned the stock rooms in our laundry facilities and the ability to get those automated, and that creates visibility and it creates the opportunity to share. And when we are more efficient in our stockrooms, so let me be clear, our stockrooms are within our -- within all of our rental facilities, they are garment that have been in service already. And so when we are efficient, that means we are reusing garments that are already amortizing in our cost structure. And so that's -- that creates revenue generation out of garments that are either already in our cost structure or maybe have been amortized fully. And so we get some real nice incremental margins when we can more efficiently use those or put back those garments into service. SAP has allowed us to get visibility and to be able to improve the use of those garments within our stockroom. So that's another example, Scott, of something that's really benefiting us.\nScott Schneeberger: Excellent. Sounds good, guys. I appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on -- it sounds like you're very active in M&A, that came up, I think, particularly before calendar year-end, maybe with some consideration for tax implications. But you've done over $1 billion worth of stock buybacks in the fourth and the first quarter here, back to back, and that's just kind of looking back, that's as big, if any, year going back for a while. So I'm just kind of curious how -- the thought process there, if -- it sounds like you're getting closer on some M&A, but it's not really a lot of allocation of capital is going into repurchase. Is that something we should expect to continue?\nTodd Schneider: Scott, we are -- as I mentioned, we're active, and it takes two to dance, and we're seeing more folks at the dance as -- anecdotally, my guess is because of tax reform. And as a result, we think more deals will come through. Now, that being said, we are in a great position on our balance sheet. And we are ready, willing and able to activate that balance sheet as appropriate that is best for the long-term value for our organization. And just as a reminder, the #1 priority for our capital is, has been and will continue to be the investment into our current business to help grow the sales and profits of our organization, whether that's through additional products and services, additional facilities, training, staffing levels, all those is our #1 priority. And then after that, #2 is M&A, and we're steadfast in that commitment, and we'll allocate appropriately. And then thereafter, then we'll return it to the shareholders as available in the form of stock buyback and dividends. And I think we've got a really good track record of managing those priorities appropriately and intelligently for the long-term value.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Speakers, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nPaul Adler: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '22 financial results in the latter half of December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2022 first quarter revenue was $1.9 billion compared to $1.75 billion in last year's first quarter. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.6%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $902.8 million compared to $826.2 million in last year's first quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased 30 basis points to 47.6% for the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 47.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.3% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services; 44.8% for First Aid and Safety Services; 46.1% for Fire Protection Services; and 41.5% for Uniform Direct Sale. Selling and administrative expenses of $508.7 million increased 6.7% compared to last year's first quarter. This increase reflects investments in our sales teams as well as slight incremental travel and meeting expenses, somewhat offset by the sale of assets within our Uniform Direct Sale business. Operating income of $394.1 million increased 12.7%. Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 20.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '22 compared to 20% in the first quarter of fiscal '21. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was 11% compared to 7.8% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '22 was $331.2 million, an increase of 10.4%. Diluted EPS was $3.11, an increase of 11.9% from last year's first quarter. We are increasing our fiscal '22 financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $7.53 billion to $7.63 billion to a range of $7.58 billion to $7.67 billion; and diluted EPS from a range of $10.35 to $10.75 to a range of $10.60 to $10.90. Please note the following regarding our guidance: Fiscal '22 -- our fiscal '22 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 19.5% compared to a rate of 13.7% for fiscal '21. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '22 diluted EPS guidance by about $0.77 and diluted EPS growth by about 760 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or potential tax reform. Guidance assumes an uneven economic recovery caused by the surge in COVID-19 Delta variant. However, guidance does not contemplate significant pandemic-related setbacks such as stay-at-home orders and other restrictions commonly referred to as lockdowns. Finally, when modeling our fiscal '22 financial results by quarter, please note the following regarding last fiscal year's financial results: In last fiscal year second quarter, certain Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating assets were sold. The pretax gain on sale of $18 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses and impacted second quarter operating margin by 100 basis points. The pretax gain and the related tax benefit impacted EPS by $0.25. And in last fiscal year's third quarter, we were able to help our customers respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases by providing them with large supplies of personal protective equipment. We provided more personal protective equipment in that quarter than in any other. Well, the other half or part of that All Other segment is the Fire business, which also had a great first quarter. And so, we're very pleased with that business and the momentum in that business as well. We saw some nice sequential improvement in the gross margin of the Fire business. And at organic growth of 17.8%, we're thrilled with the performance that we've seen. No, I think that hits the cost side, but Manav also keep in mind, we talked a little bit about this in July. But we have begun to increase prices here in the first quarter. It's a strategic local customer-by-customer view but early indications suggest a positive reception from our customer base. And certainly, that's important as we look at things, like energy being up 40 basis points year-over-year. We're not immune to some inflationary pressures, but we are -- as Todd said, we're managing them very, very diligently. We're looking for automation opportunities, efficiency opportunities. And if we need to, we can strategically increase prices and we've started to do that here in this first quarter after taking a few years off. Yes, George, certainly, timing, it is difficult to match up the timing exactly to when costs increase match up the timing exactly to when costs increase and when we see changes in the supply chain, for example. But we're doing our best to manage. And the -- as I mentioned a little bit ago, when we have those conversations today, the message resonates that look, there are increases in cost and these price increases, when we do make them, they are reasonable and they make sense to our customers. That's been our experience so far. The really nice thing about our -- if you think about our cost structure as well, Todd hit on this a little bit, that our labor, we've been working on that for a while. And so we may not be -- while not immune, we may not be as affected as some of our peers and others. And so that's important for us. The other part is that many of our material costs are amortized. So when we see spikes in supply chains in various areas, whether it is labor throughout the world or cotton or other things, we're amortizing costs and it tends to be a bit of a natural hedge for us. And so it does slow down the impact and it requires the impact to be greater for a much longer period of time before it really starts to hit us. And in those cases, we can get ahead of the inflationary pressures a little bit with our pricing strategy. So generally speaking, we feel like we're -- while it's not perfect matching of expense and benefit, we do a pretty good job and we get a little bit of benefit from just the way our business works. Well, the only thing I would add is the really good news is we're in the early innings of penetration. And so when you think about the rental customers and the opportunity to continue to penetrate with even rental items, such as our restroom products and our things that we've talked about recently in the last year, like isolation gowns and hand sanitizers, we're in the very early innings. And when you couple that with the first day of safety and fire opportunities again, less than 20% penetration. And so we've got a lot of work to do and a so we've got a lot of work to do and a exciting thing is much opportunity remains. Sure. Let me start with energy. So energy, and that would include fuel for our trucks and the running of our laundry operations, in the quarter was 2.1%. That is up 40 basis points from a year ago, flat with our fourth quarter. So it's a -- while it is up some, it's still a relatively insignificant part of our overall cost structure. When you think, Ashish, about our cost structure, though, you can -- I'm going to use cost of rentals. You can think about it in 3 buckets, the cost of the materials, the cost of running the laundries and then the cost of the service component. And while they're not exactly the same, you can think about them as 1/3 each. And each of those buckets are a little bit different. I mentioned the materials, many of which we amortize over certain periods of time. So we get a little bit of smoothing of those costs. And then we also have some that are direct sale type like the restroom products that we expensed immediately. The major component of that would be those rental items that we're amortizing. When you think about the laundries, then you're -- then we're into the depreciation of the buildings and certainly, the equipment that's in our wash alleys, but also the labor component within that as well. And then the service component, you've got our drivers, our trucks and the amortization of the trucks and the gas to run those. When you put it all together, certainly, labor is a large part of our cost structure. The materials, the products that we sell are certainly a large part of our structure. And we manage each one of those quite tightly and look for improvement opportunities. Sure, Jeff. I don't think that's a fair reflection of our guidance. You think about our guidance of $10.60 to $10.90 that's a 3.5% to 6.4% increase in annual EPS. But you referred to a lower tax rate, our tax rate is going to -- based on our guide today is going to go up 5.8% compared to '21. Now that's quite a significant impact. And if you think about the 760 basis points that I referred to in my opening remarks, that takes EPS growth from about 11% to 14%. Now certainly, the buyback that we had done in the fourth quarter and the first quarter did create some benefit, but that still gets to a pretax earnings growth in the range of double-digits. And so it's a pretty good year. And then if you kind of move further up, we talked in July about our guidance of implying operating improvement of -- at the low end, 0 basis points to 70 at the high end, we're still right around in that neighborhood in terms of the guidance that we provided today. And keep in mind, that's on the heels of a 310 basis point improvement in operating margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of margin in the previous fiscal year. So to kind of taxes, I think, is not a great reflection of really what's going on. The guidance on the EPS side is nice, healthy margin improvement, pretax increases of right around double digits and then a higher tax rate that pulls that EPS down. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on that EPS guidance. Sure. We certainly -- PPE has been a major factor in that business. And Jeff, you're correct in pointing that out. And it was a -- it was really important for our customers over the course of the last year, and we invested quite a bit in inventory to be able to serve the customers, even if it was at a bit of a lower gross margin for us. But we've seen some nice sequential improvement there. Our 44.8% is still lower than our pre-pandemic of, call it, 48-ish percent. And so we're -- we still believe we can get back to those kinds of levels. Now the PPE that we've had over the course of the last year tends to drop off a little bit more quickly than the First Aid comes back because, as Todd and Paul have referenced, we still have a lot of job openings, quite a bit fewer people in the workplace today than pre-pandemic. And so as those people come back and as those job openings get filled, that creates more hands in our first aid cabinets. And that creates some nice momentum. One of the nice things that we really have seen coming out of the last few quarters is our customers and our new customers, so prospects turning into customers, are really seeing the value of keeping their employees safe and healthy, and our First Aid business really allows us to provide that value to them. And so our new business has been really strong in this first aid cabinet space. But it's coming back. And while we like the momentum, we're not there yet. And we do expect to see sequential improvement. And I'll maybe step that back a bit. We expect to see improvement in the year every quarter can be a little bit bumpy here and there. But generally speaking, we continue to look for improved gross margin in that business. Gary, I might just add, as you're thinking about -- I believe you referred to the next several quarters, as I said in my opening remarks, we talked last third quarter about $45 million that we did not expect to repeat in our fourth quarter. And so that's going to be -- as you think about the growth of quarter-to-quarter, definitely keep that in mind as a third quarter growth impact.  Now again, as it relates to this PPE, look, the safety and cleanliness themes that we've sold under for years is really resonating. And we certainly believe that those areas will be larger moving forward than pre-COVID and that certainly is exciting for us. Yes, I'm not -- one other one I might talk about, I don't know that Todd mentioned the stock rooms in our laundry facilities and the ability to get those automated, and that creates visibility and it creates the opportunity to share. And when we are more efficient in our stockrooms, so let me be clear, our stockrooms are within our -- within all of our rental facilities, they are garment that have been in service already. And so when we are efficient, that means we are reusing garments that are already amortizing in our cost structure. And so that's -- that creates revenue generation out of garments that are either already in our cost structure or maybe have been amortized fully. And so we get some real nice incremental margins when we can more efficiently use those or put back those garments into service. SAP has allowed us to get visibility and to be able to improve the use of those garments within our stockroom. So that's another example, Scott, of something that's really benefiting us."

            "content": "Thank you, Paul. We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2022. First quarter total revenue grew 8.6% and diluted earnings per share or EPS grew 11.9%. Every business, whether goods-producing or services-providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness , or compliance. Every business has a need Cintas can fulfill to help get them Ready for the Workday. Our financial results are indicative of our strong value proposition and vast total addressable market. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue was $1.51 billion, compared to $1.39 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 8.2%. We expected solid growth over the year prior period in which the economy was in a weakened state, but we also made solid progress on a sequential basis. And in total, revenue grew stronger than anticipated. We continued to make measured investments to support our growth. The labor market remains challenging. U.S. still hasn't recovered 5.3 million pre-pandemic jobs. This represents an opportunity for us. Most of our customers are open. However, most are not operating at the same capacity and employment levels as pre-COVID. We are seeing inflationary signs, including higher cost of freight, energy, wages, and supplies. We continue to take actions to minimize the impacts. These include reviewing and challenging our processes and procedures, produce efficiencies, and reduce costs and thoughtfully implementing increases to the pricing of certain products and services in response to higher operational costs. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for first quarter was $199.1 million compared to $204.5 million last year. First quarter revenue was up against a very difficult comparison. In last year's first quarter, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment, or PPE, sales were surging propelling the business to grow organic revenue over 17%. At that time, PPE comprised an outsized percentage of First Aid and Safety Services revenue mix. As discussed on previous earnings calls, the amount of PPE has declined as COVID case counts have fallen from peak levels. However, PPE remains a larger percentage of the revenue mix than it was pre-COVID. Over the same period of time, the recurring First Aid cabinet service business revenue has increased. We welcome this shift in mix because First Aid Cabinet Service business is historically higher profit margin business and more consistent. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All other revenue was $189.7 million compared to $147.7 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 17.8%, and the Uniform Direct Sale business growth rate was 68%. Both businesses benefited in part from increased activity in a period of reduced COVID case counts. Regarding our balance sheet and cash flow, our financial position remains strong. Recently, on September 15, we paid shareholders $98.8 million in quarterly dividends. The amount per share of common stock paid of $0.95 represents a 26.7% increase of the company's previous quarterly dividend. We continue to allocate capital to improve shareholder return. I'm proud of the execution of our employees, whom we call partners. They continue to navigate an unsettled environment by focusing on our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic continues, of course, fueled recently by the surge of the Delta variant. We remain well positioned headed into the fall and winter months to provide potentially life-saving items such as face masks and gloves, provide hygienically-clean garments such as health care scrubs and isolation gowns and conduct services, including hand sanitizer dispensing and sanitizing spray services. Now before turning the call over to Mike, I want to highlight a recent announcement of our ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what's right and challenging ourselves to improve. We view our ambition to achieve this objective as a natural extension. Also, as part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we will soon issue a more robust environmental, social, and governance report. We are committed to protecting the environment, enhancing humanity, and maintaining accountability. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Hey, Tim. It's Todd. Thanks for the question. Well, certainly, our performance in Q1 exceeded our expectations, but we like the momentum that we see in our business. We like the new business, that's as a driver of growth for us. And we're providing more products and services to our customers. So, to those who are open and hopefully will -- they'll be back to full strength here very shortly. But in general, yes, we like the momentum that we see in our businesses. Well, great question, Tim. Certainly, the hospitality business is -- well, so far down, hospitality was -- that it's coming back and it's coming back nicely. I wouldn't use the word stalled out by any stretch. Certainly, there is a bit of a tail to that. So, orders aren't received and shipped in real time, meaning that they make those decisions about staffing. There's a process, they place the orders, we ship them, et cetera. So, there's a little bit of a tail there. But we still like what we see in the hospitality business. Certainly, they are anxious about business travel coming back, convention travel specifically, but the -- in general, the hospitality business is doing so much better. And -- but they're a little bit anxious, right, about how things will be impacted because of the variant, but also when will business travel come back. As far as our other areas, healthcare continues to do well for us. We've talked about those offerings that we have, and they really resonate with those folks. So, whether it's helping them clean their facilities, helping with isolation gowns, scrubs, et cetera, all that is very attractive for folks. And I'd just like to take a moment to talk about what we compete with in those markets, in many cases, is disposables. And with the focus on ESG, that value proposition of providing an item that is essentially relaundered and recycled is very attractive, separate from the economics of it. It's very attractive for the healthcare institutions and many institutions to say, \"Well, you can provide me a product that doesn't just go to landfill after a use.\" So again, that value proposition is very much resonating. Well, Andy, first off, thanks for your question. Our partners in that area of the business really appreciate you calling it out and citing that their performance is really, really good. You're right. The comps are -- were more than reasonable because of what happened to the hospitality business, in particular, last summer. But our revenue is coming back very nicely there, hence, the revenue growth. But -- and we're getting leverage over the organization staffing levels that we have in place, and Mike cited that we had sale of an asset that occurred in that area. So -- but in total, if you put it all together, we see -- you shouldn't anticipate that level of increase in the future. But nevertheless, we like the leverage we have there and we think we're well positioned. Our organization is -- was as you can imagine right-sized as a result of what occurred last summer, and we think we're in a really good spot and to capture opportunities in the marketplace and gain leverage on our investment. Yes, Andy, first of all, you can't open up a newspaper without hearing about wages and pressure in the market on labor. So, we are certainly not immune from that nor are our customers. And so, we are battling it every single day and staffing at levels that we feel very good about in our business. And as far as our customers, I mean it's really difficult to say -- to put a number on it. It varies so much based upon geographies and industries, because the restaurant business is certainly -- they're nowhere near back to where I think they -- hopefully will be someday and certainly not back to where they were pre-COVID, as an example, warehousing and distribution is back very, very nicely and probably at or above pre-COVID levels. In total, we're certainly down from pre-pandemic levels, and I think we're representative of the 5-point-something million jobs that we have less in the U.S. versus pre-COVID. So, we're anxious for our customers to get back to previous levels. And when we think about labor, and we think about those functions, we always focus more about how it impacts our customers, we'll figure things out and how to manage it. Yes. The latest number I saw from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that they reported out earlier this month was 10.9 million job openings. So I don't know how many of those would be people that would wear a Cintas uniform and utilize items out of our first aid cabinets, et cetera. But we'd like to see those all be filled. So Manav, I'll start, and then Mike can assist with this. Certainly, energy costs are increasing. We're seeing that, whether it's at the pump, natural gas to run our facilities. But we've worked really hard on efficiencies in routing and in our production facilities to maximize efficiencies there to mitigate all of that. And we're -- I think we're doing a very good job there. Wages, we talked a little bit about. But we have discussed in previous earnings calls that we've been addressing this wage issue with particular focus on our frontline partners over the past couple of years. So we weren't flat footed when it came into this wage subject. We're continuing to address it. We've got to be very competitive in the marketplace to attract the right partners on our team, and we're doing that. And we're going to be able to continue to navigate that successfully. And then as you can imagine, we've been very diligent about managing discretionary spend. There is some travel that is back, but certainly not near the levels that they were pre-COVID. Mike, anything else? Great question, Manav. We're active and acquisitive in every business we're in. We'll say that activity has ramped up here in the back half of the year, probably anticipation of tax changes, et cetera. But nevertheless, some. So we like the activity. We've -- we have -- we are in a great financial position. We love our balance sheet and right after investing in our existing facilities to help grow those organizations, our #2 use of capital is for M&A. And so we're very acquisitive and looking very active, and looking forward to closing on more deals in the near future. Hamzah, I wouldn't think of it as a catch-up. And we had not raised price in 2 years. But these are -- Mike mentioned, these are strategic decisions. Their pricing is a local subject. It really gets down to what type of what industry is that business in, what even geography are they in, and what condition of their -- is their business and to be able to handle it, so that we're able to be fair with our customers as we look out. Meaning, that there are certain organizations that are -- their business is doing a whole lot better than others. And we're conscious of that. But as far as the conversations, again, that would depend upon the particular business. But it does make the conversation easier when inflation is so much in the headlines. So that certainly gives us a little benefit. But these conversations are -- they're never easy, right? Because from our customer standpoint, it's a tough subject. And -- but we're focused on the long-term value of those customer relationships, and we handle them appropriately. Yes, Hamzah. So a few items on SAP that where we're benefiting from. Certainly, one view of the customer is significant for us. And that helps us with cross-sell. And we know when we do that, when we are able to provide more products and services, the customer sees more value. And when they see more value, it's a better retention tool for us. So that's been significant for us and has been and will continue to be moving forward. We get some other -- certainly advantaged from a data analytics standpoint, the cash cycle, those types of subjects. But some other items that I think you might be able to see out in the marketplace is routing efficiencies are a real opportunity for us. We are focused on that from a dollar efficiency from our ambition on the 2050 net zero emissions. And we see we can advance that subject, advance all much further than we have in the past by bringing technology to that. So that will be exciting. The other item is with SAP, it allows for us to have an online experience for our customers that they haven't had in the past. And what we realized is that our customers want -- they don't all want to communicate with us the way that they did when I started with the company 32 years ago, meaning they don't want to just have to call during working hours. They want to do business when they want to do business, whether that's to pay a bill, whether that's to communicate a request, to order something, those types of items are all -- we want to make it easier to do business with us. And on our online presence, and we call it My Cintas, allows for our customers to do just that. So providing more value to them, more conduits for them to communicate with us, instead of having to do it in the old traditional nine-to-five type model. So those are significant for us. Another operational item would be our ability to speed up the process from when we see an order from a customer -- receive an order from a customer to when we can get it out to them. Having that transparency throughout our supply chain, is an absolute advantage where we can anticipate better. And even once we receive the order, get it out the door faster than what we were historically. And so that efficiency shows up to the customer in speed to market and then able to get them products and faster than we had in the past. So we want to leverage that system. And I think we've done that quite nicely to date, but there will be more coming. George, I'll start, but I'd say two significant drivers of growth for us have been new business. It's still quite robust. Our value proposition is resonating very much. And many companies are still struggling with staffing as we cited earlier, 10.9 million job openings. And when you're struggling with staffing and you can find a company like Cintas, you can outsource certain functions too, it makes it very attractive. So they look at it and say, wow, you can take care of these items and maybe they were a do-it-yourself in the past, so that resonates with them. So that's been quite nice. Most of -- and moving on to another driver, most of our customers were, I'd say, are open and probably were open going into the first quarter. But we are providing more products and services to them. We are, again, anxious for them to get back to their pre-employment levels and we think that will be even better. But new business and then I'd say, again, adds within our current customers are two significant drivers for us that we think will continue to help us throughout the year. Ashish, thanks for the comments and the question. We have our sales and service organization well positioned to offer the various products and services. Again, they have tools that allow them to understand where those opportunities exist. They're certainly not perfect, but they are allowing them to get pointed in the right direction to help provide that value to the customers. And as I mentioned, the more value -- excuse me, more products and services we provide the customer, we know the stickier that, that relationship will be just like most relationships, right? If it's just one product, it's probably more at risk than having two and so on and so forth. So it's very much a point of focus. When you think about our relationships, every single customer virtually needs, our fire surface, right, because of the legal requirements around that subject. But we see very nice overlap with those who would -- who are uniform customers who would need some direct sale their uniform rental. And we also see overlap with those who are uniform rental customers who would need first aid and safety products, training, CPR, all the various items that we provide. So it's -- our big issue has been in the past that our customers weren't aware of everything we provided. And that's a nice problem to have, but nevertheless, it's still very much a problem for us. And we're trying to change that position in the marketplace that our customers realize that not just through our sales and service organization but also through our mass media spend, which you may have seen this past weekend where we had a significant position on -- in golf's Ryder Cup, where we're trying to get the message out about all the products and services we provide. And not a complete one-stop shop for a business, but we sure do get them a long ways on that path. Mike, anything else on this? Gary, a very good question. I guess the way I'd describe it is, we're having to run at higher RPMs to get the output that we want. So it's harder. There's no doubt about it. Attracting, retaining and developing the talent is core to what we do as a company, and we're working that much harder now to get to the levels that we want to be at. So are we staffed at the levels we want to be at? Yes. Yes, we like our staffing position. Turnover is still very manageable. And I think it speaks to many, many things. Certainly, the total compensation that we provide, the attractive benefits, but it really speaks to the culture and the investment that we put in to people, because for so many partners that have grown up in the company and have and have advanced in the company, and that's part of our culture. So we've always had to be really good at painting a picture for people about this is where you start, but we will invest and develop you. And we're having to work harder at it, but it's still resonating with folks. And so that's where we are now. Yes, Gary, what Mike spoke of, it was a significant portion of our First Aid and Safety business. There was certainly some revenue that went through our rental business sold on route, that was for PPE, but nowhere near the amount as a percentage that would go through our First Aid business. So is there some there today? There's a little bit, but it's not significant whatsoever. So -- and as far as when we look out about demand, we're still in a good spot if the demand is there for those types of products and services. We're managing that inventory. And there is still demand. We still hope as a country and as North America, as a world that, that is -- that will be diminishing over the course of the balance of our fiscal year. So our guide takes all that into account. And we're focused on building the core of our business. And -- but if our customers need those types of products and services, we're there for them, and we will help them with this. Good morning, Scott. There's a couple of obvious ones for us. I mentioned routing. That is obviously a significant one that we think is going to pay dividends for us. Scott Farmer always spoke about, we don't generate any revenue when the wheels are turning on our trucks, right? We generate revenue when the wheels stop. And we see an opportunity to improve that efficiency and that we're investing in technology there to do so, and we're excited about the impact that will have not only on our cost structure, but also on our emissions as we move forward. In the production facilities, we are managing very tightly our wash alley and making sure that we have much better efficiencies there, meaning we're tracking very closely the number of loads that go through our facilities versus the quantity that went through pre-COVID on the same playing field, meaning same amount of volume that's going through. And we put some technology in place to help us with that instead of just doing it through elbow grease. And as a result, we're seeing some real benefits there. And again, that will help us in our cost structure, but also in our emissions. And so we're focused on making sure that we're managing that very tightly and we're seeing some benefits there. Scott, we are -- as I mentioned, we're active, and it takes two to dance, and we're seeing more folks at the dance as -- anecdotally, my guess is because of tax reform. And as a result, we think more deals will come through. Now, that being said, we are in a great position on our balance sheet. And we are ready, willing and able to activate that balance sheet as appropriate that is best for the long-term value for our organization. And just as a reminder, the #1 priority for our capital is, has been and will continue to be the investment into our current business to help grow the sales and profits of our organization, whether that's through additional products and services, additional facilities, training, staffing levels, all those is our #1 priority. And then after that, #2 is M&A, and we're steadfast in that commitment, and we'll allocate appropriately. And then thereafter, then we'll return it to the shareholders as available in the form of stock buyback and dividends. And I think we've got a really good track record of managing those priorities appropriately and intelligently for the long-term value."

The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 10.3%. We are pleased with these fourth quarter results, where each of our businesses continue to grow and execute at a high level, especially coming off our highest growth quarter in fiscal '22.  Fourth quarter gross margin was $1.09 billion. Gross margin increased 210 basis points from 45.6% to 47.7%, an increase of 15.1% over the prior year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 of $470.8 million, increased 16.4% over the prior year. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 20.6% from 19.5% in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income was $346.2 million, an increase of 17.6%.  Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.33, an increase of 18.5% over the prior year fourth quarter. These results conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following: Fiscal year '23 revenue was a record $8.82 billion, an increase of 12.2%. Organic growth was also 12.2% for the year. We saw double-digit organic growth for every quarter during fiscal '23.  We were once again named to the prestigious Fortune 500 for the sixth consecutive year. It is an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. Operating income grew 13.6% for the year. When you exclude both fiscal '22, $12.1 million gain on the sale of operating assets and a $30.2 million gain on an equity method investment transaction, operating income grew 16.7%. EPS grew 11.5% for the year, excluding the previously mentioned prior year gains, EPS grew 15.2%. We increased our quarterly per share dividend by 21.1%. We've increased our dividend every year since going public, which is 39 consecutive years. As part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our third environmental, social and governance, or ESG report. Each year, we continue to make the report more robust. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what is right and challenging ourselves to improve. We're proud of these results and the efforts of our employees whom we call partners.  I'll now turn the call over to Mike, to provide details of our fourth quarter results.\nJ. Michael Hansen: Thank you, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal '23 fourth quarter revenue was $2.28 billion compared to $2.07 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 10.3%. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.77 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 9.1%. As we've done in the past, I will share revenue mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, there can be small fluctuations in mix between quarters. Uniform Rental was 48%, dust [ph] was 18%, hygiene was 16%, shop towels were 4%, linen, which includes microfiber wipes, towels and aprons was 10%, and catalog revenue was 4%. These percentages are consistent with last year, which speaks to the robust demand across all of our products and services. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $249.8 million compared to $218.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 14.1%. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $261.5 million compared to $226.2 million last year. The fire business revenue was $173.5 million, and the organic revenue growth rate was 17.3% resulting in a strong finish to the year. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $88 million, and the organic growth rate was 11.5%. This strong performance exceeded our expectations as robust demand continued for these products and services. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.09 billion, compared to $946.2 million last year, an increase of 15.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 45.6% last year, an increase of 210 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 65 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services help generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.7% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 51% for First Aid and Safety Services, 47.9% for Fire Protection Services and 36% for Uniform Direct sale.  Fourth quarter SG&A was 27.1%, which was up 100 basis points from last year. We've continued to invest in selling resources and branding initiatives, and our insurance costs were higher. We are self-insured, which means our insurance costs can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Fourth quarter operating income was $470.8 million compared to $404.4 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 20.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 19.5% in last year's fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.4% compared to 22.8% last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $346.2 million compared to $294.5 million last year. This year's fourth quarter diluted EPS was $3.33 compared to $2.81 last year. I'll now turn the call back over to Todd to provide his thoughts and our financial expectations for fiscal '24.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. As we move into fiscal '24, we will celebrate our 40th anniversary of being a publicly traded company. Back then, we were excited about what laid ahead. Today, we are equally excited about the significant opportunities that the future holds. Our value proposition remains strong, and our prospects for continued profitable growth are great. Every business goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. We work with businesses to help them build a better workday. We provide the products and perform the services better, faster and more economically freeing businesses to concentrate on their core competency.  A year ago, I introduced three priorities: branding, ESG and technology to help drive our focus, continue to differentiate us in the marketplace and provide increased competitive advantages. I'm pleased with our progress in each of these key areas. Our branding efforts continue as more and more businesses have learned how we can help them get ready for the workday. We continue to make progress on our ESG goals and our sustainable solutions focus on reducing, reusing, recycling and repurposing our textiles. These solutions continue to resonate with our customers and prospects as we help them achieve their sustainability initiatives. I want to spend a minute speaking about technology, in particular, our digital transformation journey. We've been very successful thus far in using technology to drive efficiencies in our production facilities, efficiencies out on the routes with our trucks via our proprietary Smart Truck technology, and we are in the early innings of our My Cintas customer portal, which makes it easier for our customers to do business with us.  As we look to the future, we're very excited to have great technology partners in SAP and Verizon, which are helping us to provide a better customer experience and improve efficiencies within our business. We are excited to announce today that we have an additional strategic technology partner with Google, leveraging their Google Cloud platform. As a result of these relationships, it positions us at the forefront of technology innovation.  We are still in the very early stages of our digital transformation journey, and we are excited about the impact it will have on our customers and our company in total. We are confident technology will be a competitive advantage for us now and well into the future. I will now provide our guidance for fiscal '24. Our fiscal year '24 -- for our fiscal year '24, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion, a total growth rate of 6.1% to 7.8%. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $13.85 to $14.35, a growth rate of 6.6% to 10.5%. Please note the following: fiscal year '24 interest expense is expected to be approximately $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal year '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt. This may change as a result of future share buybacks or acquisition activity. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3% compared to a rate of 20.4% for fiscal '23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. And guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. We're excited about next year and beyond. The future of Cintas remains bright.  I'll turn the call back over to Jared.\nJared Mattingley: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up as needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. I'd like to talk about net realized price as part of the organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and into the guide. And I think you might need to remind me, I think there's no explicit gas surcharge that Cintas puts on, but obviously, gas prices are down year-over-year. And how does that factor into pricing? And just overall, how has Cintas done in terms of raising price to their B2B customers versus the input costs?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Andrew, thanks for the question. Yes, good question. We're -- from a pricing standpoint, as we have spoken about in past quarters, is our pricing has been certainly above historical during fiscal '23, as it needed to be because of the cost inputs. When we think about what that will look like moving forward in our '24 guide, we expect that pricing will return closer to historical and our cost inputs are in a similar spot, as you saw in the CPI report that came out yesterday and the PPI report that came out this morning. We are seeing inflation coming down. I think our team has done a pretty amazing job of managing input costs, both our operational team but our supply chain team which has really benefited us. So it's -- we do not rely upon pricing as the only lever to gain leverage to expand margin. We are committed to extracting out inefficiencies in our business, and you're seeing that. And you've seen that in fiscal '23. And our guide for fiscal '24 reflects incremental -- attractive incremental margins, and we're going to do it successfully, and we're going to expect that inefficiencies in our business to help us expand margins.\nJ. Michael Hansen: Thank you, Andrew, I might just add two things. One, specifically, we do not have a fuel surcharge. And secondly, you made a comment about our price increases offsetting input costs and I think the best -- the way to think about that is margins in the fourth quarter were up 110 basis points. Margin for the fiscal '23 year were up 70 basis points and our guidance implies margin improvement throughout the range of guidance for next year. So, keep that in mind as we think about pricing versus input costs, et cetera, we're still raising margins, improving margins. \nAndrew Steinerman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank Securities.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, good morning. I wanted to talk about the type of economic or macro environment that you're embedding in your guide. I know you said that significant economic disruptions or downturn is not assumed, but give us a sense of what type of economic environment you're assuming?\nTodd Schneider: Faiza, thank you for the question. We're not guiding towards a significant economic disruption. Trying to predict economic indicators is certainly very challenging. But I can tell you what's going on, what we're seeing in our business, which is we haven't seen much change in our customer behavior.  Our sales productivity is very good. Our customer retention levels remain quite strong. And there is -- there's still really good interest in our products and our services. Know programmers are still going very well. And there's still the majority of the new accounts that we sell. So we like that very much. We like expanding the pie and those customers are seeing value in what we're providing. We also like our vertical strategy that -- the vertical sales strategy that has been working quite nicely for us. So I would say, reasonably so business as usual is what we would expect. We recognize there will be ups and downs in macro environments, but we're not guiding towards anything -- any economic downturn.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you. And then if I could just follow up on the -- you mentioned the Google partnership. Maybe give us a sense of where you see that partnership going over the next few years? What some of the benefits might be as you think about your digital transformation strategy?\nTodd Schneider: Certainly. Our relationship with Google gives us a better, faster, smarter, cheaper way to store our critical data. But we see it as it can do so much more, due in large part because of the relationship that Google has with SAP and the relationship we have with SAP and now Google. As you all know, we have had a very successful relationship with SAP for over a decade now. And we've spoken in the past that it is much more than just a customer vendor relationship. It's a strategic relationship.  So you combine that with just a couple of months ago, SAP and Google announced that they have an expanded partnership. And what that's going to do is it's going to allow our SAP data to be connected with the Google Cloud Data and analytics technology, which will give us access to their advanced AI and machine learning capabilities. So we're excited about that. It's going to -- we think we can benefit for many years to come as this type of relationship.  But you asked Faiza for a few examples. So I'll give you a few to help give a little color around it. We see having these technologies connected, the opportunity to put in front of our sales organization instead of calling, I'll say, more blindly on who to try to sell our services to, we call it next best prospect for our sales team to have real technologies to push in front of them. Here's where you go spend your time. We think that's significant and can have an impact on our productivity and our retention and morale productivity, all those things. Next best product for the customer. So instead of just trying to figure that out, we can put that in front of our sales team to -- and our service team to make sure that they're talking to our customers about the next best product that would fit based upon other customer behaviors. We think certain customer service functions could be enhanced nicely over the coming years. There is -- we all use Google Maps, and we see an opportunity to leverage Google Maps to even further enhance our Smart Truck technology to make routing even more dynamic, which will save us time, saves us energy, saves us -- allows for more time in front of our customers instead of on the road. And then just one more, I would say is that, our service team, we're blessed to have a lot of customers. We want to make sure that they're spending -- they're in front of the right customers at the right time. And we see the potential to leverage that type of technology to point them in the right direction to make sure that they're focused on any at-risk customers and customers that we need to enhance the effort with them with the people in front of them. So hopefully, that gives you a little color around it. Again, this is not -- we don't see this as an event, we see this as a process and the coming years, we think it can be very impactful for our business and our customers.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. \nOperator: Next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to turn down into the First Aid and Safety Services we saw some material acceleration in growth there. I was wondering if you can talk about what's driving that strength. And then as you think about '24 any puts and takes that you would call out? Or how do we think about that momentum going forward? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Ashish. I'll start, and if Mike wants to chime in. The First Aid and Safety business is going quite well. We really like that business. We've -- we see significant opportunities in the future there. And we're getting leverage there, really growth -- the strong growth is really helping us get some real leverage but the mix of business is very attractive. We spoke about during the peaks of the pandemic now, there was more PPE sales and safety sales. And the mix is now back to what we really like, it's a cabinet sale that are repeat in nature and higher margin. So we really like the mix, but the growth in total is great.  And I would tell you that the value proposition is really resonating our customers are trying to make sure that they're reinvesting in their people. Health and wellness is a concept that is resonating very strongly in the marketplace, and we're leveraging that and benefiting from that. And on top of that, we're also -- we have inefficiencies in that business as well. So we're extracting out those inefficiencies. They're going to help us continue to expand our margins. But we like the position we're in, we like the tailwinds we have with the health and wellness, and we think the future is quite bright in that area.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. I just wanted to drill down further on the vertical sales strategy. Obviously, you mentioned you're seeing some pretty good success on that front. I was wondering if you could drill down further on the key verticals. And then also on your health care initiative, how those are trending, but also any other verticals that you would call out? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Certainly. Our key verticals where we're focusing our time is health care, education and government. We've organized around those verticals. We have products and services that are attractive to them. Certain service functions dedicated to them. And as a result, we're really benefiting from it. And we very much think that they're smart verticals to invest in. And as a result, they're growing really attractively. And customer retention is good, new business is good. And we think that there's a real long opportunity here for us to continue to invest in these into the future. Certainly, the demographics of health care are quite attractive. But education and government are doing well in addition, and we're going to continue to invest in those areas. So it's paying dividends for us.\nAshish Sabadra: That\u2019s very helpful color. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Good. I think historically, you've talked about how almost two-thirds of that -- two-thirds of new sales come from those known programmers. I just wanted to update that and kind of tied to that. What is the competitive environment look like? Have there been any changes? Because your two public comps, obviously, there's a lot of changes going on at each of the organizations?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Manav, you were -- I couldn't hear the first part, but I think I understand your question. I'll try to answer it. And if I don't, then please let me know. The know programmers are -- it's going quite well. And it has historically been a significant portion of what we sell, and it continues to be a significant portion of what we sell. And we have products and services that are attractive to them. We have a sales effort that is, I'd say, skilled at identifying and delivering the message to those folks. And I think it's important to understand that with know programmers, it's not always -- I would say rarely is it just all incremental new spend to them. Many, many cases, we are able to -- they're spending those dollars somewhere in many cases, with other vendors, maybe not a direct competitor, but they're spending money on compliance and image and safety and cleanliness, those types of things. And as a result, we're able to redirect those dollars to us, in many cases, save the money. So don't think of it all as, oh my gosh, is there an end to that because if the economy -- there's any stress in it that they're not going to be able to sell know programmers there, quite the opposite. We're -- we see a very, very long runway there. So that's attractive. As far as the competitive set, I mean, we operate in a very competitive industry, a very competitive environment. I would say I haven't seen any changes to the competitive landscape from that standpoint. So I'll leave it at that.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. And then just one quick follow-up I had, I think I understand that the Google partnership the benefits it potentially brings with any sense of time line? Like when does this start happening, when you get the data on the cloud and then you start seeing some of these benefits?\nTodd Schneider: Well, it's certainly going to be a process. We just entered into our relationship with them recently. We've had meetings with them to talk about where we're going to go here. And as I mentioned, it's not an event. It's a process. But we see some low-hanging fruit, I guess is the best way to say it. But as we have gone down this path, more ideas are coming out. So we think we can benefit for years to come with this opportunity. And I won't go into too much detail just because we see some competitive advantages there. And so as a result, we'll keep those to ourselves. But we think the runway is long and attractive.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Chan with UBS.\nJoshua Chan: Hi, good morning, Todd, Mike and Jared, congrats on a strong quarter. My first question, when you are selling First Aid and Fire, basically those adjacent businesses, how much of that growth is selling to existing customers? And how much of it gets you kind of entirely new customers that don't run uniform from you?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Josh, it's a good question. It's a mix. Cross-sell has been very helpful for us over the last number of years and will continue to be. But we love new customers. And the Fire and First Aid, there is some overlap, but not complete overlap. And so it allows us to get into speaking to customers about that. And the first time they may have done business with us at all. So -- and then we -- separately we have an enterprise sales organization that will call a customer or prospect.  And frankly, it doesn't really matter to us what they start with. It's whatever the customer is interested in. If a customer doesn't do any business with us and they want to start -- their interest is in Fire, wonderful, or if it's in First Aid, wonderful, or rental garments, then we go where the interest is and then we expand out that relationship from there. So we love the fact that there isn't complete overlap, and it gets us into new opportunities and then we cross-sell like crazy.\nJoshua Chan: Great. That makes sense. Thanks for the color. And I guess for my follow-up, if I look at your incremental margin, it's climbed pretty steadily through 2023. I assume if you got better alignment between price and cost. So how are you thinking about the cadence of incremental margins looking into 2024?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Josh, our incremental margin for the total company in fiscal '23 was 26.8%, a little bit up from the previous year. And Josh, it's -- there can be ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter in the way that we invest or in the cost that we see. And so we don't necessarily try to predict one quarter at a time. We do certainly believe we can get incremental operating margins in that 20% to 30% range from quarter-to-quarter generally, but it's going to go up and down, again, based on what we are doing within the business, some initiatives that we may or may not roll out. So the bigger focus for us is on the full year, and our goal is to get those incremental attractive enough that it improves margins over the year. So I wouldn't call it linear at all, I wouldn't call it flat. It's going to be based on how we're managing the business.\nJoshua Chan: That\u2019s great. Thanks for the color and thanks for your time. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Hauk with R.W. Baird.\nJustin Hauk : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to -- I guess, my first question, maybe a follow-up on Andrew's question, just on the implied revenue growth, the 7% in 2024. And maybe you can kind of pull out the puts and takes, but that's coming off of a 12% you just did here in '23, that was off of already a really strong 10%. 7% is more, I guess, kind of in line with kind of your long-term historical organic growth. And so -- maybe you can just give us the puts and takes. Is it all pricing that accounts for the delta because it sounds like your new business and retention and kind of existing sales are all still very strong? So I'm just trying to understand the moving pieces?\nTodd Schneider: Thanks for the question, Justin. I'll try to answer and see if Mike wants to expand upon it. So when you think about our growth, Q4 growth was around 10%, which is really nice growth, especially considering a strong comp of last year of 12.7%, which was our strongest growth of the year, that year.  So if you compare that 10% to the -- I'll call it the top end of our guide or in the mid-7s to higher 7s, you can think of that as really pricing returning back to closer to historical levels. And as I mentioned earlier, the reason that we see this as appropriate and is we're seeing an easing of inflation. And we saw that -- you can see that in the drop in the cost of energy that we've seen, the benefit we received in Q4. And as I mentioned earlier, also you saw it in the CPI report yesterday and the PPI report today. So -- and as you appropriately said, I mean, we're guiding towards a more historical type of growth volume growth is really good still. Pricing will return closer to historical appropriately so. But all that being said, we will still have -- we're guiding towards incremental margins and operating margin expansion. So pricing is a lever, but it's not our only lever available to us in order to expand margins.\nJustin Hauk: Okay. No, that's helpful. I mean that's I guess, kind of what you were implying, but I wanted to clarify that, that was kind of the magnitude of the change. I guess the second question, just on the insurance cost increase, and maybe SG&A as a percentage of revenue in general, how much of an impact was that in the quarter?  And then is that kind of a run rate headwind that you'll face next year? And the reason why I ask is, obviously, you're implying margin expansion here, but your SG&A as a percentage of revenue is still pretty low versus kind of pre-COVID levels. And so just trying to understand how much structural SG&A leverage gain you have here versus returning to more of a normalized level?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Justin, because we are self-insured, those claims can -- they can kind of move up and down throughout the year. There's nothing that we would say is structural related to that. It's just a product of being self-insured. We ended the year at 26.9% in SG&A, that is, gosh, a couple of 100 basis points maybe lower than pre-COVID in the last few years, and you've heard us speak about this.  Look, we've worked hard to get it to that level, and we don't want to get back to historical levels. So our expectation is we're going to continue to find ways to better leverage SG&A, particularly G&A to make sure that it contributes to our margin expansion into the future. So we're going to continue to work hard to look for opportunities to bring it down and do not expect it to return to those higher 20 places that we were in pre-COVID. \nJustin Hauk: Great. Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll hear next from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned there hasn't been much change in customer behaviors based on what you're seeing. Can you elaborate on how customer budgets, sales cycles in the sales pipeline are evolving with the current environment?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, George. It's a pretty -- the environment hasn't changed significantly. The health of customers is varies based upon geographic, what type of business they're in, small, medium, large, those types of things. But generally speaking, the sales process and has not elongated the sales pipe looks very good. We like the spot we're in. And we have invested appropriately. We're in the right -- we've got the right products and services.  We've got the right focus on our customers, and we think that we're well positioned for the future. And we certainly are trying to make sure that we're planning for the long term. And we're -- as I mentioned earlier, not trying to be an economic forecasting business, but we are making sure that we're watching our business very closely and hoping for clear sailing ahead with the economy. That being said, we will find a way to be successful as we have in the past.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then I wanted to drill down further into your healthcare vertical, which you touched on earlier, COVID certainly provided a notable lift to the health care business. Can you talk a little bit about how quickly the health care business is growing, what new business trends there look like and what mix of revenue we currently represent?\nTodd Schneider: Certainly, George. The healthcare business has been strong for us for a number of years. And is large part not just having a sales focus, but organizing around those customers, products, services, our service organization. So it's more than just sales. It is making sure that we look at it as a business. And it's growing -- it's accretive to our growth rates. We see very long runway there. As I mentioned earlier, the demographics are really attractive. But the pipeline of sales growth looks robust. And that's because of years of investment in making sure we're really well positioned, and we see that continuing.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. And just the mix of revenue?\nJ. Michael Hansen: I don't have that in front of us, George, right now. In the past, it's been about 7%. And it's -- I'd say that it's growing faster than average.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.\nTim Mulrooney: Yes. Good morning. On the First Aid business, specifically, pre-pandemic operating margins were closer to 15%. They went down several 100 basis points. I know from the sell through a lower-margin PP&E in '21 and '22. But now it looks like you're sitting at 19%. I mean that's a big jump from pre-pandemic levels. Would you expect, I guess, Mike or Todd a little bit of a give back at some point? Or do you expect to keep and build on those margin gains that you've made this year?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Tim, we do not expect to give back, we expect to maintain and build on those improvements. And we're leveraging certainly the total growth, the benefits of health and wellness being important to people in the marketplace. The mix of business being attractive and we've fundamentally focused on extracting out inefficiencies in the business. So -- and we're not giving those back. So yes, we see the future is bright for that business. \nTim Mulrooney: Yes. Okay. It was more than just sales mix. It sounds like you did some structural things. \nJ. Michael Hansen: Yeah. Tim, we talk a lot about the mix certainly returning, and that's being -- that's a big part of it. But as Todd mentioned, our first aid safety partners have a lot of things going on in terms of business improvement opportunities from sourcing better, to routing better, to sales productivity improving, to penetration opportunities. There's a lot going on in that business.  And we've attributed a lot, you're correct, to the revenue mix, and that has been important in terms of the height of the pandemic to today. But there's also a lot that's going on in the business that is working towards structural improvements in the business that create long-term efficiencies and you're seeing that. And that's why we don't expect to give it back. There's nothing that we are underspending or underinvesting in to get these margins. These are real business improvements that are sustainable. And that's what we love about the business. It has been growing nicely, it's resonating with our prospects and customers. And it's pretty exciting to think about that business in our fiscal '24 topping $1 billion for the first time. So we do love the business, and there's a lot of good work going on there.\nTim Mulrooney: That is exciting, and I appreciate the extra color there. Mike, that's very clear. If I could just shift gears really quickly. One of your competitors recently commented that they saw customer retention rates come down a little bit recently. But it was kind of more of a normalization, okay, like following a boost over the last several years, when things were good. Now that kind of back towards historical rates. I'm curious and some investors are curious if you guys saw something similar to any material degree, did you see retention rates kind of jump up a little bit in fiscal '22 and '23? And have you seen that pull back or normalize, so to speak, more recently? Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Great question, Tim. So, over the past few years, we've seen a nice improvement to our customer retention levels through the pandemic. We think that we handle that really strategically, intelligently and thought about the long term. And we saw our customer satisfaction scores go up at that same time. And we've continued to see those same levels of customer satisfaction and retention levels.  So no, we have not seen a change from that standpoint. And we're always working on improving our business and making sure that we are super focused on making sure we're taking great care of our customers and staying attentive to their needs, is a big part of what makes us successful. So we've not seen a change, and we're focused on making sure that doesn't happen.\nTim Mulrooney: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Good morning. I wanted to ask your expectations for ad stops as we go into fiscal '24. It seems as though companies are starting to slow down their hiring. And I'm wondering what type of impact that's included in the guidance or what you're anticipating?\nTodd Schneider: Kartik, we have not seen a change to our ad stops metrics, and we are expecting that, that will continue. We're -- part of it is because of the diversity of our customer base, not just good producing services providing and the broadness of our customer base. We're not dependent upon any one particular area and we expect to grow in multiples of GDP. And all that being said, we expect that and stops metrics will continue on its path.\nKartik Mehta: Perfect. And then Mike, you might have said this, so I apologize if you already talked about this. But just the impact from energy costs in FY '24 versus FY '23, what you've included or anticipated.\nJ. Michael Hansen: So let me -- I'll give you a couple of numbers. Fourth quarter total energy for the total company was 1.8% for the fourth quarter. For the year, that was 2.2%. So for the year -- this year -- fiscal '23 compared to '22, it was down 10 basis points. So it's roughly flattish. As we think about '24, look, the prices at the pump spiked in June of last year. And so our first quarter numbers of last year were fairly high. And so we may get a little bit of a tailwind in Q1 and then our expectation is we'll turn roughly flattish. \nKartik Mehta: Okay. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo.\nSeth Weber: Good morning. I wanted to just circle back to the revenue guidance point again for a second. I'm just -- it sounds like First Aid Safety and the Fire business both have very strong momentum, so I'm just trying to understand the construct of the revenue guide, whether you think all three segments will be in that kind of 6% to 8% range or will there be some above and some below to kind of put out to that 6% to 8% range? Because it seems like there's still a lot of momentum in the First Aid Safety and Fire business.\nTodd Schneider: Well, Seth, good morning. We like the momentum in all of our businesses. So will there be some above, some below? Yes. But it's -- but generally speaking, we see in the mid-to-high single digits would be probably where you can think of it. And it's -- and as I mentioned earlier, the -- we're up against comps that are significant, partly because of pricing being above historical in the past, well above historical, now it being closer to historical.\nSeth Weber: Okay. Maybe, Mike, my follow-up question just on CapEx. It's kind of pushing up towards that 4%ish number again. Is that the right way to think about it for fiscal '24? And then can you just give us any color on what that -- whether that's brick-and-mortar or whether just where that spending might be going from a capacity perspective or whatnot?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Sure. Yes, we would expect 3.5% to 4% of revenue. Look, when we've had a really good couple of years of volume growth, we have capacity needs in certain places. Capacity is local in our business, but we have capacity needs. And we want to continue to invest for growth. And so there will be everything from added washers and dryers and specific wash alleys to some of a few bricks and mortar new buildings and other investments in the business that allow us to continue to have the capacity we need to grow. So it is kind of back to that historical 3.5% to 4% range. That would be our expectation.\nSeth Weber: Got it. I appreciate guys. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we'll move next to Heather Balsky with Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I know you've got a question earlier about sort of the trend in sales and the difference is related to pricing. I'm curious, focusing specifically on the uniforms business. You've been growing organically 9% to -- and 11% the last few quarters. If presumably were well past the COVID recovery period. I'm just curious what's enabled you to drive that outperformance versus kind of pre-COVID levels? And if you think that sustainable going forward?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Heather. So yes, our Uniform Rental business is performing quite well. We've -- we think we have invested appropriately in the sales organization. We really like where we're going there. We like the productivity levels. They've continued to go up. And there's plenty of inputs to productivity and it's whether it's products that we launch, services that we launch, the retention levels of our people, the leadership of the organization to make sure that we're driving items that make them more successful.  So no, it's going well, and our service organization is doing an outstanding job with customer retention, making sure, as I mentioned earlier, our customer satisfaction scores are near all-time highs. And as a result of that, our lost business, our customer retention, the appropriate way to say it. Our customer retention is really attractive. So our new is up and our customer retention is improved over pre-COVID levels. So those are big for us and having a really positive impact on the business.\nHeather Balsky: Great. Thank you. That's really helpful. And I feel like I have to ask an AI question here. You guys talked about being early in your digital transformation journey. Are you guys looking at any investments on the AI side in terms of efficiencies and sort of behind the scenes type benefit? I'm just curious. Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Heather, we're certainly investigating and investing in opportunities. And we think we're with the right partners. When you think about Verizon, SAP and Google, having those three as the -- our technology -- our strategic technology partners, we think we're with the right folks. And we don't just have a customer vendor relationship with them, we have a strategic relationship with them, and they're helping us -- they are and will help us to leverage those opportunities in the marketplace.  So I can't lay out specifics for you, but I'll just tell you this, we're -- we see the opportunity to invest in that area, and we are doing so appropriately because we think it will pay big dividends. That being said, it will be -- we'll be speaking about this for many, many years to come because we think the benefit has a real -- has a lot of legs to it. \nHeather Balsky: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Guys, kind of a cautionary question. It sounds like things are going really well and recent economic indicators feel pretty good, but just curious to hear what the plan is if -- as your guidance expects no softness in the economy, how are you looking at what levers would you pull on the efficiency side? What should give us assurance you'll be in good shape if you're not able to get some of the leverage you've been getting on the top line? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Scott, let me make sure I understand. You're saying if we can't get to leverage or if the economic environment changes?\nScott Schneeberger: If the economic environment dips in below kind of status quo and really deteriorate, just curious what kind of leverage you guys would pull to maintain the financial sense?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Certainly. Good question. I -- we have a very tenured, very experienced leadership team, management team that has been through the cycles. It seems like you name it, we've been through it, and we expect to be successful in all environments. Now -- so your -- the question is a tough one to answer because the economic downturn, how deep is it? How long is it? How broad? And so trying to understand that is challenging. But we expect to be successful in all economic environments.  If you're talking about a massive downturn in '08, '09, that might be different. But we're ready. We know how to do this. We have demonstrated our ability to be successful in and all these different types of economic environments. We have grown our sales and profits in 52 -- in the last 54 years. And my expectation is we will absolutely do so and we will find and fight and a way to be successful in whatever economic environment. So plenty of levers available to us. And we think we've got the right team in place to manage that.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. I appreciate that. And then for the follow-up, it's a bit of a two-parter and one to your housekeeping. I was just curious, your -- thanks for answering on Seth's question on CapEx, what that will look like, just other uses of capital as we head into fiscal '24, thoughts on buybacks, thoughts on M&A, any other cleanup on the balance sheet you were considering? And then that second part would just be, if you could remind us what a one day -- one extra workday quantitative impact is that in fiscal '24 versus '23?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Sure. From a capital allocation, I'll start with our expectation is that cash flow is going to continue to be very good in fiscal '24. And secondly, our balance sheet is in great shape. We -- as of May 31, we have no variable debt. And so we can do a lot of things with great cash flow and a great balance sheet. We would love to use that on M&A if the opportunities come along, and we'll be as aggressive as we can be in terms of looking for them and making sure that they come at the right value, but we love that opportunity. Buyback is another great opportunity, again, with good cash flow and a great balance sheet, we can put that cash to work, and we certainly could do it in the form of a buyback. So, look, our capital allocation philosophy and strategy hasn't changed. And with -- again, with a healthy balance sheet and a healthy cash flow, we can do some good things with that as we look forward to fiscal '24. Your second question of the one workday for a fiscal year. In this case, it would be about a 40 basis point benefit to growth -- sales growth. And think about it as about a 12 basis point benefit on bottom line on operating margin.\nScott Schneeberger: Great, thanks. Appreciate all the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolas.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to just ask a little bit more on kind of the hiring environment at your clients. You said you're not expecting it to change. It's been a very strong hiring environment for the last several years since that kind of initial dip in COVID. Is there a way that you think about it in your mind in terms of the strong hiring environment and just kind of clients adding personnel driving some of that revenue growth, particularly in the Rental Uniforms division? Or do you think it's really a lot more of the company's own efforts in terms of cross-selling, finding new customers and pricing? Then I have a follow-up.\nTodd Schneider: Good question, Shlomo. We love it when our customers are hiring more employees and it certainly allows you to swim a little bit downstream then. But we've got to find ways to add value to customers even when they're in the more flattish type environment. That being said, there is still almost 10 million job openings. So that's very encouraging.  We'd love to see those jobs filled. But we are -- we're going to find a way to be successful whether our customers are hiring at rapid rates or at much lower rates, we're going to find a way to be successful. And that is impacted by our ability to -- we would call it cross-sell, bring more value to the customers in other products and services that they may have with maybe a new business unit, but maybe within that business unit just selling more items. So there's a lot of inputs to that and how we categorize it. But we're -- we like the spot that we're in. And we think the products and services and the value proposition that we're providing is resonating with people. And would certainly love the economic to continue or even improve.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Great. And then just on a follow-up. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the margin just on a sequential basis of looking at the First Aid and Safety. And then kind of the other division, you had a sequential decline despite revenue going up in the Rental Uniforms you have continuing to go up? Or was there something particular on the insurance side that hit the other divisions? Or is there some particular investments that are going on right now? Just if you can give a little bit of a sequential color on what's going on with the operating margins?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Sure, Shlomo. Look, the First Aid margin was at 18.8% in Q4, still a really healthy place to be. And nothing noteworthy other than growth is -- organic growth still is very good, gross margin is still very good, and we continue to invest for the future. So nothing noteworthy there. From the all other perspective, the Fire operating margin in Q4 was slightly over 20 and so that's a great place for us in that business. The direct sale business was 3.5%. So quite a bit lower. And that business can move up and down and have a little bit more volatility than the other businesses just because of the nature of it. We still love the business. It grew nicely, but mix can have an outsized effect on that operating margin and it sort of did in the fourth quarter. As we move forward, from a First Aid perspective, we still expect the really positive margins that we've seen as we've discussed a few minutes ago. And we still expect Fire to continue to perform very, very well like it has in fiscal '23.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to follow up on First Aid growth. You talked about the Cabinet business contributing it again, which is great. I was hoping you could talk about, is that sort of an industry penetration is growing? Or is it the product set relatively new. I know you're investing in it during COVID. Have you been sort of incentivizing your sales force to sell more cabinets? And are you taking share? Just wanted to get a sense on how long the sort of 20% growth in cabinets can continue and if there are any other factors you'd call out as well? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Toni. We -- the answer is yes. All the above is what we're doing. We see a long runway in the First Aid business. We're -- the vast majority of what we sell are people that are do-it-yourself. There's -- as you think about, there's 16 million businesses in North America, there is a significant opportunity to sell our First Aid cabinet services, but our other services as well, whether they be AEDs, wash stations, those types of items that really have value to customers. And that health, safety, compliance tailwind, we don't see that changing.  People are investing in their organizations, and we see that as a tailwind for many years to come and the market is really, really big. So that's where we're -- we love the growth that we're seeing in that business, and we're continuing to invest appropriately to make sure that it continues.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. And this should be a short one, but hoping you could talk about maybe the sensitivity of the business from inflation. So presumably, your costs come down as if inflation comes down, so how should we be thinking about maybe like the impact to margin for each point inflation comes down or however you want to frame the sensitivity there? Thanks.\nJ. Michael Hansen: Toni, that's a really difficult thing to try to say one point of inflation equals x points of margin. That's pretty difficult to do. But I'd maybe say this. When you think about our cost structure, we've got a really nice mix of cost types, if you will. So we certainly have things like labor that are impacted by inflationary pressures. And we work very, very hard on that over the course of the last five years, I would say. And we're in a good spot. But then we also have this large part of our cost structure that is amortizing. And it allows us to effectively see any inflationary impacts coming if they are coming and plan for them accordingly. And so we may plan for that in terms of our pricing approach, we may plan for that in terms of other initiatives. But the point is, because we're amortizing those costs, it takes a while for inflation to get to us, and during that period of time, we can plan and we can anticipate better. While we're on that bucket, I would say our global supply chain really does a nice job of not being single sourced. And so when there are some inflationary pressures in various parts of the world or in our supply chain, because we're not single source, we have the ability to move volume a little bit in flex, we have choices. And that's important for us. And it has been important for us over the course of the last two years in the high inflationary environment. And then the third bucket that I would throw out is sort of that infrastructure. We've got a large infrastructure, 400-plus locations around the country. And when we are growing really nicely, we're leveraging it very, very well, and we've done that over the course of the last few years. And so Toni, we're not a product company that is dramatically affected by today's inflation. And you hear us talk about pricing is just one lever that we have to get margin improvement.  And that's because of, number one, we've got this sort of diverse cost structure. And number two, we've got a lot of initiatives and things that we're working on. And it gives us choices. And that's the -- that's really the key for us in terms of fighting inflation. So hopefully, that answers the question. It's not an easy metric for us because of the cost structure that we have and the initiatives that we have, and it also depends on where the inflation comes from.\nToni Kaplan: Super. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Mattingley for any additional or closing remarks.\nJared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter fiscal '24 financial results in September. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

            "name": "Todd Schneider",
            "content": "Thank you, Jared. Fourth quarter total revenue grew 10.1% to $2.28 billion. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 10.3%. We are pleased with these fourth quarter results, where each of our businesses continue to grow and execute at a high level, especially coming off our highest growth quarter in fiscal '22.  Fourth quarter gross margin was $1.09 billion. Gross margin increased 210 basis points from 45.6% to 47.7%, an increase of 15.1% over the prior year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 of $470.8 million, increased 16.4% over the prior year. Operating margin increased 110 basis points to 20.6% from 19.5% in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income was $346.2 million, an increase of 17.6%.  Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.33, an increase of 18.5% over the prior year fourth quarter. These results conclude a fiscal year of significant accomplishments, including the following: Fiscal year '23 revenue was a record $8.82 billion, an increase of 12.2%. Organic growth was also 12.2% for the year. We saw double-digit organic growth for every quarter during fiscal '23.  We were once again named to the prestigious Fortune 500 for the sixth consecutive year. It is an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. Operating income grew 13.6% for the year. When you exclude both fiscal '22, $12.1 million gain on the sale of operating assets and a $30.2 million gain on an equity method investment transaction, operating income grew 16.7%. EPS grew 11.5% for the year, excluding the previously mentioned prior year gains, EPS grew 15.2%. We increased our quarterly per share dividend by 21.1%. We've increased our dividend every year since going public, which is 39 consecutive years. As part of our steadfast commitment to corporate responsibility, we issued our third environmental, social and governance, or ESG report. Each year, we continue to make the report more robust. Cintas was founded on a sustainable business model. Our corporate culture is based on doing what is right and challenging ourselves to improve. We're proud of these results and the efforts of our employees whom we call partners.  I'll now turn the call over to Mike, to provide details of our fourth quarter results. Thank you, Mike. As we move into fiscal '24, we will celebrate our 40th anniversary of being a publicly traded company. Back then, we were excited about what laid ahead. Today, we are equally excited about the significant opportunities that the future holds. Our value proposition remains strong, and our prospects for continued profitable growth are great. Every business goods producing or services providing has a need for image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. We work with businesses to help them build a better workday. We provide the products and perform the services better, faster and more economically freeing businesses to concentrate on their core competency.  A year ago, I introduced three priorities: branding, ESG and technology to help drive our focus, continue to differentiate us in the marketplace and provide increased competitive advantages. I'm pleased with our progress in each of these key areas. Our branding efforts continue as more and more businesses have learned how we can help them get ready for the workday. We continue to make progress on our ESG goals and our sustainable solutions focus on reducing, reusing, recycling and repurposing our textiles. These solutions continue to resonate with our customers and prospects as we help them achieve their sustainability initiatives. I want to spend a minute speaking about technology, in particular, our digital transformation journey. We've been very successful thus far in using technology to drive efficiencies in our production facilities, efficiencies out on the routes with our trucks via our proprietary Smart Truck technology, and we are in the early innings of our My Cintas customer portal, which makes it easier for our customers to do business with us.  As we look to the future, we're very excited to have great technology partners in SAP and Verizon, which are helping us to provide a better customer experience and improve efficiencies within our business. We are excited to announce today that we have an additional strategic technology partner with Google, leveraging their Google Cloud platform. As a result of these relationships, it positions us at the forefront of technology innovation.  We are still in the very early stages of our digital transformation journey, and we are excited about the impact it will have on our customers and our company in total. We are confident technology will be a competitive advantage for us now and well into the future. I will now provide our guidance for fiscal '24. Our fiscal year '24 -- for our fiscal year '24, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion, a total growth rate of 6.1% to 7.8%. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $13.85 to $14.35, a growth rate of 6.6% to 10.5%. Please note the following: fiscal year '24 interest expense is expected to be approximately $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal year '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt. This may change as a result of future share buybacks or acquisition activity. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3% compared to a rate of 20.4% for fiscal '23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. And guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. We're excited about next year and beyond. The future of Cintas remains bright.  I'll turn the call back over to Jared. Good morning, Andrew, thanks for the question. Yes, good question. We're -- from a pricing standpoint, as we have spoken about in past quarters, is our pricing has been certainly above historical during fiscal '23, as it needed to be because of the cost inputs. When we think about what that will look like moving forward in our '24 guide, we expect that pricing will return closer to historical and our cost inputs are in a similar spot, as you saw in the CPI report that came out yesterday and the PPI report that came out this morning. We are seeing inflation coming down. I think our team has done a pretty amazing job of managing input costs, both our operational team but our supply chain team which has really benefited us. So it's -- we do not rely upon pricing as the only lever to gain leverage to expand margin. We are committed to extracting out inefficiencies in our business, and you're seeing that. And you've seen that in fiscal '23. And our guide for fiscal '24 reflects incremental -- attractive incremental margins, and we're going to do it successfully, and we're going to expect that inefficiencies in our business to help us expand margins. Faiza, thank you for the question. We're not guiding towards a significant economic disruption. Trying to predict economic indicators is certainly very challenging. But I can tell you what's going on, what we're seeing in our business, which is we haven't seen much change in our customer behavior.  Our sales productivity is very good. Our customer retention levels remain quite strong. And there is -- there's still really good interest in our products and our services. Know programmers are still going very well. And there's still the majority of the new accounts that we sell. So we like that very much. We like expanding the pie and those customers are seeing value in what we're providing. We also like our vertical strategy that -- the vertical sales strategy that has been working quite nicely for us. So I would say, reasonably so business as usual is what we would expect. We recognize there will be ups and downs in macro environments, but we're not guiding towards anything -- any economic downturn. Certainly. Our relationship with Google gives us a better, faster, smarter, cheaper way to store our critical data. But we see it as it can do so much more, due in large part because of the relationship that Google has with SAP and the relationship we have with SAP and now Google. As you all know, we have had a very successful relationship with SAP for over a decade now. And we've spoken in the past that it is much more than just a customer vendor relationship. It's a strategic relationship.  So you combine that with just a couple of months ago, SAP and Google announced that they have an expanded partnership. And what that's going to do is it's going to allow our SAP data to be connected with the Google Cloud Data and analytics technology, which will give us access to their advanced AI and machine learning capabilities. So we're excited about that. It's going to -- we think we can benefit for many years to come as this type of relationship.  But you asked Faiza for a few examples. So I'll give you a few to help give a little color around it. We see having these technologies connected, the opportunity to put in front of our sales organization instead of calling, I'll say, more blindly on who to try to sell our services to, we call it next best prospect for our sales team to have real technologies to push in front of them. Here's where you go spend your time. We think that's significant and can have an impact on our productivity and our retention and morale productivity, all those things. Next best product for the customer. So instead of just trying to figure that out, we can put that in front of our sales team to -- and our service team to make sure that they're talking to our customers about the next best product that would fit based upon other customer behaviors. We think certain customer service functions could be enhanced nicely over the coming years. There is -- we all use Google Maps, and we see an opportunity to leverage Google Maps to even further enhance our Smart Truck technology to make routing even more dynamic, which will save us time, saves us energy, saves us -- allows for more time in front of our customers instead of on the road. And then just one more, I would say is that, our service team, we're blessed to have a lot of customers. We want to make sure that they're spending -- they're in front of the right customers at the right time. And we see the potential to leverage that type of technology to point them in the right direction to make sure that they're focused on any at-risk customers and customers that we need to enhance the effort with them with the people in front of them. So hopefully, that gives you a little color around it. Again, this is not -- we don't see this as an event, we see this as a process and the coming years, we think it can be very impactful for our business and our customers. Thank you, Ashish. I'll start, and if Mike wants to chime in. The First Aid and Safety business is going quite well. We really like that business. We've -- we see significant opportunities in the future there. And we're getting leverage there, really growth -- the strong growth is really helping us get some real leverage but the mix of business is very attractive. We spoke about during the peaks of the pandemic now, there was more PPE sales and safety sales. And the mix is now back to what we really like, it's a cabinet sale that are repeat in nature and higher margin. So we really like the mix, but the growth in total is great.  And I would tell you that the value proposition is really resonating our customers are trying to make sure that they're reinvesting in their people. Health and wellness is a concept that is resonating very strongly in the marketplace, and we're leveraging that and benefiting from that. And on top of that, we're also -- we have inefficiencies in that business as well. So we're extracting out those inefficiencies. They're going to help us continue to expand our margins. But we like the position we're in, we like the tailwinds we have with the health and wellness, and we think the future is quite bright in that area. Certainly. Our key verticals where we're focusing our time is health care, education and government. We've organized around those verticals. We have products and services that are attractive to them. Certain service functions dedicated to them. And as a result, we're really benefiting from it. And we very much think that they're smart verticals to invest in. And as a result, they're growing really attractively. And customer retention is good, new business is good. And we think that there's a real long opportunity here for us to continue to invest in these into the future. Certainly, the demographics of health care are quite attractive. But education and government are doing well in addition, and we're going to continue to invest in those areas. So it's paying dividends for us. Yes, Manav, you were -- I couldn't hear the first part, but I think I understand your question. I'll try to answer it. And if I don't, then please let me know. The know programmers are -- it's going quite well. And it has historically been a significant portion of what we sell, and it continues to be a significant portion of what we sell. And we have products and services that are attractive to them. We have a sales effort that is, I'd say, skilled at identifying and delivering the message to those folks. And I think it's important to understand that with know programmers, it's not always -- I would say rarely is it just all incremental new spend to them. Many, many cases, we are able to -- they're spending those dollars somewhere in many cases, with other vendors, maybe not a direct competitor, but they're spending money on compliance and image and safety and cleanliness, those types of things. And as a result, we're able to redirect those dollars to us, in many cases, save the money. So don't think of it all as, oh my gosh, is there an end to that because if the economy -- there's any stress in it that they're not going to be able to sell know programmers there, quite the opposite. We're -- we see a very, very long runway there. So that's attractive. As far as the competitive set, I mean, we operate in a very competitive industry, a very competitive environment. I would say I haven't seen any changes to the competitive landscape from that standpoint. So I'll leave it at that. Well, it's certainly going to be a process. We just entered into our relationship with them recently. We've had meetings with them to talk about where we're going to go here. And as I mentioned, it's not an event. It's a process. But we see some low-hanging fruit, I guess is the best way to say it. But as we have gone down this path, more ideas are coming out. So we think we can benefit for years to come with this opportunity. And I won't go into too much detail just because we see some competitive advantages there. And so as a result, we'll keep those to ourselves. But we think the runway is long and attractive. Yes. Josh, it's a good question. It's a mix. Cross-sell has been very helpful for us over the last number of years and will continue to be. But we love new customers. And the Fire and First Aid, there is some overlap, but not complete overlap. And so it allows us to get into speaking to customers about that. And the first time they may have done business with us at all. So -- and then we -- separately we have an enterprise sales organization that will call a customer or prospect.  And frankly, it doesn't really matter to us what they start with. It's whatever the customer is interested in. If a customer doesn't do any business with us and they want to start -- their interest is in Fire, wonderful, or if it's in First Aid, wonderful, or rental garments, then we go where the interest is and then we expand out that relationship from there. So we love the fact that there isn't complete overlap, and it gets us into new opportunities and then we cross-sell like crazy. Thanks for the question, Justin. I'll try to answer and see if Mike wants to expand upon it. So when you think about our growth, Q4 growth was around 10%, which is really nice growth, especially considering a strong comp of last year of 12.7%, which was our strongest growth of the year, that year.  So if you compare that 10% to the -- I'll call it the top end of our guide or in the mid-7s to higher 7s, you can think of that as really pricing returning back to closer to historical levels. And as I mentioned earlier, the reason that we see this as appropriate and is we're seeing an easing of inflation. And we saw that -- you can see that in the drop in the cost of energy that we've seen, the benefit we received in Q4. And as I mentioned earlier, also you saw it in the CPI report yesterday and the PPI report today. So -- and as you appropriately said, I mean, we're guiding towards a more historical type of growth volume growth is really good still. Pricing will return closer to historical appropriately so. But all that being said, we will still have -- we're guiding towards incremental margins and operating margin expansion. So pricing is a lever, but it's not our only lever available to us in order to expand margins. Good morning, George. It's a pretty -- the environment hasn't changed significantly. The health of customers is varies based upon geographic, what type of business they're in, small, medium, large, those types of things. But generally speaking, the sales process and has not elongated the sales pipe looks very good. We like the spot we're in. And we have invested appropriately. We're in the right -- we've got the right products and services.  We've got the right focus on our customers, and we think that we're well positioned for the future. And we certainly are trying to make sure that we're planning for the long term. And we're -- as I mentioned earlier, not trying to be an economic forecasting business, but we are making sure that we're watching our business very closely and hoping for clear sailing ahead with the economy. That being said, we will find a way to be successful as we have in the past. Certainly, George. The healthcare business has been strong for us for a number of years. And is large part not just having a sales focus, but organizing around those customers, products, services, our service organization. So it's more than just sales. It is making sure that we look at it as a business. And it's growing -- it's accretive to our growth rates. We see very long runway there. As I mentioned earlier, the demographics are really attractive. But the pipeline of sales growth looks robust. And that's because of years of investment in making sure we're really well positioned, and we see that continuing. Yes, Tim, we do not expect to give back, we expect to maintain and build on those improvements. And we're leveraging certainly the total growth, the benefits of health and wellness being important to people in the marketplace. The mix of business being attractive and we've fundamentally focused on extracting out inefficiencies in the business. So -- and we're not giving those back. So yes, we see the future is bright for that business. Great question, Tim. So, over the past few years, we've seen a nice improvement to our customer retention levels through the pandemic. We think that we handle that really strategically, intelligently and thought about the long term. And we saw our customer satisfaction scores go up at that same time. And we've continued to see those same levels of customer satisfaction and retention levels.  So no, we have not seen a change from that standpoint. And we're always working on improving our business and making sure that we are super focused on making sure we're taking great care of our customers and staying attentive to their needs, is a big part of what makes us successful. So we've not seen a change, and we're focused on making sure that doesn't happen. Kartik, we have not seen a change to our ad stops metrics, and we are expecting that, that will continue. We're -- part of it is because of the diversity of our customer base, not just good producing services providing and the broadness of our customer base. We're not dependent upon any one particular area and we expect to grow in multiples of GDP. And all that being said, we expect that and stops metrics will continue on its path. Well, Seth, good morning. We like the momentum in all of our businesses. So will there be some above, some below? Yes. But it's -- but generally speaking, we see in the mid-to-high single digits would be probably where you can think of it. And it's -- and as I mentioned earlier, the -- we're up against comps that are significant, partly because of pricing being above historical in the past, well above historical, now it being closer to historical. Good morning, Heather. So yes, our Uniform Rental business is performing quite well. We've -- we think we have invested appropriately in the sales organization. We really like where we're going there. We like the productivity levels. They've continued to go up. And there's plenty of inputs to productivity and it's whether it's products that we launch, services that we launch, the retention levels of our people, the leadership of the organization to make sure that we're driving items that make them more successful.  So no, it's going well, and our service organization is doing an outstanding job with customer retention, making sure, as I mentioned earlier, our customer satisfaction scores are near all-time highs. And as a result of that, our lost business, our customer retention, the appropriate way to say it. Our customer retention is really attractive. So our new is up and our customer retention is improved over pre-COVID levels. So those are big for us and having a really positive impact on the business. Yes, Heather, we're certainly investigating and investing in opportunities. And we think we're with the right partners. When you think about Verizon, SAP and Google, having those three as the -- our technology -- our strategic technology partners, we think we're with the right folks. And we don't just have a customer vendor relationship with them, we have a strategic relationship with them, and they're helping us -- they are and will help us to leverage those opportunities in the marketplace.  So I can't lay out specifics for you, but I'll just tell you this, we're -- we see the opportunity to invest in that area, and we are doing so appropriately because we think it will pay big dividends. That being said, it will be -- we'll be speaking about this for many, many years to come because we think the benefit has a real -- has a lot of legs to it. Scott, let me make sure I understand. You're saying if we can't get to leverage or if the economic environment changes? Yes. Certainly. Good question. I -- we have a very tenured, very experienced leadership team, management team that has been through the cycles. It seems like you name it, we've been through it, and we expect to be successful in all environments. Now -- so your -- the question is a tough one to answer because the economic downturn, how deep is it? How long is it? How broad? And so trying to understand that is challenging. But we expect to be successful in all economic environments.  If you're talking about a massive downturn in '08, '09, that might be different. But we're ready. We know how to do this. We have demonstrated our ability to be successful in and all these different types of economic environments. We have grown our sales and profits in 52 -- in the last 54 years. And my expectation is we will absolutely do so and we will find and fight and a way to be successful in whatever economic environment. So plenty of levers available to us. And we think we've got the right team in place to manage that. Good question, Shlomo. We love it when our customers are hiring more employees and it certainly allows you to swim a little bit downstream then. But we've got to find ways to add value to customers even when they're in the more flattish type environment. That being said, there is still almost 10 million job openings. So that's very encouraging.  We'd love to see those jobs filled. But we are -- we're going to find a way to be successful whether our customers are hiring at rapid rates or at much lower rates, we're going to find a way to be successful. And that is impacted by our ability to -- we would call it cross-sell, bring more value to the customers in other products and services that they may have with maybe a new business unit, but maybe within that business unit just selling more items. So there's a lot of inputs to that and how we categorize it. But we're -- we like the spot that we're in. And we think the products and services and the value proposition that we're providing is resonating with people. And would certainly love the economic to continue or even improve. Thank you, Toni. We -- the answer is yes. All the above is what we're doing. We see a long runway in the First Aid business. We're -- the vast majority of what we sell are people that are do-it-yourself. There's -- as you think about, there's 16 million businesses in North America, there is a significant opportunity to sell our First Aid cabinet services, but our other services as well, whether they be AEDs, wash stations, those types of items that really have value to customers. And that health, safety, compliance tailwind, we don't see that changing.  People are investing in their organizations, and we see that as a tailwind for many years to come and the market is really, really big. So that's where we're -- we love the growth that we're seeing in that business, and we're continuing to invest appropriately to make sure that it continues."

            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal '23 fourth quarter revenue was $2.28 billion compared to $2.07 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 10.3%. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.77 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 9.1%. As we've done in the past, I will share revenue mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, there can be small fluctuations in mix between quarters. Uniform Rental was 48%, dust [ph] was 18%, hygiene was 16%, shop towels were 4%, linen, which includes microfiber wipes, towels and aprons was 10%, and catalog revenue was 4%. These percentages are consistent with last year, which speaks to the robust demand across all of our products and services. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $249.8 million compared to $218.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 14.1%. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $261.5 million compared to $226.2 million last year. The fire business revenue was $173.5 million, and the organic revenue growth rate was 17.3% resulting in a strong finish to the year. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $88 million, and the organic growth rate was 11.5%. This strong performance exceeded our expectations as robust demand continued for these products and services. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.09 billion, compared to $946.2 million last year, an increase of 15.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 45.6% last year, an increase of 210 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 65 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services help generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.7% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 51% for First Aid and Safety Services, 47.9% for Fire Protection Services and 36% for Uniform Direct sale.  Fourth quarter SG&A was 27.1%, which was up 100 basis points from last year. We've continued to invest in selling resources and branding initiatives, and our insurance costs were higher. We are self-insured, which means our insurance costs can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Fourth quarter operating income was $470.8 million compared to $404.4 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 20.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 19.5% in last year's fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.4% compared to 22.8% last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $346.2 million compared to $294.5 million last year. This year's fourth quarter diluted EPS was $3.33 compared to $2.81 last year. I'll now turn the call back over to Todd to provide his thoughts and our financial expectations for fiscal '24. Thank you, Andrew, I might just add two things. One, specifically, we do not have a fuel surcharge. And secondly, you made a comment about our price increases offsetting input costs and I think the best -- the way to think about that is margins in the fourth quarter were up 110 basis points. Margin for the fiscal '23 year were up 70 basis points and our guidance implies margin improvement throughout the range of guidance for next year. So, keep that in mind as we think about pricing versus input costs, et cetera, we're still raising margins, improving margins. Josh, our incremental margin for the total company in fiscal '23 was 26.8%, a little bit up from the previous year. And Josh, it's -- there can be ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter in the way that we invest or in the cost that we see. And so we don't necessarily try to predict one quarter at a time. We do certainly believe we can get incremental operating margins in that 20% to 30% range from quarter-to-quarter generally, but it's going to go up and down, again, based on what we are doing within the business, some initiatives that we may or may not roll out. So the bigger focus for us is on the full year, and our goal is to get those incremental attractive enough that it improves margins over the year. So I wouldn't call it linear at all, I wouldn't call it flat. It's going to be based on how we're managing the business. Justin, because we are self-insured, those claims can -- they can kind of move up and down throughout the year. There's nothing that we would say is structural related to that. It's just a product of being self-insured. We ended the year at 26.9% in SG&A, that is, gosh, a couple of 100 basis points maybe lower than pre-COVID in the last few years, and you've heard us speak about this.  Look, we've worked hard to get it to that level, and we don't want to get back to historical levels. So our expectation is we're going to continue to find ways to better leverage SG&A, particularly G&A to make sure that it contributes to our margin expansion into the future. So we're going to continue to work hard to look for opportunities to bring it down and do not expect it to return to those higher 20 places that we were in pre-COVID. I don't have that in front of us, George, right now. In the past, it's been about 7%. And it's -- I'd say that it's growing faster than average. Yeah. Tim, we talk a lot about the mix certainly returning, and that's being -- that's a big part of it. But as Todd mentioned, our first aid safety partners have a lot of things going on in terms of business improvement opportunities from sourcing better, to routing better, to sales productivity improving, to penetration opportunities. There's a lot going on in that business.  And we've attributed a lot, you're correct, to the revenue mix, and that has been important in terms of the height of the pandemic to today. But there's also a lot that's going on in the business that is working towards structural improvements in the business that create long-term efficiencies and you're seeing that. And that's why we don't expect to give it back. There's nothing that we are underspending or underinvesting in to get these margins. These are real business improvements that are sustainable. And that's what we love about the business. It has been growing nicely, it's resonating with our prospects and customers. And it's pretty exciting to think about that business in our fiscal '24 topping $1 billion for the first time. So we do love the business, and there's a lot of good work going on there. So let me -- I'll give you a couple of numbers. Fourth quarter total energy for the total company was 1.8% for the fourth quarter. For the year, that was 2.2%. So for the year -- this year -- fiscal '23 compared to '22, it was down 10 basis points. So it's roughly flattish. As we think about '24, look, the prices at the pump spiked in June of last year. And so our first quarter numbers of last year were fairly high. And so we may get a little bit of a tailwind in Q1 and then our expectation is we'll turn roughly flattish. Sure. Yes, we would expect 3.5% to 4% of revenue. Look, when we've had a really good couple of years of volume growth, we have capacity needs in certain places. Capacity is local in our business, but we have capacity needs. And we want to continue to invest for growth. And so there will be everything from added washers and dryers and specific wash alleys to some of a few bricks and mortar new buildings and other investments in the business that allow us to continue to have the capacity we need to grow. So it is kind of back to that historical 3.5% to 4% range. That would be our expectation. Sure. From a capital allocation, I'll start with our expectation is that cash flow is going to continue to be very good in fiscal '24. And secondly, our balance sheet is in great shape. We -- as of May 31, we have no variable debt. And so we can do a lot of things with great cash flow and a great balance sheet. We would love to use that on M&A if the opportunities come along, and we'll be as aggressive as we can be in terms of looking for them and making sure that they come at the right value, but we love that opportunity. Buyback is another great opportunity, again, with good cash flow and a great balance sheet, we can put that cash to work, and we certainly could do it in the form of a buyback. So, look, our capital allocation philosophy and strategy hasn't changed. And with -- again, with a healthy balance sheet and a healthy cash flow, we can do some good things with that as we look forward to fiscal '24. Your second question of the one workday for a fiscal year. In this case, it would be about a 40 basis point benefit to growth -- sales growth. And think about it as about a 12 basis point benefit on bottom line on operating margin. Sure, Shlomo. Look, the First Aid margin was at 18.8% in Q4, still a really healthy place to be. And nothing noteworthy other than growth is -- organic growth still is very good, gross margin is still very good, and we continue to invest for the future. So nothing noteworthy there. From the all other perspective, the Fire operating margin in Q4 was slightly over 20 and so that's a great place for us in that business. The direct sale business was 3.5%. So quite a bit lower. And that business can move up and down and have a little bit more volatility than the other businesses just because of the nature of it. We still love the business. It grew nicely, but mix can have an outsized effect on that operating margin and it sort of did in the fourth quarter. As we move forward, from a First Aid perspective, we still expect the really positive margins that we've seen as we've discussed a few minutes ago. And we still expect Fire to continue to perform very, very well like it has in fiscal '23. Toni, that's a really difficult thing to try to say one point of inflation equals x points of margin. That's pretty difficult to do. But I'd maybe say this. When you think about our cost structure, we've got a really nice mix of cost types, if you will. So we certainly have things like labor that are impacted by inflationary pressures. And we work very, very hard on that over the course of the last five years, I would say. And we're in a good spot. But then we also have this large part of our cost structure that is amortizing. And it allows us to effectively see any inflationary impacts coming if they are coming and plan for them accordingly. And so we may plan for that in terms of our pricing approach, we may plan for that in terms of other initiatives. But the point is, because we're amortizing those costs, it takes a while for inflation to get to us, and during that period of time, we can plan and we can anticipate better. While we're on that bucket, I would say our global supply chain really does a nice job of not being single sourced. And so when there are some inflationary pressures in various parts of the world or in our supply chain, because we're not single source, we have the ability to move volume a little bit in flex, we have choices. And that's important for us. And it has been important for us over the course of the last two years in the high inflationary environment. And then the third bucket that I would throw out is sort of that infrastructure. We've got a large infrastructure, 400-plus locations around the country. And when we are growing really nicely, we're leveraging it very, very well, and we've done that over the course of the last few years. And so Toni, we're not a product company that is dramatically affected by today's inflation. And you hear us talk about pricing is just one lever that we have to get margin improvement.  And that's because of, number one, we've got this sort of diverse cost structure. And number two, we've got a lot of initiatives and things that we're working on. And it gives us choices. And that's the -- that's really the key for us in terms of fighting inflation. So hopefully, that answers the question. It's not an easy metric for us because of the cost structure that we have and the initiatives that we have, and it also depends on where the inflation comes from."

Schneider: Thank you, Paul. Third quarter total revenue grew 11.7% to $2.19 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. The benefit of our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding a gain in the related tax benefit in last year's third quarter, operating income margin increased 110 basis points to 20.4% and diluted EPS grew 16.7% to $3.14. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other.  The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $1.72 billion compared to $1.55 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 10.8%. While price increases contributed at a higher level than historically, revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance.  Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter was $231.6 million compared to $213 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 7.8%. The segment was up against a difficult revenue comparison because last year's third quarter revenue included about $15 million in sales of COVID-19 test kits that did not repeat this year. Excluding the prior year test kit sales, the organic revenue growth rate was 16%. We continue to have good momentum in our First Aid Cabinet business, which continues to grow greater than 20%.  Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the all other segment. All other revenue was $242.2 million compared to $194.3 million last year. The fire business revenue was 105 -- $155.8 million and the organic revenue growth rate was 20.7%. Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $86.5 million and the organic growth rate was 32%.  Now before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.67 billion to $8.75 billion to a range of $8.74 billion to $8.80 billion. The total growth rate of 11.3% to 12%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $12.50 to $12.80 to a range of $12.70 to $12.90, a growth rate of 12.6% to 14.4%. Mike?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 third quarter revenue was $2.19 billion compared to $1.96 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 11.8%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $1 billion compared to $898.2 million last year, an increase of 15.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 45.8% last year, an increase of 140 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 15 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 51.6% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.5% for Fire Protection Services and 35.8% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $446.8 million compared to $407.6 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 20.8% in last year's third quarter. Fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income included a $30.2 million gain on an equity method investment transaction. The gain was recorded in selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this gain, fiscal 2023 third quarter operating income as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% compared to 19.3% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 110 basis points.  Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.1% compared to 18.2% last year. The fiscal 2022 third quarter equity method investment transaction included a significant tax benefit. Excluding the transaction, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 19.6%. Net income for the third quarter was $325.8 million compared to $315.4 million last year. This year's third quarter diluted EPS of $3.14 compared to $2.97 last year. However, fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS contained $0.28 from the gain on the equity method investment transaction, which included a related $0.07 tax rate benefit. Excluding this gain and the related benefit -- the related tax benefit, fiscal 2023 third quarter diluted EPS of $3.14 compared to $2.69 in last year's third quarter, an increase of 16.7%. Cash flow remains strong. On December 15, 2022 we paid shareholders $117.4 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 18.6% from the amount paid the previous December.  Todd provided our annual financial guidance related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal 2022 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and again on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal 2022 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal 2023 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.77 billion to $1.80 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains. Fiscal 2023 interest expense is expected to be $112 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal 2022 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.7%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes significant economic disruptions or downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul. \nPaul F. Adler: And that concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav. \nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping you could talk about -- clearly, you had strong results in the quarter, so I assume all the trends that you're hearing from your customers were solid but have you seen any changes more recently with all the events that have occurred out there in the banking world and if that's impacting kind of the small business confidence where you guys have more kind of exposure to?\nTodd M. Schneider: Good morning Manav. Thanks for the question. It is -- we're watching it very closely. Certainly, there's rumblings when you read the newspapers every day and what's going on in the marketplace, but our customers seem still quite solid. And it's always a very competitive marketplace, and we're competing quite well there. They like our products and services, and we help them run their business better. So -- and help free them up to take care of items to where they can focus on their business. So we like our value proposition and -- but we certainly prefer an environment where our customers are in a great strong economy. But we're not seeing it just yet. And -- but we're certainly watching it very closely and monitoring it and making sure that we're focused on providing great value for our customers.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, the growth has obviously been pretty strong, better than I think what we were expecting to, but you said most of that growth was mostly volume. And so I was just wondering on the volume piece, is it that you're taking maybe more share than normal? Or is it just that these businesses are starting to get back to more normal capacity, and so there's more of that volume recovery that's aiding that?\nTodd M. Schneider: Yes, it's a good question. There's a whole lot of inputs to our success in growing our revenue at the levels that we're growing at, and it is exceeding our expectations. Certainly, new business is quite good. We really like that. Our retention levels are very attractive. Cross-sell that we've spoken about in the past is continuing to improve. And as we mentioned, pricing is above historical, but the volumes are really coming from the three areas that I mentioned. Keep in mind, the majority of the new accounts that we sell are new to our segment, meaning we call them new programmers, so we're growing the pie, not taking -- just taking share. We certainly love to do both, but growing the pie has been something that we are quite good at and have done consistently over the years, and we still -- we think the future is quite bright there.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew. \nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. Without just one quarter left in the fiscal year, I just wanted to ask what the organic revenue growth year-over-year for the fourth quarter 2023 is implied in the upgraded fiscal 2023 guide?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Andrew, the fourth quarter guide would contemplate 6.5% to 9.5% revenue growth. But keep in mind, we've talked a lot about the direct sale business, which grew 32% in the third quarter, and it is coming up against tougher comps. And so we just don't see that kind of growth continuing and settling back into what we would say is a typical growth rate for direct sale in that low single digits. So that's the primary change that we see in the fourth quarter.\nAndrew Steinerman: Right. And so for the rental business, you're expecting a similar growth rate in the fourth quarter than you had in the third?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Well, I'll say this, Todd, just talked about the -- we haven't seen much change in customer behavior and the demand has still been really good and the momentum in the rental business is good. And while I'm not ready to say we're guiding to a specific number, we don't see much change to it coming into the fourth quarter. Momentum still is strong.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Faiza. \nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, good morning. I was hoping to talk a little bit about -- you've historically seen your results have accelerated beyond what the [Technical Difficulty] would suggest, and you've talked about new verticals and the benefits at the implementation. So curious, how much more run rate do you see in both of those areas as we look ahead to next fiscal year and potentially [Technical Difficulty]?\nTodd M. Schneider: Faiza, I'll start, and then Mike can certainly chime in. As far as our results are quite good, we usually do grow in multiples of GDP. And -- but we like where we are and where we're heading. Regarding SAP, we're very much in the early innings of SAP. That is the umbrella of our technology investment or the digitization of our business. And we went through all the implementation, which we're still -- there's always work to be done there. But nevertheless, we're seeing benefits from our technology investments. Our customers are seeing benefits from our technology investments. And we certainly love when we derive efficiencies from technology, but we get even more excited when our customers see benefits, giving us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. So we've talked in the past about the certain advantages that we get with technology investments. My Cintas portal is one of the more obvious ones that the customers see an advantage. They get to be able to manage their account. They make request the majority of our requests are done outside of normal business hours. So our customers don't always just want to be able to deal with our service provider in person or call our office during normal business hours. So they like to be able to do the flexibility to do business on their time and to get things off their list and move it on to ours. And that portal allows that flexibility for them and it's showing up in customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. So yes, very much on the early innings of our technology deployment, I can certainly speak more to that, if you like.\nJ. Michael Hansen: Before you get into that, Todd, I just might remind -- provide a reminder that, look, we love the market opportunity also for our business. And it's -- we look at it as a very, very big opportunity. So in other words, when we talk about we have a little bit over 1 million customers, there are 16 million customers or 16 million businesses in the U.S. and Canada, we're just continuing to try to highlight that there is a great market opportunity, and Todd brought up the point that when the majority of our new business is expanding the served market or tapping into that large market potential, it means that we can grow in those multiples of GDP and employment growth for a long period of time. I think it's important to keep that in mind as you think about the growth potential over the longer term, that market opportunity is great.\nFaiza Alwy: Great, that's really helpful. Maybe on the -- I mean, I would love to hear more about the technology so I'll leave it up to you in terms of how much more you'd like to share. But maybe specifically on the healthcare vertical, could you talk about what the growth trends have been like there, what they were like this particular quarter and sort of how they've been trending?\nTodd M. Schneider: Certainly, the healthcare business is a great vertical for us. We have spent years organizing appropriately around that with our service providers, our sales partners, and we've organized around products and services that they find attractive. And so a good example of that is -- let me back up, so our growth rates are very attractive there. They're in excess of where we're running in totality and they're primarily due to what I just described, but also some specific products that we have launched. And we've spoken a little bit about the scrub business. When the scrub business historically was not a real attractive business for us and the reason being it was low-quality products, heavy low margin, and just they were kind of not treated as a disposable, but pretty close to a disposable product. And we changed the game on that when we launched our garment dispensing service there, which controls the inventory levels for our customers. And here's the big thing is it what it -- because the technology controls it and only allows what the administrator of the hospital says each person can get, then what allows us to do is to provide a higher quality product but not be dealing with such low cost, low margin products. The customer is happier, we control the cost so much better because the inventory is controlled. So that's a great example of one of the innovations that we brought to the healthcare industry. That certainly is a technology that people value, and it's helping us grow that business really attractively. And we're still very much in the early innings of that. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead George.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks, good morning. I wanted to dive a little bit more into the selling environment. Can you discuss what you're seeing with client sales cycles, budgets, and client headcount and what the implications are for the business?\nTodd M. Schneider: Yes, thanks for the question George. I would say that the selling environment is very similar. It has not really changed much. Sales cycles, they're not elongating the -- what's going on with our customers, they're still fighting to bring people on to make sure that they're providing the right levels of service. And in these types of environments, we help provide value to them. We provide a benefit to them running their business. And in many cases, we're able to help customers save money from what they were doing. So I spoke earlier about when you walk into a customer and they're not a programmer, well they still have products that -- probably that they have procured on their own kind of a do-it-yourself and they're struggling to keep up with that. And in many cases, because of our scale and our ability to source products and the fact that we are already there, servicing them in many cases, we can provide great value for them and actually help lower their costs. So -- and we've seen that throughout the years, and that's a real benefit as we go through trying to provide value for our customers. So, generally speaking, George, I would say the selling environment is pretty similar -- not a whole lot of change over the past six months or so.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, you increased your full year guidance pretty much across the board. How much of that increase was driven by fiscal 3Q outperformance versus your internal expectations compared to a stronger fiscal 4Q outlook?\nJ. Michael Hansen: George, I don't know if I can specifically separate the guidance raise. But clearly, we had a nice third quarter and the performance was strong from the organic growth to the gross margins to the operating margin. So a pretty solid quarter all the way through. And our guide for Q4 would suggest we expect more of the same. So the guide would suggest we expect another nice quarter. Hard to separate though for us exactly what the difference is because our internal expectations are a little bit different than our external, I'll say, consensus and guide.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead Stephanie. \nHans Hoffman: Hi, this is Hans Hoffman on for Stephanie. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on margins, specifically the First Aid and Safety gross margin. Obviously, really strong and almost 52%. Is that just a function of kind of lower margin PPE sales rolling off and higher-margin cabinets business kind of becoming a larger part of the mix or is there anything else kind of to call out on the performance there and how should we be thinking about margins in that business on a go-forward basis?\nTodd M. Schneider: Yes, Hans, it's a good question and good morning. Certainly, we're very happy with the trends that we're seeing in the gross margin in the First Aid business, but we're very happy in general with the First Aid business. It is -- execution is at a very high level. Certainly, the mix of business is we're benefiting from since PPE sales and safety sales tend to be lower margin, but there is strong demand for what we are providing. Health and Wellness is resonating in the marketplace. The mantra that we have in that business is what's more important to a business than the health and safety of their people. So -- and that is resonating. And so we're getting good leverage from the growth and the mix, but strong execution and we really like how we're operating in that business.\nHans Hoffman: Got it, thanks. And then just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on the -- all other segment. Clearly, really strong growth there in the quarter. And I know last quarter, you guys kind of talked about tougher comps, specifically in the Uniform Direct business in the second half of this year. I was just kind of curious what kind of drove the strong performance this quarter, as I think a lot of us kind of expected that to kind of show up in Q3?\nTodd M. Schneider: Yes. It's -- certainly, the comps in Q4 are quite challenging and as Mike mentioned, we do expect that to moderate. The Uniform Direct Sale business is a little lumpier and sometimes, things come through based upon customer demand a little faster or what have you. But certainly, the comps in Q4 are tougher, and that's part of our guide.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead Andrew. \nAndrew Wittmann: Yes, great, thanks. And good morning everyone. I guess I was hoping, Mike, you could talk a little bit about some of the relevant inflationary factors that are driving so much, the stress in the overall economy. But specific to your business, I was wondering if you could talk about the -- basically the COGS or merchandise costs, whether it's for uniforms, mats or the ancillary services that you provide as well as address how labor is progressing in your business, have those things generally been -- have you been able to get leverage on those items despite the challenges, in other words, are those down as a percentage of revenue in the quarter, can you just talk about the trend lines that you're seeing in those if there's any moderation or acceleration in them?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Sure. So I'll start with material cost, Andrew. Let me start with we source or direct the sourcing of more than 90% of our volume and more than 90% of our items have more than one source. And that's really important to keep in mind so that when our vendors may have inflationary pressures on them, the thing to remember is we have choices. And so sometimes that means we do have to take increases, but many times, it means we have -- we can flex and we can negotiate and we can -- again, we have choices. And so we don't always have to accept every vendor price increase that comes our way when we direct to sourcing ourselves and when we have multiple sources, that's really important. The other thing is, obviously, the amortization of this bucket of expenses allows us to see ahead, to anticipate what's coming.  So as you can imagine, when a vendor does come to us and has a price increase, that -- it takes a while to, first of all, build the inventory and then it goes to our distribution centers. And then for after a turn, it comes into our rental locations, and that's where the amortization starts. And in month one, we have 1/18th of that inflation for garments, for example, 1/48th of that for entrance mats. And so you can kind of get a feel for it. It takes a long time for those inflationary pressures to come to us. That means we can do lots of planning. We can think about initiatives that we have going on, and we can accelerate some of those. We can think about process improvement and we can implement those, but we can also give in at least one annual price increase and maybe multiple price increases before that full inflation hits us. So we can really get ahead of that kind of cost. So we have choices, and we can really see ahead of that. And that gives us a really nice opportunity to plan the business without a lot of disruption.  The other thing I'll say, Andrew, is we've got a lot of infrastructure. We've got a lot of facilities and trucks and things, rents. And those aren't quite as disrupted by inflation or at least immediately. And so again, we can get with our great growth, we can get some really nice leverage on that part of our cost structure. And then when you think about labor that you touched on, Andrew, we certainly want to make sure that we are maintaining the absolute best partner engagement that we can, and that means we like to be at market or slightly above market rates, that's important for us in terms of the labor rates. But we've talked about -- we've had a couple of things happen over the course of the last five or six years. One is, we had a lot of gene case synergies being realized over the course of the last six years, and that allowed us to be a little bit more aggressive on raising rates. So we were never caught flat footed in terms of when the labor challenges hit. That was -- that's been important to us, and it's been -- it has allowed us to kind of keep disruption down.  But the other thing is, we've talked a lot about initiatives like Smart Truck. We talked a lot about the technology impacts in our facilities that allow us to be more efficient. So that means as we are growing, we don't need to add as many resources within the plants or on the routes, and that allows us to leverage that labor environment even in this period of time where we've got raising labor rates.\nTodd M. Schneider: Mike, if I can add, Andrew, certainly, in this type of inflationary environment, it's challenging to grow gross margin. We've been quite successful in doing so. Getting good leverage on that revenue has been key for us. But managing our variable costs, it's -- that is just simply part of our culture, managing it very, very closely. So that's been big. But to Mike's point, in leveraging some of our digital transformation, Smart Truck has been very important to us. And then also the -- managing our inventory at our used stock rooms has been really important. And we have good systems in place there that allows us to get better reuse, which is better for the customer because the speed at which we can provide products goes up because it's right there available locally, don't have to get it from a distribution center and ship it into us. And it also, obviously, helps the amortization schedule when you can get better reuse of that current product that you're already paying for. So, the leverage that we're getting as a result of the systems and processes we put in place with technology have -- are paying off.\nAndrew Wittmann: Great, that's helpful. I guess just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about, I guess, the balance sheet, Mike. I mean by -- in the next quarter or two, you'll be at about one times leverage, which is on the lower end of where you've historically run the company. And with the company doing effectively $2.2 billion of EBITDA and growing, there's a cash flow being very strong, you're going to have not only the ability to leverage the balance sheet plus the cash coming in, that's a lot of capital to deploy. How do you deploy that capital in a world where we haven't seen that amount of capital being -- having been deployed really since you guys did G&K, like you said six years ago, how do you keep the balance sheet geared appropriately and what are the opportunities that are out there for you?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Well, the first thing that I'll say is the most important thing for us is to make sure that we're investing in the right way for a long-term success of the business. And so we want to make sure that we are growing capacity as needed with our growth, that we're training our partners, that we're doing the things that we need to do to continue to grow long term. We are still -- we still want to be very acquisitive. It's hard to pinpoint when those may or may not happen, but we want to continue to be acquisitive. We talked about the dividend a little bit and that we've raised it almost 20% this past year. And certainly, while we didn't do any buybacks in the last quarter, that remains an opportunity for us as we look forward. Andy, we want to make sure that we are prudent in the way that we invest our cash. And so sometimes that means we may take a little bit longer to deploy cash but we want to make sure more than anything. Job number one is, long-term growth of the business, both on the top line and on the bottom line and are we doing the right things in order to make that happen and then prudently look for ways to enhance that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead Tim. \nSamuel Kusswurm: Hey, this is Sam Kusswurm on for Tim. Thanks for taking my questions here. I guess to start on the margin side, lower energy costs were 15 basis point benefit during the quarter. I'd imagine this dynamic is going to continue for the next few quarters. I was wondering if you could help frame for us the pacing and size of any benefit you're expecting, if you have any color to provide there?\nTodd M. Schneider: Well, certainly Sam, we watch the energy prices very closely. Fuel, as in diesel and gasoline, hasn't changed that much year over prior. Natural gas, we're watching, and we expect that, that will be a benefit in the near future and the electricity it doesn't change a whole lot. So I wouldn't say that you can count on significant tailwind there. We are certainly not when you think about energy as a percent of sales, I think we came in at 2.15% energy as a percent of sales. So we like when they're coming down, and we manage it as they're going up, but I wouldn't expect a real change there.\nJ. Michael Hansen: Yes, just to frame it a little bit, Sam. Last year in the fourth quarter, our total energy was 2.5% of revenue. In the first quarter, it was 2.4%. This time, it was 2.15%. So we may see a little bit of a benefit in Q4 and Q1. But boy, we've worked so hard to get this to be such a small part of our cost structure that I'm not sure the benefit is going to be that significant one way or the other.\nSamuel Kusswurm: Got you. I appreciate the color there. I guess for a follow-up, you've spoken before about Smart Truck and I think you just mentioned the question previously for the riding software. Now it's been over a year since kind of for filling it out. I guess I'd be curious if you could help quantify a benefit to your margins and if you still think there is a sizable benefit remaining there from further durations or adoption?\nTodd M. Schneider: Yes. Good question, Sam. Yes, we absolutely see opportunities still to come with Smart Truck. It's -- one of the things that we are very careful about is it's -- when you route a new customer, that's one thing. But when you are rerouting your existing customer base, we're very judicious about that because changing the face of the service provider can sometimes bring issues, meaning they love their service provider and now you change it. So you got to be really careful with that. So you're going to see -- I would expect benefits in that area for years to come. And that shows up in energy, in emissions, but it shows up also in productivity because our partners have more time to spend with the customers and they can provide more value to the customers. And as one of the things we talk often about here is, we don't generate any revenue when the wheels are moving. It's only when the wheels stop. So we're very focused on that, but you're going to see it, I think, for years to come.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead Seth. \nSeth Weber: Hey guys, good morning. Hey Mike, I just wanted to ask about free cash flow. It was a little bit below what we were looking for in the quarter. Is that -- do you feel like just a transitory function of revenue growth ramping a little bit better, and you're just kind of getting a little bit behind on working capital or can you just talk us through how you're thinking about working capital going forward? Thanks. \nJ. Michael Hansen: Well, I'll say free cash flow, I think your point is a good one from the perspective of -- it's a little bit transitory, but in the way of, look, we're coming off of a fiscal 2021 year where there wasn't a lot of growth and then really getting some nice acceleration into fiscal 2022 and 2023. And so there is a little bit of -- as we have used capacity through the pandemic, we've gotten back into a time period where we need some capacity here and there. And we've been really good at managing the capacity in many different ways, whether it is, for example, better efficiency in our existing wash alleys to adding a washer to adding a dryer to maybe then adding a new facility. But we've gotten to the point where it's time to add capacity again, and that's healthy. But I would call that there is a little bit of a mismatch there that we're catching up a bit from that. Having said that, look, we still expect free cash flow to be very, very strong. And whenever we're growing nicely, we're going to use some working capital. That's just the nature of our business. And that's a good thing. But you're right, there's a little bit of a catch-up in our capital expenditures, and we'll start to I'll say, those will get more in sync as we go into the next year and following years, assuming there's no other economic disruption.\nSeth Weber: Okay, that's helpful. And so do you think CAPEX could go back to that 4% of revenue range where you kind of work towards the end of the last decade or -- and then it went to like 2% a couple of years ago, I'm just trying to understand where...?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Yes, it's going to be close -- we certainly don't expect it to be down at that 2% level. It's going to be closer to that 4% level as we think about moving forward.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead Heather. \nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you. You talked a fair amount during the call about your success with new customers and that a lot of them are what you call non-programmers. And I think a key theme that's been discussed on multiple calls is the shift to outsourcing and an acceleration kind of in that trend. I'm just curious, as you kind of look to what happened in the third quarter and as you're looking out, kind of your thoughts on how that trend continues, do you see it normalizing, or do you think there's further momentum into the next few years? Thanks.\nTodd M. Schneider: Yes, good morning Heather. I'd say that trend continues. There's still people, our customers still are -- there's still 10 million job openings, folks trying to attract talent and trying to run their business and provide the levels of service that their customers expect. And when we have the ability to outsource items for them at very competitive rates, and again, in many cases, because we're already there, then that makes it quite attractive. And it's one of these like, oh my gosh, you can take this off my plate, then please, take it off my plate. And we leverage that and we'll continue to leverage that. So economic cycle aside, customers still need to take care of their customers and we can help them do exactly that. So we'll be focused on providing that value and managing our cost structure so that we can do it at very competitive rates.\nHeather Balsky: Great, thank you. And I guess as my follow-up, you discussed earlier that you are looking for M&A opportunities, although you don't know kind of when those might occur. I'm curious, can you talk about your priorities with regards to M&A, are there white space areas you want to fill in, is it geographic opportunities, just what are your priorities? Thanks. \nTodd M. Schneider: Yes, good question, Heather. So we're interested in M&A, certainly in our rental business, in our First Aid business and our Fire business. And we make acquisitions every year, every quarter, it seems in each of those businesses. But they're usually reasonably small. Some of them are geographic expansion, some of them are tuck-in. So it's a real mixture. And M&A tends to ebb and flow a bit. It's tough to predict timing, but we're interested in M&A in all those businesses. They have to be the right businesses, meaning well-run businesses, but large, medium, small, we are interested in all and each of those businesses.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead Toni. \nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Wanted to ask about your staffing right now, are you being more cautious now because of the environment or not because I know you mentioned you haven't really seen a slowdown yet in your customer base. So maybe nothing has really changed, so I just wanted to think about how you're thinking of staffing going forward?\nTodd M. Schneider: Yes, Toni, [Technical Difficulty] today. The labor market in general is easier than it was six months ago. It's certainly not easy still. And so we're focused on staffing at the level to make sure that we provide really good customer service. And so that's where we are. We will adjust accordingly if the economic cycle changes. And we're watching it really closely, as you can imagine, to make sure that we're providing the right service, the right value to our customers. But we certainly have a watchful eye out to understand if demand starts to change based upon what's going on in the broader economy.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. And I wanted to ask about pricing. You mentioned a couple of times on the call that price contributed more this quarter versus in the past. And so is that -- I just wanted to understand, is this a function of you had been raising prices a lot and now you are sort of at -- and you're still raising or like is the rate of change on pricing still higher versus before or it's just the prior price increases still coming in? Thanks. \nTodd M. Schneider: Yes, Toni. So our pricing, it varies based upon -- pricing is a local subject. So we handle it differently in different businesses and different geographies. So that being said, yes, our pricing is above what it has been historically. That being said, the volume growth is the majority of our growth. And the reason being is the inflationary environment is such that we have to pass on a larger price increase than we do historically. Fortunately, the customers are -- they understand that. They understand the environment, and we've been very successful in providing the right levels of service so that they are open to those adjustments. We're not here to give guidance beyond Q4 but certainly, if the work of the Fed is such that it brings inflation down, then we'll manage our business accordingly to match that.\nJ. Michael Hansen: Toni, I might just add that the pricing that Todd talked about earlier is relative to historical levels, not -- we were not pointing out that there is a sequential increase in that level of pricing. So if that's where your question might have been coming from, it's really that relative to the historical levels of pricing. We're certainly above that, but not a real change in practice sequentially.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead Shlomo. \nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you very much. I want to ask back on kind of the questions Manav was asking about initially. Just in terms of the client base that you have, it's interesting like the ADP National Employment Report is talking about small businesses have been shedding jobs basically since August. Are you not seeing that at all in your client base or is it that you just skew more towards midsized and larger clients, I just want to get a little bit further into how to read some of the kind of economic reports versus the very strong results that we're seeing at Cintas?\nTodd M. Schneider: Yeah, thank you Shlomo for the question. We have a really diverse customer base. And so no, we are not more geared towards the medium-sized -- small, medium, large customers, geographic, different verticals. We have a really diverse customer base. And when you think about our business now, it is more geared towards the service economy than it is just goods producing. And so you name it, we've got it. We've got some small customers that are struggling. We've got some that are thriving. And that is really more dependent upon their business, there maybe -- their particular environment. And the same goes for the medium and the larger customers. It's a real mix and we work with them. So we have a customer who is particularly struggling, then we pivot and try to adjust accordingly. If their demand is such that it's coming down, then we pivot and handle it accordingly. But again, we also have other products and services that they might be procuring elsewhere where we might help them and provide cost savings to them. So, it varies based upon the customer but we are focused on providing that value and we will continue to focus on that. \nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, great and then just following up on Toni\u2019s question on the pricing, is there any change at all in customer behavior in terms of the continued pricing, is there any more pushback or its kind of the same that you have had over the last say two to three quarters?\nJ. Michael Hansen: Yeah, well there is always pushback from customers, always have and always will be. The current environment with inflation levels make it an opportunity for us to do so better than historical, larger than historical. But I wouldn\u2019t tell you that the environment has changed dramatically. But certainly inflation is starting to, it appears to come down and so we are managing our business accordingly and we will manage our customers accordingly as well. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead Scott. \nScott Schneeberger: Thanks, good morning everyone. I guess, on -- the focus on margin question, could you provide a little bit of attribution, a 110 basis points just operating income improvement year-over-year is really impressive, could you kind of provide what was that via the topline as opposed to where were you getting efficiencies on the cost lines, and maybe elaboration to the extent you are able of what was Smart Truck, what was just automation in the facilities, what was SAP, really, that's where the question is focused on the cost lines, where are you getting the most benefit presently? Thanks. \nJ. Michael Hansen: Well Scott, look, it starts with great growth. And when we are growing our top line at healthy levels, we're going to get some nice leverage. I talked a little bit about in a previous response, I talked a little bit about that the cost structure of having some costs that are a little bit in that infrastructure type of a bucket that when we grow real nicely, we get some great leverage. And that happened in all of our businesses. The growth that we saw in the third quarter was broad-based in all four of our businesses, and that leads to some really nice leveraging in each of those businesses. I talked a little bit about that amortizing aspect of material costs, particularly within the rental business, and again that allows us to see things coming, and it allows us to plan accordingly. And so again, the growth helps in that area, but it also allows us to think about things like process improvements, Smart Truck that you mentioned. And in all of our businesses, we've got those kinds of initiatives. And all of them are -- we're hard at work in all of them. And so we're seeing benefits from process improvement. Some are just simply better improvements, better training, and some are technology related, like the Smart Truck. We've got all of them in each of the businesses, and that is adding to it.  Now certainly, the First Aid margin moving from 12.4% last year to 20.4% this year, there is the mix benefit that we're certainly getting in that space. But we also have lots of other good things going on in there. We are sourcing better in First Aid and Safety. And we do have some really nice process improvement opportunities going on there, and we've initiated Smart Truck in the First Aid and Safety business and in the Fire business. So certainly, First Aid has been a big part of that margin improvement, but we've seen it all. So it's hard -- I don't have specific numbers to give you, Scott, but it starts with great growth and leverage and then we get into better sourcing, process improvement, technology gains, and certainly then healthy mix. All of those things have contributed.\nTodd M. Schneider: Scott, I'd just like to add, certainly what Mike was talking about, it starts with great growth. That is so critical to us. But part of our culture here is we're focused on extracting inefficiencies out of our business. And we've -- and I spoke earlier that there's a lot of inputs to revenue growth, and there's a lot of inputs to margin improvement. And Mike went through a list, which was pretty darn comprehensive. But generally speaking, the -- I'll just say that we're focused on and we're not going to just grow through pricing, and we're going to find a way in these types of environments to extract the inefficiencies so that we can grow margins, which in these type of inflationary environments are certainly is very challenging, but the team is doing a heck of a job, and we're quite proud of it.\nScott Schneeberger: Sounds good, I appreciate the overview. Sounds like a lot of good momentum. You all touched upon My Cintas portal earlier. It sounded like maybe a little bit more you're willing to share. Just curious what percent penetration do you have there, where do you anticipate that to go? And you mentioned that gets used at all hours of the day, but I'm just wondering what inning are we in, and any quantification of benefit of if customers are using that, how much more is that efficient in financially if there's anything you can share on that? Thanks. \nTodd M. Schneider: Yes. Certainly, Scott. It is -- you're talking about changing behavior within customers. So it tends to be a higher percentage of new customers that are coming on board that are participating at a high level. And the reason being is, it's new behavior, period. So then changing the customer -- the current customer behavior takes longer. And because they're used to a certain way of how we're doing business and some are leaning into it faster than others. But we're -- we see a very long runway here of benefits that we're going to get. And where does it show up? It shows up in so many places, but certainly trying to be easier to do business with is a focus here, and it makes it easier to do business with us. So I think you'll see that benefit for years to come.\nJ. Michael Hansen: It's a little bit of an evolution with My Cintas in that a customer starts to use it and they like the benefits. And so there's -- they then start to grow in the way that they use it and expand. And as we continue to see that growth too, we can add more options and other functionality to that, that over time grows and grows. And so this is not a -- we have flipped the switch on My Cintas and now let's see how many people we get, how many customers we get adopting. This is really -- we've opened it and this is going to grow -- just the product itself is going to continue to grow and add opportunity for us. So more and more customers will be added, but also more and more functionality will come with it into the future. And so to Todd's point, this is a journey, and it's an evolution, and we are in the very early stages of it.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Paul Adler for closing remarks.\nPaul F. Adler: Okay, Ross. Thank you all for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 financial results in July, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Todd M. Schneider",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Third quarter total revenue grew 11.7% to $2.19 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. The benefit of our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Excluding a gain in the related tax benefit in last year's third quarter, operating income margin increased 110 basis points to 20.4% and diluted EPS grew 16.7% to $3.14. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other.  The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $1.72 billion compared to $1.55 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 10.8%. While price increases contributed at a higher level than historically, revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance.  Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the third quarter was $231.6 million compared to $213 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 7.8%. The segment was up against a difficult revenue comparison because last year's third quarter revenue included about $15 million in sales of COVID-19 test kits that did not repeat this year. Excluding the prior year test kit sales, the organic revenue growth rate was 16%. We continue to have good momentum in our First Aid Cabinet business, which continues to grow greater than 20%.  Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the all other segment. All other revenue was $242.2 million compared to $194.3 million last year. The fire business revenue was 105 -- $155.8 million and the organic revenue growth rate was 20.7%. Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $86.5 million and the organic growth rate was 32%.  Now before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.67 billion to $8.75 billion to a range of $8.74 billion to $8.80 billion. The total growth rate of 11.3% to 12%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $12.50 to $12.80 to a range of $12.70 to $12.90, a growth rate of 12.6% to 14.4%. Mike? Good morning Manav. Thanks for the question. It is -- we're watching it very closely. Certainly, there's rumblings when you read the newspapers every day and what's going on in the marketplace, but our customers seem still quite solid. And it's always a very competitive marketplace, and we're competing quite well there. They like our products and services, and we help them run their business better. So -- and help free them up to take care of items to where they can focus on their business. So we like our value proposition and -- but we certainly prefer an environment where our customers are in a great strong economy. But we're not seeing it just yet. And -- but we're certainly watching it very closely and monitoring it and making sure that we're focused on providing great value for our customers. Yes, it's a good question. There's a whole lot of inputs to our success in growing our revenue at the levels that we're growing at, and it is exceeding our expectations. Certainly, new business is quite good. We really like that. Our retention levels are very attractive. Cross-sell that we've spoken about in the past is continuing to improve. And as we mentioned, pricing is above historical, but the volumes are really coming from the three areas that I mentioned. Keep in mind, the majority of the new accounts that we sell are new to our segment, meaning we call them new programmers, so we're growing the pie, not taking -- just taking share. We certainly love to do both, but growing the pie has been something that we are quite good at and have done consistently over the years, and we still -- we think the future is quite bright there. Faiza, I'll start, and then Mike can certainly chime in. As far as our results are quite good, we usually do grow in multiples of GDP. And -- but we like where we are and where we're heading. Regarding SAP, we're very much in the early innings of SAP. That is the umbrella of our technology investment or the digitization of our business. And we went through all the implementation, which we're still -- there's always work to be done there. But nevertheless, we're seeing benefits from our technology investments. Our customers are seeing benefits from our technology investments. And we certainly love when we derive efficiencies from technology, but we get even more excited when our customers see benefits, giving us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. So we've talked in the past about the certain advantages that we get with technology investments. My Cintas portal is one of the more obvious ones that the customers see an advantage. They get to be able to manage their account. They make request the majority of our requests are done outside of normal business hours. So our customers don't always just want to be able to deal with our service provider in person or call our office during normal business hours. So they like to be able to do the flexibility to do business on their time and to get things off their list and move it on to ours. And that portal allows that flexibility for them and it's showing up in customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. So yes, very much on the early innings of our technology deployment, I can certainly speak more to that, if you like. Certainly, the healthcare business is a great vertical for us. We have spent years organizing appropriately around that with our service providers, our sales partners, and we've organized around products and services that they find attractive. And so a good example of that is -- let me back up, so our growth rates are very attractive there. They're in excess of where we're running in totality and they're primarily due to what I just described, but also some specific products that we have launched. And we've spoken a little bit about the scrub business. When the scrub business historically was not a real attractive business for us and the reason being it was low-quality products, heavy low margin, and just they were kind of not treated as a disposable, but pretty close to a disposable product. And we changed the game on that when we launched our garment dispensing service there, which controls the inventory levels for our customers. And here's the big thing is it what it -- because the technology controls it and only allows what the administrator of the hospital says each person can get, then what allows us to do is to provide a higher quality product but not be dealing with such low cost, low margin products. The customer is happier, we control the cost so much better because the inventory is controlled. So that's a great example of one of the innovations that we brought to the healthcare industry. That certainly is a technology that people value, and it's helping us grow that business really attractively. And we're still very much in the early innings of that. So hopefully, that gives you a little more color. Yes, thanks for the question George. I would say that the selling environment is very similar. It has not really changed much. Sales cycles, they're not elongating the -- what's going on with our customers, they're still fighting to bring people on to make sure that they're providing the right levels of service. And in these types of environments, we help provide value to them. We provide a benefit to them running their business. And in many cases, we're able to help customers save money from what they were doing. So I spoke earlier about when you walk into a customer and they're not a programmer, well they still have products that -- probably that they have procured on their own kind of a do-it-yourself and they're struggling to keep up with that. And in many cases, because of our scale and our ability to source products and the fact that we are already there, servicing them in many cases, we can provide great value for them and actually help lower their costs. So -- and we've seen that throughout the years, and that's a real benefit as we go through trying to provide value for our customers. So, generally speaking, George, I would say the selling environment is pretty similar -- not a whole lot of change over the past six months or so. Yes, Hans, it's a good question and good morning. Certainly, we're very happy with the trends that we're seeing in the gross margin in the First Aid business, but we're very happy in general with the First Aid business. It is -- execution is at a very high level. Certainly, the mix of business is we're benefiting from since PPE sales and safety sales tend to be lower margin, but there is strong demand for what we are providing. Health and Wellness is resonating in the marketplace. The mantra that we have in that business is what's more important to a business than the health and safety of their people. So -- and that is resonating. And so we're getting good leverage from the growth and the mix, but strong execution and we really like how we're operating in that business. Yes. It's -- certainly, the comps in Q4 are quite challenging and as Mike mentioned, we do expect that to moderate. The Uniform Direct Sale business is a little lumpier and sometimes, things come through based upon customer demand a little faster or what have you. But certainly, the comps in Q4 are tougher, and that's part of our guide. Mike, if I can add, Andrew, certainly, in this type of inflationary environment, it's challenging to grow gross margin. We've been quite successful in doing so. Getting good leverage on that revenue has been key for us. But managing our variable costs, it's -- that is just simply part of our culture, managing it very, very closely. So that's been big. But to Mike's point, in leveraging some of our digital transformation, Smart Truck has been very important to us. And then also the -- managing our inventory at our used stock rooms has been really important. And we have good systems in place there that allows us to get better reuse, which is better for the customer because the speed at which we can provide products goes up because it's right there available locally, don't have to get it from a distribution center and ship it into us. And it also, obviously, helps the amortization schedule when you can get better reuse of that current product that you're already paying for. So, the leverage that we're getting as a result of the systems and processes we put in place with technology have -- are paying off. Well, certainly Sam, we watch the energy prices very closely. Fuel, as in diesel and gasoline, hasn't changed that much year over prior. Natural gas, we're watching, and we expect that, that will be a benefit in the near future and the electricity it doesn't change a whole lot. So I wouldn't say that you can count on significant tailwind there. We are certainly not when you think about energy as a percent of sales, I think we came in at 2.15% energy as a percent of sales. So we like when they're coming down, and we manage it as they're going up, but I wouldn't expect a real change there. Yes. Good question, Sam. Yes, we absolutely see opportunities still to come with Smart Truck. It's -- one of the things that we are very careful about is it's -- when you route a new customer, that's one thing. But when you are rerouting your existing customer base, we're very judicious about that because changing the face of the service provider can sometimes bring issues, meaning they love their service provider and now you change it. So you got to be really careful with that. So you're going to see -- I would expect benefits in that area for years to come. And that shows up in energy, in emissions, but it shows up also in productivity because our partners have more time to spend with the customers and they can provide more value to the customers. And as one of the things we talk often about here is, we don't generate any revenue when the wheels are moving. It's only when the wheels stop. So we're very focused on that, but you're going to see it, I think, for years to come. Yes, good morning Heather. I'd say that trend continues. There's still people, our customers still are -- there's still 10 million job openings, folks trying to attract talent and trying to run their business and provide the levels of service that their customers expect. And when we have the ability to outsource items for them at very competitive rates, and again, in many cases, because we're already there, then that makes it quite attractive. And it's one of these like, oh my gosh, you can take this off my plate, then please, take it off my plate. And we leverage that and we'll continue to leverage that. So economic cycle aside, customers still need to take care of their customers and we can help them do exactly that. So we'll be focused on providing that value and managing our cost structure so that we can do it at very competitive rates. Yes, good question, Heather. So we're interested in M&A, certainly in our rental business, in our First Aid business and our Fire business. And we make acquisitions every year, every quarter, it seems in each of those businesses. But they're usually reasonably small. Some of them are geographic expansion, some of them are tuck-in. So it's a real mixture. And M&A tends to ebb and flow a bit. It's tough to predict timing, but we're interested in M&A in all those businesses. They have to be the right businesses, meaning well-run businesses, but large, medium, small, we are interested in all and each of those businesses. Yes, Toni, [Technical Difficulty] today. The labor market in general is easier than it was six months ago. It's certainly not easy still. And so we're focused on staffing at the level to make sure that we provide really good customer service. And so that's where we are. We will adjust accordingly if the economic cycle changes. And we're watching it really closely, as you can imagine, to make sure that we're providing the right service, the right value to our customers. But we certainly have a watchful eye out to understand if demand starts to change based upon what's going on in the broader economy. Yes, Toni. So our pricing, it varies based upon -- pricing is a local subject. So we handle it differently in different businesses and different geographies. So that being said, yes, our pricing is above what it has been historically. That being said, the volume growth is the majority of our growth. And the reason being is the inflationary environment is such that we have to pass on a larger price increase than we do historically. Fortunately, the customers are -- they understand that. They understand the environment, and we've been very successful in providing the right levels of service so that they are open to those adjustments. We're not here to give guidance beyond Q4 but certainly, if the work of the Fed is such that it brings inflation down, then we'll manage our business accordingly to match that. Yeah, thank you Shlomo for the question. We have a really diverse customer base. And so no, we are not more geared towards the medium-sized -- small, medium, large customers, geographic, different verticals. We have a really diverse customer base. And when you think about our business now, it is more geared towards the service economy than it is just goods producing. And so you name it, we've got it. We've got some small customers that are struggling. We've got some that are thriving. And that is really more dependent upon their business, there maybe -- their particular environment. And the same goes for the medium and the larger customers. It's a real mix and we work with them. So we have a customer who is particularly struggling, then we pivot and try to adjust accordingly. If their demand is such that it's coming down, then we pivot and handle it accordingly. But again, we also have other products and services that they might be procuring elsewhere where we might help them and provide cost savings to them. So, it varies based upon the customer but we are focused on providing that value and we will continue to focus on that. Scott, I'd just like to add, certainly what Mike was talking about, it starts with great growth. That is so critical to us. But part of our culture here is we're focused on extracting inefficiencies out of our business. And we've -- and I spoke earlier that there's a lot of inputs to revenue growth, and there's a lot of inputs to margin improvement. And Mike went through a list, which was pretty darn comprehensive. But generally speaking, the -- I'll just say that we're focused on and we're not going to just grow through pricing, and we're going to find a way in these types of environments to extract the inefficiencies so that we can grow margins, which in these type of inflationary environments are certainly is very challenging, but the team is doing a heck of a job, and we're quite proud of it. Yes. Certainly, Scott. It is -- you're talking about changing behavior within customers. So it tends to be a higher percentage of new customers that are coming on board that are participating at a high level. And the reason being is, it's new behavior, period. So then changing the customer -- the current customer behavior takes longer. And because they're used to a certain way of how we're doing business and some are leaning into it faster than others. But we're -- we see a very long runway here of benefits that we're going to get. And where does it show up? It shows up in so many places, but certainly trying to be easier to do business with is a focus here, and it makes it easier to do business with us. So I think you'll see that benefit for years to come."

            "name": "J. Michael Hansen",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 third quarter revenue was $2.19 billion compared to $1.96 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 11.8%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $1 billion compared to $898.2 million last year, an increase of 15.1%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 45.8% last year, an increase of 140 basis points. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 15 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 51.6% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.5% for Fire Protection Services and 35.8% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $446.8 million compared to $407.6 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 20.8% in last year's third quarter. Fiscal 2022 third quarter operating income included a $30.2 million gain on an equity method investment transaction. The gain was recorded in selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this gain, fiscal 2023 third quarter operating income as a percentage of revenue was 20.4% compared to 19.3% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 110 basis points.  Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.1% compared to 18.2% last year. The fiscal 2022 third quarter equity method investment transaction included a significant tax benefit. Excluding the transaction, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 19.6%. Net income for the third quarter was $325.8 million compared to $315.4 million last year. This year's third quarter diluted EPS of $3.14 compared to $2.97 last year. However, fiscal 2022 third quarter diluted EPS contained $0.28 from the gain on the equity method investment transaction, which included a related $0.07 tax rate benefit. Excluding this gain and the related benefit -- the related tax benefit, fiscal 2023 third quarter diluted EPS of $3.14 compared to $2.69 in last year's third quarter, an increase of 16.7%. Cash flow remains strong. On December 15, 2022 we paid shareholders $117.4 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 18.6% from the amount paid the previous December.  Todd provided our annual financial guidance related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal 2022 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and again on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal 2022 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal 2023 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.77 billion to $1.80 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains. Fiscal 2023 interest expense is expected to be $112 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal 2022 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.7%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal 2022 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes significant economic disruptions or downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul. Andrew, the fourth quarter guide would contemplate 6.5% to 9.5% revenue growth. But keep in mind, we've talked a lot about the direct sale business, which grew 32% in the third quarter, and it is coming up against tougher comps. And so we just don't see that kind of growth continuing and settling back into what we would say is a typical growth rate for direct sale in that low single digits. So that's the primary change that we see in the fourth quarter. Well, I'll say this, Todd, just talked about the -- we haven't seen much change in customer behavior and the demand has still been really good and the momentum in the rental business is good. And while I'm not ready to say we're guiding to a specific number, we don't see much change to it coming into the fourth quarter. Momentum still is strong. Before you get into that, Todd, I just might remind -- provide a reminder that, look, we love the market opportunity also for our business. And it's -- we look at it as a very, very big opportunity. So in other words, when we talk about we have a little bit over 1 million customers, there are 16 million customers or 16 million businesses in the U.S. and Canada, we're just continuing to try to highlight that there is a great market opportunity, and Todd brought up the point that when the majority of our new business is expanding the served market or tapping into that large market potential, it means that we can grow in those multiples of GDP and employment growth for a long period of time. I think it's important to keep that in mind as you think about the growth potential over the longer term, that market opportunity is great. George, I don't know if I can specifically separate the guidance raise. But clearly, we had a nice third quarter and the performance was strong from the organic growth to the gross margins to the operating margin. So a pretty solid quarter all the way through. And our guide for Q4 would suggest we expect more of the same. So the guide would suggest we expect another nice quarter. Hard to separate though for us exactly what the difference is because our internal expectations are a little bit different than our external, I'll say, consensus and guide. Sure. So I'll start with material cost, Andrew. Let me start with we source or direct the sourcing of more than 90% of our volume and more than 90% of our items have more than one source. And that's really important to keep in mind so that when our vendors may have inflationary pressures on them, the thing to remember is we have choices. And so sometimes that means we do have to take increases, but many times, it means we have -- we can flex and we can negotiate and we can -- again, we have choices. And so we don't always have to accept every vendor price increase that comes our way when we direct to sourcing ourselves and when we have multiple sources, that's really important. The other thing is, obviously, the amortization of this bucket of expenses allows us to see ahead, to anticipate what's coming.  So as you can imagine, when a vendor does come to us and has a price increase, that -- it takes a while to, first of all, build the inventory and then it goes to our distribution centers. And then for after a turn, it comes into our rental locations, and that's where the amortization starts. And in month one, we have 1/18th of that inflation for garments, for example, 1/48th of that for entrance mats. And so you can kind of get a feel for it. It takes a long time for those inflationary pressures to come to us. That means we can do lots of planning. We can think about initiatives that we have going on, and we can accelerate some of those. We can think about process improvement and we can implement those, but we can also give in at least one annual price increase and maybe multiple price increases before that full inflation hits us. So we can really get ahead of that kind of cost. So we have choices, and we can really see ahead of that. And that gives us a really nice opportunity to plan the business without a lot of disruption.  The other thing I'll say, Andrew, is we've got a lot of infrastructure. We've got a lot of facilities and trucks and things, rents. And those aren't quite as disrupted by inflation or at least immediately. And so again, we can get with our great growth, we can get some really nice leverage on that part of our cost structure. And then when you think about labor that you touched on, Andrew, we certainly want to make sure that we are maintaining the absolute best partner engagement that we can, and that means we like to be at market or slightly above market rates, that's important for us in terms of the labor rates. But we've talked about -- we've had a couple of things happen over the course of the last five or six years. One is, we had a lot of gene case synergies being realized over the course of the last six years, and that allowed us to be a little bit more aggressive on raising rates. So we were never caught flat footed in terms of when the labor challenges hit. That was -- that's been important to us, and it's been -- it has allowed us to kind of keep disruption down.  But the other thing is, we've talked a lot about initiatives like Smart Truck. We talked a lot about the technology impacts in our facilities that allow us to be more efficient. So that means as we are growing, we don't need to add as many resources within the plants or on the routes, and that allows us to leverage that labor environment even in this period of time where we've got raising labor rates. Well, the first thing that I'll say is the most important thing for us is to make sure that we're investing in the right way for a long-term success of the business. And so we want to make sure that we are growing capacity as needed with our growth, that we're training our partners, that we're doing the things that we need to do to continue to grow long term. We are still -- we still want to be very acquisitive. It's hard to pinpoint when those may or may not happen, but we want to continue to be acquisitive. We talked about the dividend a little bit and that we've raised it almost 20% this past year. And certainly, while we didn't do any buybacks in the last quarter, that remains an opportunity for us as we look forward. Andy, we want to make sure that we are prudent in the way that we invest our cash. And so sometimes that means we may take a little bit longer to deploy cash but we want to make sure more than anything. Job number one is, long-term growth of the business, both on the top line and on the bottom line and are we doing the right things in order to make that happen and then prudently look for ways to enhance that. Yes, just to frame it a little bit, Sam. Last year in the fourth quarter, our total energy was 2.5% of revenue. In the first quarter, it was 2.4%. This time, it was 2.15%. So we may see a little bit of a benefit in Q4 and Q1. But boy, we've worked so hard to get this to be such a small part of our cost structure that I'm not sure the benefit is going to be that significant one way or the other. Well, I'll say free cash flow, I think your point is a good one from the perspective of -- it's a little bit transitory, but in the way of, look, we're coming off of a fiscal 2021 year where there wasn't a lot of growth and then really getting some nice acceleration into fiscal 2022 and 2023. And so there is a little bit of -- as we have used capacity through the pandemic, we've gotten back into a time period where we need some capacity here and there. And we've been really good at managing the capacity in many different ways, whether it is, for example, better efficiency in our existing wash alleys to adding a washer to adding a dryer to maybe then adding a new facility. But we've gotten to the point where it's time to add capacity again, and that's healthy. But I would call that there is a little bit of a mismatch there that we're catching up a bit from that. Having said that, look, we still expect free cash flow to be very, very strong. And whenever we're growing nicely, we're going to use some working capital. That's just the nature of our business. And that's a good thing. But you're right, there's a little bit of a catch-up in our capital expenditures, and we'll start to I'll say, those will get more in sync as we go into the next year and following years, assuming there's no other economic disruption. Yes, it's going to be close -- we certainly don't expect it to be down at that 2% level. It's going to be closer to that 4% level as we think about moving forward. Toni, I might just add that the pricing that Todd talked about earlier is relative to historical levels, not -- we were not pointing out that there is a sequential increase in that level of pricing. So if that's where your question might have been coming from, it's really that relative to the historical levels of pricing. We're certainly above that, but not a real change in practice sequentially. Yeah, well there is always pushback from customers, always have and always will be. The current environment with inflation levels make it an opportunity for us to do so better than historical, larger than historical. But I wouldn't tell you that the environment has changed dramatically. But certainly inflation is starting to, it appears to come down and so we are managing our business accordingly and we will manage our customers accordingly as well. Well Scott, look, it starts with great growth. And when we are growing our top line at healthy levels, we're going to get some nice leverage. I talked a little bit about in a previous response, I talked a little bit about that the cost structure of having some costs that are a little bit in that infrastructure type of a bucket that when we grow real nicely, we get some great leverage. And that happened in all of our businesses. The growth that we saw in the third quarter was broad-based in all four of our businesses, and that leads to some really nice leveraging in each of those businesses. I talked a little bit about that amortizing aspect of material costs, particularly within the rental business, and again that allows us to see things coming, and it allows us to plan accordingly. And so again, the growth helps in that area, but it also allows us to think about things like process improvements, Smart Truck that you mentioned. And in all of our businesses, we've got those kinds of initiatives. And all of them are -- we're hard at work in all of them. And so we're seeing benefits from process improvement. Some are just simply better improvements, better training, and some are technology related, like the Smart Truck. We've got all of them in each of the businesses, and that is adding to it.  Now certainly, the First Aid margin moving from 12.4% last year to 20.4% this year, there is the mix benefit that we're certainly getting in that space. But we also have lots of other good things going on in there. We are sourcing better in First Aid and Safety. And we do have some really nice process improvement opportunities going on there, and we've initiated Smart Truck in the First Aid and Safety business and in the Fire business. So certainly, First Aid has been a big part of that margin improvement, but we've seen it all. So it's hard -- I don't have specific numbers to give you, Scott, but it starts with great growth and leverage and then we get into better sourcing, process improvement, technology gains, and certainly then healthy mix. All of those things have contributed. It's a little bit of an evolution with My Cintas in that a customer starts to use it and they like the benefits. And so there's -- they then start to grow in the way that they use it and expand. And as we continue to see that growth too, we can add more options and other functionality to that, that over time grows and grows. And so this is not a -- we have flipped the switch on My Cintas and now let's see how many people we get, how many customers we get adopting. This is really -- we've opened it and this is going to grow -- just the product itself is going to continue to grow and add opportunity for us. So more and more customers will be added, but also more and more functionality will come with it into the future. And so to Todd's point, this is a journey, and it's an evolution, and we are in the very early stages of it."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Adler: Thanks, Russ, and thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2023 second quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Paul. Second quarter total revenue grew 13.1% to $2.17 billion. Each of our businesses increased revenue at a double-digit rate. The benefits of our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 20.5% and diluted EPS grew 13% to $3.12. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.71 billion compared to $1.54 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11.3%. Revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. Challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs, businesses continue to turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. Additionally, price increases contributed at a higher level than historically. We believe such a mix of revenue drivers, volume and price is healthy and supportive of continued long-term growth. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter was $236.0 million compared to $202.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 15.1%. This rate reflects the continued momentum of our First Aid cabinet business, which continues to grow more than 20%. Whether it is COVID-19 or influenza, the health and safety of employees remains top-of-mind. We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in workplace. Personal Protective Equipment or PPE, while still elevated compared to pre-COVID levels, declined slightly on a sequential basis. The revenue mix-shift benefits our financial results because the cabinet service is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins than PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $228.9 million compared to $184.9 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 18.0% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 33.9%. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our second quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.58 billion to $8.67 billion to a range of $8.67 billion to $8.75 billion, a total growth rate of 10.4% to 11.4%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $12.30 to $12.65 to a range of $12.50 to $12.80, a growth rate of 10.8% to 13.5%. Mike?\nMike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 second quarter revenue was $2.17 billion compared to $1.92 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 12.8%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $1 billion compared to $885.1 million last year, an increase of 15.5%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47% for the second quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 46% last year. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a headwind, increasing 10 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services. 50.5% for First Aid and Safety Services. 47.4% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.2% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $444.9 million compared to $381.2 million last year. Fiscal '23 second quarter operating income increased 16.7% and operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 20.5% from 19.8% last year. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.1% compared to 18% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the second quarter was $324.3 million compared to $294.7 million last year, an increase of 10.1%. This year's diluted EPS of $3.12 compared to $2.76 last year, an increase of 13%. We had to overcome higher inflation, interest expense and tax rate, therefore we are especially pleased with these financial results. Cash flow remains strong on September 15th, 2022. We declared dividends and pay them on December 15th, 2022 in the amount of $117.4 million in quarterly dividends. To provide our annual -- Todd provided our annual financial guidance related to the guidance. Please note the following. Fiscal '22 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and a gain on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal '22 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal '23 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.79 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains. Fiscal '23 interest expense is expected to be $113 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal '22 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal '23 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.7%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. Please keep the following in mind when modeling third quarter versus fourth quarter financial results. The number of work days in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal '23 are unchanged from fiscal '22. There are 64 days in the third quarter and 66 days in the fourth. Less work days results in less revenue to cover certain fixed and amortizing costs. In last year's third quarter, First Aid and Safety sold about $15 million in COVID test kits. We don't expect that revenue to repeat this year. Uniform Direct Sale organic revenue growth rates have been very strong year-to-date, however we expect these rates to be pressured in the second half of the fiscal year as the business faces increasingly challenging comparisons. Payroll taxes reset in our fiscal third quarter, increasing our SG&A costs on a sequential basis. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul.\nPaul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead, Faiza.\nFaiza Alwy: You've had really good results. So congratulations on that. I'm curious how would you characterize your outperformance. Has it been more because of new business? Has pricing come in sort of better than you expected? And maybe as part of that, if you could talk about your SAP program, like how much of a benefit do you think that has had over the during the course of this year?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Faiza. Thank you for your question. Yes, we, our beat on the revenue side are driven significantly by new business, it's continues to be a very attractive for us. But we are selling more items into our customer base. So it's pretty broad. I mentioned in the prepared comments that pricing is above what our historical experience has been. As you can imagine, due to the experience with inflation that we're seeing across our organization. But it is -- but the primary drivers volume growth and we're benefiting from that. We're investing for that and things are -- we like the trend there. As far as on the margin side, we are committed that we are not going to be solely focused on growing margins because of pricing. In fact, we are dedicated to finding efficiencies in our business, some of that is through revenue leverage just general revenue leverage that we get, but we are focused on finding efficiencies and you mentioned SAP certainly that technology is helping us significantly. We've had -- we've talked about our -- the digitization. Our digital transformation of our business that has been very, very important to us and we're seeing benefits whether it's in our routing efficiencies, productivity of our sales partners, be getting better reuse of our products, in-service inventory because of SAP. Those are all benefits that we're seeing and the marketplace is noticing it and it's helping us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. And then as we look ahead some companies have started talking about, started sounding a little bit more cautious, as you know, a lot of economists are forecasting a potential recession. Talk about how do you, how does, you talked previously about how your business might get impacted, but talk about like what's the sales pitch during a recession. I think that would be helpful for us to hear.\nTodd Schneider: Great. First off, we continue to watch our customer base very closely. We're looking at all of our data to see if there's some trends that we might see if customers are consuming less and what have you. So we're watching that. Now as far as in a recession every recession that I've been -- I've experienced while at Cintas over the last 33 years, we've always sold an attractive amount of new business. And the reason being is, we hope businesses and in an environment, that we help them, position them for success as far as, if they're in the business and they have less people, then somebody still has to take care of certain functions. So we're able to sell value there. If they are in an environment where they're looking to save money, there's in many cases we're able to save them money. It's not that they are. We're always asking for increased spend. It's just redirect the spend to us. And in many cases, we're able to help customers with that instead of spending it with some other vendor or with an outsourced item that they bring it to us. And we can bring efficiencies to them. So we fully expect that we -- our new business will be attractive in any type of economic environment. Certainly, we prefer when the economy is growing robustly, but we'll find ways to be successful in whatever the environment.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish.\nJohn Mazzoni: Hi, this is John, filling in for Ashish. Congratulations on the strong results. Maybe just following-up on Faiza's question, could you talk more about kind of retention, as well as just what the current customer conversations are going like today? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yes, thank you, John. I'll speak to it if, Mike, if you'd like to contribute on this subject. But, first off, our retention levels are quite attractive. We very much like where they are. We're focused on making sure that our customer is - it's why we wake up in the morning, is to take care of them, and that focus that culture is pervasive and we're making sure that our partners are positioned to be able to make sure they can take care of them and exceed their expectations. So all that is attractive for us and keep in mind we have a really broad customer base. So we serve over million customers that we see on a very consistent basis. Some are doing some are challenged in the current economic environment, whether they struggle to find people or they're struggling with the wage inflation or inflation in general and then we have other customers that are thriving in this type of environment and frankly we have everything in between. And but generally speaking, what we see are, it's still -- we still like what we see with our customer base. And I think that broad customer base is a real benefit for us.\nJohn Mazzoni: That's great color. Thank you. Maybe quickly to follow-up. Could you just talk about capital allocation and if there's any change there, just what you're seeing today in M&A given some of the more challenging headwinds with inflationary pressures?\nMike Hansen: Sure, John. This is Mike and we haven't changed our philosophy in terms of capital allocation. We want to continue to invest in the business. And certainly, as we've seen the accelerated growth over the last three quarters, we are investing in the business, but we love M&A and we continue to have all of the discussions to try to keep that pipeline active, but it always takes to come to a decision and we are working those conversations hard and our expectation is that we will be able to continue in the M&A path, but that's we certainly love that option. And certainly, we -- I misspoke a minute ago on dividends. We paid a dividend in September - on September 15th, we paid another one on December 15th, and we certainly have increased the dividend every year we've gone public. We like that option as well and then the buyback continues to be an opportunistic alternative for us when we have excess cash, so no philosophy changes. We're still working all of those in the same way that we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.\nGeorge Tong: You mentioned you're continuing to sell more items to your existing customers. Can you describe how overall customer spending behaviors have evolved with the overall economy and if sales cycles have changed at all?\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, George, for the question, and good morning. Again, we have a very broad customer base. And we have a very broad product offering and we're blessed to have both and as a result we're organized in a manner where we're trying to make sure that our customers know everything that we have to offer, they don't always. We've spoken in the past about how going through the pandemic was really, really challenging. One of the positive outputs of that was the fact that our customer base saw the broadness of our offering and in many cases didn't realize we had products and services that we have. So we're focused on that. We're trying to provide more value. When we do that, it is, it helps us because we're -- when we stop our truck and the invoice is larger that's good leverage for us. So we'll provide more value to the customer and we're getting leverage in that manner. So all that's positive. So as far as the sales process being elongated. We're not saying that at this point. And as I mentioned earlier, we are certainly seeing a mix out there. Some customers are struggling and some are doing quite well and everything in-between. But generally speaking the customer base continues to head in a positive manner.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. The upside in revenue this quarter was driven I think significantly by new business. Approximately how much of the new business growth in the quarter came from the no programmer market or Uniform Rentals?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, good question, George. So no programmers continues to be a really great opportunity for us. The majority of our new accounts that we sell are in the no programmers section. And so we've been focused on that. We train our partners on that. And those that set of prospects sees value in what we provide. And as a result, the TAM is massive and so that's very exciting for us and we see very nice growth opportunities into the future.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead, Andy.\nAndy Wittmann: I guess I wanted to ask on the First Aid segment, Mike. The margins in particular I think really stood out. You made the comment that you're getting some favorable mix shift as the PPE is rolling out. Last quarter's margins were also very good. I think better than most people expected. So it feels like there's something pretty sustainable in the margin rates. Would you agree with that assessment or is there something in there that we should be aware of as we come to 2Q fiscal '24 as a tough comp or something, maybe just some detail as to what's really driving these margins that are really frankly kind of a step function better than what you put up in the past?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Andy, you're right, the margins are better than historical. The mix shift has been great. We have a -- there's a number of areas where we're able to gain leverage. Certainly the new business is a very nice lever for us. The change in -- I'll call it society and the focus on health and wellness is a real tailwind for us. And so as a result of that cabinet revenue growth is very attractive for us that affects the mix, but we are also finding, I mentioned we've got -- we're finding efficiencies in throughout our business. And First Aid is included in that. And so whether it's routing technology. We've been on SAP and First Aid for a little bit longer, but we're finding efficiencies and we have a very strong supply chain that is finding opportunities to source better and improve our overall operating margins. And Mike, anything you'd like to contribute there?\nMike Hansen: The only thing I might add is to specifically, Andy, nothing to call out that there is one-time or short-term in nature. It's just that the business is performing very, very well.\nAndy Wittmann: Great. I guess kind of similar question, different segments on the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. Obviously, you're getting good gross margin leverage, which says a lot about all the things you've already talked about. You mentioned making investments in the business. It appears that the SG&A line and the Uniform Rental segment in particular has been seeing investments there. And I was just wondering maybe you could provide some detail as to what kinds of investments you're making or if it's maybe just still kind of return from COVID and getting some travel and T&E back in there. Maybe just a little detail about SG&A in the rental segment.\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Andy, good question. We're excited about the gross margin improvement that we're seeing in that business. Despite a 20 basis points headline that we're that we're up against in energy still. So, you're right, the SG&A is up. It's there is we're making investments in the business and appropriately so. Also some G&A medical costs, workers' comp and what have you are higher this quarter and there's always some puts and takes as it relates to that, but we are guiding towards for the whole year in that business, incrementals in the 20% to 30% range and we are, as I mentioned, that margin expansion is going to come in a number of ways, but revenue growth leverage, productivity, which is a broad word, right. There are so many areas where we get productivity improvements and pricing. But, yes, so we're focused on improving the margins there and we'll manage through the G&A investment, the SG&A investment as we move forward.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.\nTim Mulrooney: Two questions. One on labor. We've heard from others -- other industries and companies that labor availability today still remains somewhat a governor growth. I mean has that been the case for you guys? Are you holding back in certain markets due to constraints around qualified labor and just generally how would you characterize the labor availability situation today versus say last quarter?\nTodd Schneider: Thanks for the question, Tim, good morning. As far as labor is concerned, the -- I'll call the labor market in totality, easier, but not easy. It is still certainly challenging there. We care passionately about how that looks for our customers and how it impacts our customers. I mentioned some are struggling to staff still and as a result, that affects their business, which impacts us. So but from his standpoint of Cintas and how we're staffed that is not affecting our growth rate, it would be more about how our customers are impacted. I can tell you it wouldn't go well here. If someone said I can't grow as fast as you think I should because I can't staff. We figure that out and we think the environment that we provide for our partners where they have great opportunities and a great wage and benefits and great security and great development is a real advantage for us in the marketplace. So as far as Cintas staffing that is not slowing us up. Certainly, our customers could be impacted by that to some degree.\nTim Mulrooney: That's good. That's good color, Todd. I mean, it's good to know, I mean there are some companies we've talked to that are literally dialing back on sales and marketing costs just because they can't find a labor to support the growth. So that's good to know you guys aren't in a situation. One more from me on wage rate inflation. I'm curious what that's running at approximately right now for your folks actually out on the routes and how does that compare to your historical averages? Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Wage rates. I don't have an exact number to give you, but we start with the answer and work backwards. And the answer is, we've got to have great people, we've got to have really well-trained and prepared people who can help us be successful and take care of our customers. So is above historical. Yes, it is above historical but nevertheless we're focused on putting the very, very best team out on the field, so that we can take great care of our customers and prepare us for the future of this organization.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. I guess just to follow-up a little bit. There's a lot of press out there around C-Suite anxiety, right. And I just wanted to know, historically, I guess, how long before that starts flowing all the way down to kind of your direct customers on the street and how quickly can you react because your current guidance obviously is through me. And so things might be fine till then I was just curious if there is a timing element that we should be considering to.\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Manav, thanks for the question. Yes, we always have anxiety, right. It's part of making sure you're sharp and but nevertheless it is, we do worry about do our, as an economy, do we talk ourselves into pulling back and is that happen to our customer base and does that happen as a ripple effect and but we're not seeing it. We're again, our customer base. It's so broad. Some are doing great. Some are not. But in general we like the direction of our customer base and we in many ways we hope they don't read the press and they stay focused on taking care of their business and investing for the future. And but we'll see what that holds and how the Fed handles things and how that might impact the general economy.\nMike Hansen: Manav, I might add, you go back 2.5 years to the pandemic to the beginning of the pandemic. I think we show that we can be pretty nimble when it comes to our cost structure and adapting to changes in the environment.\nManav Patnaik: Yes, that's fair. And Mike maybe if I could just ask a follow-up just on CapEx and free-cash flow expectations for the year. Any changes or help there?\nMike Hansen: Well, look, we -- what you've seen maybe in the first half of this year is when we grow and we've seen three quarters now straight of double-digit organic growth. So a nice actually four quarters, so a nice acceleration in the performance. And when we grow and the volumes are healthy, we certainly invest in the business and that investment can come through in the way of working capital. And so you see a little bit more working capital usage in our cash flow statement. And that's not necessarily unusual for us when we see an acceleration in the growth rate. But we like our cash flow. It will continue to be strong and this year should not be an exception to that. And that cash flow. I talked a few minutes ago about capital allocation and the cash flow that we've got going on this year will not force us to make choices. We can still do all of the capital allocation that we typically think about. So we like where we are.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, Todd, Mike and Paul. I wanted to ask a little bit about merchandise amortization, kind of given the strength of Cintas' new business, which usually has uniforms going into service. You know, how did merchandise amortization affect gross margins? I mean rental gross margins in the second quarter? You know, obviously, I know rental gross margins were up despite any effect of merchandise amortization. And do you expect rental gross margins to be up in the second half of the year, year-over-year?\nTodd Schneider: Andrew we -- as it relates to the amortization, certainly you've seen the growth that I've talked about a few times and that translates into more garments and other products being injected into our in-service inventory. And we love that. We love when that happens. And so we're seeing growth in the amortization. But we're able to leverage that pretty nicely so far. And you know our business well. We amortize many of those rental products. And so we have good foresight or visibility into what's coming. And that means we can plan, we can source, we can increase prices when necessary. So the visibility gives us a nice advantage in terms of how we think about other ways of operating the business. And as it relates to the second half of the year, look, we don't typically provide guidance on gross margin specifically. But certainly the guidance that we've provided contemplates improvement in our operating margins in the second half of the year and the growth that we have on the top line and all of the other initiatives and things we've got going on. They are performing well and enabling us to do that, to do that margin improvement even in a difficult period of time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So your guidance for the rest of the year, I guess, for the back half implies growth probably on the sales side and the 8% to 9% range, which is moderating from what you did in the first half. I'm curious if you could just walk us through kind of where you're assuming there might be some deceleration. Is that just as you come off lapping the COVID recovery and maybe where there might be opportunity for upside just based on the strength you've seen year-to-date?\nTodd Schneider: Heather, thanks for the question. Yes, so a slight, but still very attractive growth. We like where that is. We're preparing for that. And but we are certainly up against some tougher comps in the back half, specifically with First Aid and Uniform Direct sale. So we'll be lapping those and but we like the growth levels and we find them quite attractive. And that's what we are preparing for.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. And do you think, you know, are there areas that you're seeing in your business. You know, you've done well year-to-date. You've raised your guidance sort of I know First Aid and Safety is very strong right now. Other sort of areas in your business, whether it's certain customers like your opportunity in health care or other business lines where you're really seeing outperformance and kind of growth beyond your typical run rate.\nTodd Schneider: Yes, good question. So again, our customer base is very broad, but I'll tell you this that our verticals where we're investing are, you know, health care, hospitality, education, government are performing quite well and they're growing at an accretive rate to our growth. And we think we choose them wisely and invested in them appropriately. And that customer base is doing well. Within that customer base, again, you get a mix, but nevertheless in general we like that area and it's growing very attractively for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead, Kartik.\nKartik Mehta: Thank you. I mean I know you've talked about the economy a few times. I'm wondering, as you look at some of the benchmarks for your business and maybe your customers businesses. Anything that stands out either that is positive that maybe you were anticipating would decline or anything that's negative that you are anticipating would be the other way.\nTodd Schneider: Kartik, it's a good question. I continue to talk about how broad our customer base is. So you name it, we see it. But the scarcity of employee -- of workers is an issue. Unemployment is still at a very, very low level. There's still, I think, 10 million job openings in the U.S. economy. So as a result of that, you know, people are, I think, careful about how they're handling their employees and being judicious about that.\nKartik Mehta: And then just last question. Just from an energy standpoint, obviously fuel prices are coming down. It seems as natural gas prices are coming down as well. Is the headwind you're anticipating from energy prices maybe what you anticipated at the beginning of the year when you gave guidance to now? Has that changed at all?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. So we still see energy as a headwind. And when you go to the pump right now, it is certainly a little bit lower than it was a quarter ago. But about 40% of our spend on energy is in natural gas for our production facilities and electric. And that is not heading in the right direction. Natural gas prices are up and electric prices are up. And so but certainly the attention more gets to everybody fills up at the pump for the most part, but not as much focus on natural gas or electric. But we're seeing it and it's I'm sure it's affecting households as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, Seth.\nSeth Weber: Hi, guys, good morning and happy holidays. I wanted to ask another margin question. Mike or Todd, I mean, the guidance for this year, the back half, it seems like you're the guidance kind of implies a higher than normal incremental margin. And I think, Todd, you mentioned the Uniform business could be 20% to 30% incrementals this year. Is this -- are we moving into a scenario where incrementals could be higher than your normal call it 20% to 25% range and maybe are you more comfortable talking in like a 25% to 30% range for the business going forward. Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Well, we haven't, Seth, we haven't really changed the narrative on that in terms of the 20% to 30%. But you know as -- there are different ebbs and flows within the business. And sometimes there are periods where we are investing maybe a little bit more than in other quarters et cetera. And, you know, Todd's focused on the full year results and the longer term results. And so there can be ups and downs, certainly, based on our guidance, we are contemplating margin improvement in the back half of the year. And I don't know that it's anything that we're ready to say is a new norm. It's just simply we look at the year and say we've got some really good incremental margins in that 20% to 30% range that will cause the full year margins to go up. But I wouldn't look at it as a new normal type of a thing. It's just simply there are ebbs and flows within the business and timing of investments, et cetera.\nSeth Weber: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just on the Fire business, the organic growth in the Fire business continues to be in this sort of mid to high teens range. Is that a sustainable number or do you feel like for Fire and just sort of maybe any color on really what's driving that unusually strong organic growth. Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Yes, Seth, I'll take that one. We love the Fire business. It's a very attractive business for us, it's the only business we're in where every business legally has to comply with the local laws around it. So the TAM is absolutely massive. And our sales team is doing really well and we're selling into additional customers. We're selling more into our existing customers. We've got a great offering. We really like our position in the marketplace. And the team is doing a heck of a job. So, yes, we would like to continue to grow that business at double-digit rates. Can it achieve the levels that where we are today, that would be outstanding. But certainly double-digits is our focus for that business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead, Shlomo.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you very much. I want to get a little follow-up on some of the questions on client hiring, which obviously could impact Cintas volumes. Do you feel like you really sell at a level in the organization that you get kind of an advance look at the hiring plans? Or is it really kind of you monitor it as it happens? So like in current you need to react because clients will just kind of add or subtract people kind of in the moment, but you don't -- it's not that you're getting a heads up on that. I'm just trying to understand like your view. Obviously, it's a very broad client base, but just in more generalities. And then there have been any changes, you used to talk about kind of an add stops metric. And I'm wondering if there's anything materially different in what that would look like now.\nTodd Schneider: Shlomo, great question. It really depends upon -- our view of the what the staffing levels of our customers will be. It really depends upon where our relationship is some they'll share with us. Hey, calendar '23, here's what we're thinking. Others, they don't depending upon our relationship levels or their planning level. And so in that case, it's a little bit more reactive. So, you name it, we have that type of experience where it's very transparent and we have a good. We can see around the corner with our expectations there. And then some are just very reactive and we have to see what's going on with their customers. So but generally speaking with add stops, I would say, we see our experiences continues and the patterns that we have in the past. And I mentioned earlier that, I don't know, certainly Q1 speaking of the economy Q1, Q2 was GDP shrunk. Q3 was slightly positive. We'll see what Q4. holds in store for GDP. It's tough to tell, if we're in a technical recession or if we're not and what calendar '23 holds in store for us. But the employment situation in the U.S. is still tough to get people and as I mentioned there's 10 million job openings. We'll see if that continues to decline. But we're trying to make sure that we're positioned to grow and but as Mike mentioned, if the economy affects our customer base in a very negative manner, we'll be prepared to pivot and manage our cost structure appropriately and we're planning on being successful in whatever the economic environment brings to us.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you. Just one follow-up on just on the pricing. Is it kind of normal now for the clients to expect these pricing increases or is it are you getting any material push-back on them as this time is going on?\nTodd Schneider: Shlomo, as I mentioned, in our prepared remarks, pricing is -- has always been a component of our growth. Same is the - what we went through with some serious economic turbulence with COVID-19 and what have you. So that being said, we're planning on growing our business most attractively through volume growth and getting leverage there and planning on growing margins via leverage on that revenue growth and finding efficiencies in our business. That being said, it's a very competitive environment. And as we talk to our customers, they certainly challenge us. And they want us to find efficiencies in our business and not just pass along cost to them and that's what we're focused on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning. Happy Holidays, everyone. First question in Uniform Rental. I'm just curious about the winning business you guys have obviously highlighted penetration of existing customers, strong volume growth, new customers. Could you speak to what is no programmer versus what is competitively won? Is there a lot of that activity right now of competitively won? And then if you could just kind of differentiate what you're seeing with large customers versus may be small and midsize in the context of that question. Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Scott. I'll start, Mike, if you want to contribute on this subject there. As far as the market, the competitive market. We sell a lot of no programmers. Certainly we do take business from our competitors, but that's, we find that there are so many businesses out there that say, wow, I didn't realize that you would serve a business of my size or I didn't realize you had those types of products and services and they see great value in what we do and so we're very focused on that. As far as the customer base, the larger customers, some of them are struggling, smaller ones are certainly some of them are struggling, but I would say, generally speaking, the smaller ones are probably a little under a little bit more pressure just because it's tough to attract retain staff, pay people and at the levels that you have to be competitive in the marketplace. So that's kind of a generalization that may not be completely fair and I could give you plenty of examples of smaller businesses that are thriving. But that's kind of a generalization I thought I might share with you.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, specifically, Uniform Direct sales, I think it was about 33%, 34% organic growth in the quarter. Very strong. I heard you mentioned on an earlier question that would be a segment facing some tougher comps in the back half of the fiscal year. If you just speak to kind of what the business activity has been there, what's driving the strong growth right now? What type of customers? Has it been particularly lumpy or is it been just a solid, broad based versus maybe just one or two big customer wins? Just a little bit more elaboration on that business line. Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Sure. Good question. Very broad based. It's not one customer or a couple customers. It's very broad based. And when you think about that, that area, certainly hospitality is a big component of it, but there's other customers that are national and scope type customers. But hospitality specifically I'll speak to, yes, they're struggling to staff, but there's a lot of demand out there in the hospitality sector. And as a result they need help. And you know and when you think of that, when they're struggling to staff and they have to provide products and services, we've become a very attractive opportunity for them to sole source and to provide products that they can get quickly and that are very attractive and allow them to provide the proper guest experience that they want to provide for their patrons.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a follow-up on pricing. I know you've been sort of putting through a higher level of price than normal recently, and now it sounds like, you know, obviously you've mentioned a couple of times that volume is going to be a bigger driver to growth. But I guess my question is pricing going to be more of a normal increase versus prior years or, you know, based on, you know, like the challenging macro, although you said you're not seeing it yet, like is it going to be lower than normal or roughly around sort of a normal year for pricing in calendar '23?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Toni, good question. As we think about pricing in the future, it certainly is above historical today. It's tough to predict what inflation holds in the future. But presuming that comes down, I'd say you'd see us closer to historical from a price adjustments. But it really depends upon what happens with the Fed, what happens with the economy, what happens with wage pressures are so many inputs. And that one's tough to predict. So but we're watching it very closely.\nToni Kaplan: Great. And then when you think about the margin expansion implied and you mentioned sort of higher margin expansion in the back half of the year, is that like I guess how much of it is a result of like energy costs coming down from prior levels or maybe inflation having reached its peak and coming down like I guess how much of it is that versus scale or initiatives, if you could give any sort of breakdown or examples of where the margin expansion will come from? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Toni, I would say, it comes from a lot of different places and it's hard to put a number on any particular one of them. But, you know, a couple examples. Energy, we've kind of looked at that, as Todd mentioned earlier, still is a little bit of a headwind going forward. So we're not necessarily expecting we'll get a bunch of energy benefit in the second half of the year, but our revenue growth has been really strong and the performance the momentum has been good and that certainly will continue to help in the second half of the year when we grow at real nice levels like we've guided towards and like we've had in the first half of the year, that always helps our ability to drive better margins. But we've talked over the last year or so about important initiatives that we have. Those remain and continue to do well and those are things like our routing improvements through our smart truck initiative. And we have more of those, whether it is sourcing initiatives that Todd touched on in First Aid or others. But those initiatives become very important to us, too. And then there are just some timing of things, maybe some investment in the first half of the year that was really helping propel our growth and continue our momentum. That may not be at the same type of level in the second half of the year. So it's a lot of those different pieces that kind of fall together. And it's, you know, it's hard to put numbers on every single one of those.\nOperator: And at this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Paul for closing remarks.\nPaul Adler: All right. Well thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal '23 financial results in late March and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 second quarter revenue was $2.17 billion compared to $1.92 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 12.8%. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $1 billion compared to $885.1 million last year, an increase of 15.5%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47% for the second quarter of fiscal '23 compared to 46% last year. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a headwind, increasing 10 basis points from last year. Strong volume growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage. Gross margin percentage by business was 47% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services. 50.5% for First Aid and Safety Services. 47.4% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.2% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $444.9 million compared to $381.2 million last year. Fiscal '23 second quarter operating income increased 16.7% and operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 20.5% from 19.8% last year. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.1% compared to 18% last year. The tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the second quarter was $324.3 million compared to $294.7 million last year, an increase of 10.1%. This year's diluted EPS of $3.12 compared to $2.76 last year, an increase of 13%. We had to overcome higher inflation, interest expense and tax rate, therefore we are especially pleased with these financial results. Cash flow remains strong on September 15th, 2022. We declared dividends and pay them on December 15th, 2022 in the amount of $117.4 million in quarterly dividends. To provide our annual -- Todd provided our annual financial guidance related to the guidance. Please note the following. Fiscal '22 included a gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter and a gain on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal '22 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal '23 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.79 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains. Fiscal '23 interest expense is expected to be $113 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal '22 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal '23 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.7%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. Please keep the following in mind when modeling third quarter versus fourth quarter financial results. The number of work days in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal '23 are unchanged from fiscal '22. There are 64 days in the third quarter and 66 days in the fourth. Less work days results in less revenue to cover certain fixed and amortizing costs. In last year's third quarter, First Aid and Safety sold about $15 million in COVID test kits. We don't expect that revenue to repeat this year. Uniform Direct Sale organic revenue growth rates have been very strong year-to-date, however we expect these rates to be pressured in the second half of the fiscal year as the business faces increasingly challenging comparisons. Payroll taxes reset in our fiscal third quarter, increasing our SG&A costs on a sequential basis. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul. Sure, John. This is Mike and we haven't changed our philosophy in terms of capital allocation. We want to continue to invest in the business. And certainly, as we've seen the accelerated growth over the last three quarters, we are investing in the business, but we love M&A and we continue to have all of the discussions to try to keep that pipeline active, but it always takes to come to a decision and we are working those conversations hard and our expectation is that we will be able to continue in the M&A path, but that's we certainly love that option. And certainly, we -- I misspoke a minute ago on dividends. We paid a dividend in September - on September 15th, we paid another one on December 15th, and we certainly have increased the dividend every year we've gone public. We like that option as well and then the buyback continues to be an opportunistic alternative for us when we have excess cash, so no philosophy changes. We're still working all of those in the same way that we have. The only thing I might add is to specifically, Andy, nothing to call out that there is one-time or short-term in nature. It's just that the business is performing very, very well. Manav, I might add, you go back 2.5 years to the pandemic to the beginning of the pandemic. I think we show that we can be pretty nimble when it comes to our cost structure and adapting to changes in the environment. Well, look, we -- what you've seen maybe in the first half of this year is when we grow and we've seen three quarters now straight of double-digit organic growth. So a nice actually four quarters, so a nice acceleration in the performance. And when we grow and the volumes are healthy, we certainly invest in the business and that investment can come through in the way of working capital. And so you see a little bit more working capital usage in our cash flow statement. And that's not necessarily unusual for us when we see an acceleration in the growth rate. But we like our cash flow.

And sometimes there are periods where we are investing maybe a little bit more than in other quarters et cetera. And, you know, Todd's focused on the full year results and the longer term results.

And I don't know that it's anything that we're ready to say is a new norm. It's just simply we look at the year and say we've got some really good incremental margins in that 20% to 30% range that will cause the full year margins to go up. But I wouldn't look at it as a new normal type of a thing. It's just simply there are ebbs and flows within the business and timing of investments, et cetera. Yes, Seth, I'll take that one. We love the Fire business. It's a very attractive business for us, it's the only business we're in where every business legally has to comply with the local laws around it. So the TAM is absolutely massive. And our sales team is doing really well and we're selling into additional customers. We're selling more into our existing customers. We've got a great offering.

            "content": "Thank you, Paul. Second quarter total revenue grew 13.1% to $2.17 billion. Each of our businesses increased revenue at a double-digit rate. The benefits of our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Operating income margin increased 70 basis points to 20.5% and diluted EPS grew 13% to $3.12. I thank our employees whom we call partners for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter of fiscal '23 was $1.71 billion compared to $1.54 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11.3%. Revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. Challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs, businesses continue to turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. Additionally, price increases contributed at a higher level than historically. We believe such a mix of revenue drivers, volume and price is healthy and supportive of continued long-term growth. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the second quarter was $236.0 million compared to $202.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 15.1%. This rate reflects the continued momentum of our First Aid cabinet business, which continues to grow more than 20%. Whether it is COVID-19 or influenza, the health and safety of employees remains top-of-mind. We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in workplace. Personal Protective Equipment or PPE, while still elevated compared to pre-COVID levels, declined slightly on a sequential basis. The revenue mix-shift benefits our financial results because the cabinet service is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins than PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $228.9 million compared to $184.9 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 18.0% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 33.9%. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our second quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.58 billion to $8.67 billion to a range of $8.67 billion to $8.75 billion, a total growth rate of 10.4% to 11.4%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $12.30 to $12.65 to a range of $12.50 to $12.80, a growth rate of 10.8% to 13.5%. Mike? Good morning, Faiza. Thank you for your question. Yes, we, our beat on the revenue side are driven significantly by new business, it's continues to be a very attractive for us. But we are selling more items into our customer base. So it's pretty broad. I mentioned in the prepared comments that pricing is above what our historical experience has been. As you can imagine, due to the experience with inflation that we're seeing across our organization. But it is -- but the primary drivers volume growth and we're benefiting from that. We're investing for that and things are -- we like the trend there. As far as on the margin side, we are committed that we are not going to be solely focused on growing margins because of pricing. In fact, we are dedicated to finding efficiencies in our business, some of that is through revenue leverage just general revenue leverage that we get, but we are focused on finding efficiencies and you mentioned SAP certainly that technology is helping us significantly. We've had -- we've talked about our -- the digitization. Our digital transformation of our business that has been very, very important to us and we're seeing benefits whether it's in our routing efficiencies, productivity of our sales partners, be getting better reuse of our products, in-service inventory because of SAP. Those are all benefits that we're seeing and the marketplace is noticing it and it's helping us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Great. First off, we continue to watch our customer base very closely. We're looking at all of our data to see if there's some trends that we might see if customers are consuming less and what have you. So we're watching that. Now as far as in a recession every recession that I've been -- I've experienced while at Cintas over the last 33 years, we've always sold an attractive amount of new business. And the reason being is, we hope businesses and in an environment, that we help them, position them for success as far as, if they're in the business and they have less people, then somebody still has to take care of certain functions. So we're able to sell value there. If they are in an environment where they're looking to save money, there's in many cases we're able to save them money. It's not that they are. We're always asking for increased spend. It's just redirect the spend to us. And in many cases, we're able to help customers with that instead of spending it with some other vendor or with an outsourced item that they bring it to us. And we can bring efficiencies to them. So we fully expect that we -- our new business will be attractive in any type of economic environment. Certainly, we prefer when the economy is growing robustly, but we'll find ways to be successful in whatever the environment. Yes, thank you, John. I'll speak to it if, Mike, if you'd like to contribute on this subject. But, first off, our retention levels are quite attractive. We very much like where they are. We're focused on making sure that our customer is - it's why we wake up in the morning, is to take care of them, and that focus that culture is pervasive and we're making sure that our partners are positioned to be able to make sure they can take care of them and exceed their expectations. So all that is attractive for us and keep in mind we have a really broad customer base. So we serve over million customers that we see on a very consistent basis. Some are doing some are challenged in the current economic environment, whether they struggle to find people or they're struggling with the wage inflation or inflation in general and then we have other customers that are thriving in this type of environment and frankly we have everything in between. And but generally speaking, what we see are, it's still -- we still like what we see with our customer base. And I think that broad customer base is a real benefit for us. Thank you, George, for the question, and good morning. Again, we have a very broad customer base. And we have a very broad product offering and we're blessed to have both and as a result we're organized in a manner where we're trying to make sure that our customers know everything that we have to offer, they don't always. We've spoken in the past about how going through the pandemic was really, really challenging. One of the positive outputs of that was the fact that our customer base saw the broadness of our offering and in many cases didn't realize we had products and services that we have. So we're focused on that. We're trying to provide more value. When we do that, it is, it helps us because we're -- when we stop our truck and the invoice is larger that's good leverage for us. So we'll provide more value to the customer and we're getting leverage in that manner. So all that's positive. So as far as the sales process being elongated. We're not saying that at this point. And as I mentioned earlier, we are certainly seeing a mix out there. Some customers are struggling and some are doing quite well and everything in-between. But generally speaking the customer base continues to head in a positive manner. Yes, good question, George. So no programmers continues to be a really great opportunity for us. The majority of our new accounts that we sell are in the no programmers section. And so we've been focused on that. We train our partners on that. And those that set of prospects sees value in what we provide. And as a result, the TAM is massive and so that's very exciting for us and we see very nice growth opportunities into the future. Yes, Andy, you're right, the margins are better than historical. The mix shift has been great. We have a -- there's a number of areas where we're able to gain leverage. Certainly the new business is a very nice lever for us. The change in -- I'll call it society and the focus on health and wellness is a real tailwind for us. And so as a result of that cabinet revenue growth is very attractive for us that affects the mix, but we are also finding, I mentioned we've got -- we're finding efficiencies in throughout our business. And First Aid is included in that. And so whether it's routing technology. We've been on SAP and First Aid for a little bit longer, but we're finding efficiencies and we have a very strong supply chain that is finding opportunities to source better and improve our overall operating margins. And Mike, anything you'd like to contribute there? Yes, Andy, good question. We're excited about the gross margin improvement that we're seeing in that business. Despite a 20 basis points headline that we're that we're up against in energy still. So, you're right, the SG&A is up. It's there is we're making investments in the business and appropriately so. Also some G&A medical costs, workers' comp and what have you are higher this quarter and there's always some puts and takes as it relates to that, but we are guiding towards for the whole year in that business, incrementals in the 20% to 30% range and we are, as I mentioned, that margin expansion is going to come in a number of ways, but revenue growth leverage, productivity, which is a broad word, right. There are so many areas where we get productivity improvements and pricing. But, yes, so we're focused on improving the margins there and we'll manage through the G&A investment, the SG&A investment as we move forward. Thanks for the question, Tim, good morning. As far as labor is concerned, the -- I'll call the labor market in totality, easier, but not easy. It is still certainly challenging there. We care passionately about how that looks for our customers and how it impacts our customers. I mentioned some are struggling to staff still and as a result, that affects their business, which impacts us. So but from his standpoint of Cintas and how we're staffed that is not affecting our growth rate, it would be more about how our customers are impacted. I can tell you it wouldn't go well here. If someone said I can't grow as fast as you think I should because I can't staff. We figure that out and we think the environment that we provide for our partners where they have great opportunities and a great wage and benefits and great security and great development is a real advantage for us in the marketplace. So as far as Cintas staffing that is not slowing us up. Certainly, our customers could be impacted by that to some degree. Yes. Wage rates. I don't have an exact number to give you, but we start with the answer and work backwards. And the answer is, we've got to have great people, we've got to have really well-trained and prepared people who can help us be successful and take care of our customers. So is above historical. Yes, it is above historical but nevertheless we're focused on putting the very, very best team out on the field, so that we can take great care of our customers and prepare us for the future of this organization. Yes, Manav, thanks for the question. Yes, we always have anxiety, right. It's part of making sure you're sharp and but nevertheless it is, we do worry about do our, as an economy, do we talk ourselves into pulling back and is that happen to our customer base and does that happen as a ripple effect and but we're not seeing it. We're again, our customer base. It's so broad. Some are doing great. Some are not. But in general we like the direction of our customer base and we in many ways we hope they don't read the press and they stay focused on taking care of their business and investing for the future. And but we'll see what that holds and how the Fed handles things and how that might impact the general economy. Andrew we -- as it relates to the amortization, certainly you've seen the growth that I've talked about a few times and that translates into more garments and other products being injected into our in-service inventory. And we love that. We love when that happens. And so we're seeing growth in the amortization. But we're able to leverage that pretty nicely so far. And you know our business well. We amortize many of those rental products. And so we have good foresight or visibility into what's coming. And that means we can plan, we can source, we can increase prices when necessary. So the visibility gives us a nice advantage in terms of how we think about other ways of operating the business. And as it relates to the second half of the year, look, we don't typically provide guidance on gross margin specifically. But certainly the guidance that we've provided contemplates improvement in our operating margins in the second half of the year and the growth that we have on the top line and all of the other initiatives and things we've got going on. They are performing well and enabling us to do that, to do that margin improvement even in a difficult period of time. Heather, thanks for the question. Yes, so a slight, but still very attractive growth. We like where that is. We're preparing for that. And but we are certainly up against some tougher comps in the back half, specifically with First Aid and Uniform Direct sale. So we'll be lapping those and but we like the growth levels and we find them quite attractive. And that's what we are preparing for. Yes, good question. So again, our customer base is very broad, but I'll tell you this that our verticals where we're investing are, you know, health care, hospitality, education, government are performing quite well and they're growing at an accretive rate to our growth. And we think we choose them wisely and invested in them appropriately. And that customer base is doing well. Within that customer base, again, you get a mix, but nevertheless in general we like that area and it's growing very attractively for us. Kartik, it's a good question. I continue to talk about how broad our customer base is. So you name it, we see it. But the scarcity of employee -- of workers is an issue. Unemployment is still at a very, very low level. There's still, I think, 10 million job openings in the U.S. economy. So as a result of that, you know, people are, I think, careful about how they're handling their employees and being judicious about that. Yes. So we still see energy as a headwind. And when you go to the pump right now, it is certainly a little bit lower than it was a quarter ago. But about 40% of our spend on energy is in natural gas for our production facilities and electric. And that is not heading in the right direction. Natural gas prices are up and electric prices are up. And so but certainly the attention more gets to everybody fills up at the pump for the most part, but not as much focus on natural gas or electric. But we're seeing it and it's I'm sure it's affecting households as well. Shlomo, great question. It really depends upon -- our view of the what the staffing levels of our customers will be. It really depends upon where our relationship is some they'll share with us. Hey, calendar '23, here's what we're thinking. Others, they don't depending upon our relationship levels or their planning level. And so in that case, it's a little bit more reactive. So, you name it, we have that type of experience where it's very transparent and we have a good. We can see around the corner with our expectations there. And then some are just very reactive and we have to see what's going on with their customers. So but generally speaking with add stops, I would say, we see our experiences continues and the patterns that we have in the past. And I mentioned earlier that, I don't know, certainly Q1 speaking of the economy Q1, Q2 was GDP shrunk. Q3 was slightly positive. We'll see what Q4. holds in store for GDP. It's tough to tell, if we're in a technical recession or if we're not and what calendar '23 holds in store for us. But the employment situation in the U.S. is still tough to get people and as I mentioned there's 10 million job openings. We'll see if that continues to decline. But we're trying to make sure that we're positioned to grow and but as Mike mentioned, if the economy affects our customer base in a very negative manner, we'll be prepared to pivot and manage our cost structure appropriately and we're planning on being successful in whatever the economic environment brings to us. Shlomo, as I mentioned, in our prepared remarks, pricing is -- has always been a component of our growth. Same is the - what we went through with some serious economic turbulence with COVID-19 and what have you. So that being said, we're planning on growing our business most attractively through volume growth and getting leverage there and planning on growing margins via leverage on that revenue growth and finding efficiencies in our business. That being said, it's a very competitive environment. And as we talk to our customers, they certainly challenge us. And they want us to find efficiencies in our business and not just pass along cost to them and that's what we're focused on. Yes, Scott. I'll start, Mike, if you want to contribute on this subject there. As far as the market, the competitive market. We sell a lot of no programmers. Certainly we do take business from our competitors, but that's, we find that there are so many businesses out there that say, wow, I didn't realize that you would serve a business of my size or I didn't realize you had those types of products and services and they see great value in what we do and so we're very focused on that. As far as the customer base, the larger customers, some of them are struggling, smaller ones are certainly some of them are struggling, but I would say, generally speaking, the smaller ones are probably a little under a little bit more pressure just because it's tough to attract retain staff, pay people and at the levels that you have to be competitive in the marketplace. So that's kind of a generalization that may not be completely fair and I could give you plenty of examples of smaller businesses that are thriving. But that's kind of a generalization I thought I might share with you. Sure. Good question. Very broad based. It's not one customer or a couple customers. It's very broad based. And when you think about that, that area, certainly hospitality is a big component of it, but there's other customers that are national and scope type customers. But hospitality specifically I'll speak to, yes, they're struggling to staff, but there's a lot of demand out there in the hospitality sector. And as a result they need help. And you know and when you think of that, when they're struggling to staff and they have to provide products and services, we've become a very attractive opportunity for them to sole source and to provide products that they can get quickly and that are very attractive and allow them to provide the proper guest experience that they want to provide for their patrons. Yes, Toni, good question. As we think about pricing in the future, it certainly is above historical today. It's tough to predict what inflation holds in the future. But presuming that comes down, I'd say you'd see us closer to historical from a price adjustments. But it really depends upon what happens with the Fed, what happens with the economy, what happens with wage pressures are so many inputs. And that one's tough to predict. So but we're watching it very closely."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Cintas First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Adler, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Pardon me, interruption, Mr. Adler, we're unable to hear you.\nPaul Adler: Thank you. Yes, we were still on mute. So, thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2023 first quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Paul. We are pleased with our start to our fiscal year 2023. First quarter total revenue grew 14.2%. Each of our businesses increased revenue at a double-digit rate. The benefits of our strong revenue growth flow through to our bottom line. Excluding a one-time gain recorded in last year's first quarter selling and administrative expenses, operating income margin increased 20 basis points and EPS grew 12.3%. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. In challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs, businesses continue to turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Turning now to our business units. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 was $1.70 billion compared to $1.51 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 12.3%. Revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Additionally, price increases contributed at a higher level than historically. We believe such a mix of revenue drivers volume versus price is healthy and supportive of continued long-term growth. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $234.2 million compared to $199.1 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 15.8%. This rate reflects the continued momentum of our First Aid cabinet business, which continues to grow more than 20%. Personal protective equipment or PPE, while still elevated compared to pre-COVID levels declined again on a sequential basis. We welcome this mix shift because the cabinet service is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins in PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $234.5 million compared to $189.7 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 17.4% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 44.1%. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide additional details on our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.47 billion to $8.58 billion to a range of $8.58 billion to $8.67 billion. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $11.90 to $12.30 to a range of $12.30 to $12.65. Mike?\nMike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 first quarter revenue was $2.17 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 13.9%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 was $1.03 billion compared to $902.8 million last year, an increase of 13.9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.5% for the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 compared to 47.6% last year. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a headwind increasing 30 basis points from last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.5% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 49.6% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.3% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $440.1 million compared to $394.1 million last year. Excluding last year's first quarter gain totaling $12.1 million and recorded in selling and administrative expenses, fiscal '23 first quarter operating income increased 15.2% and operating income margin increased 20 basis points to 20.3% from 20.1% last year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 14.8% compared to 11% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the first quarter was $351.7 million compared to $331.2 million last year. Last year's first quarter diluted EPS contained $0.09 from the previously mentioned gain and related income tax expense. Excluding the gain and the related income tax expense, this year's diluted EPS of $3.39 compared to $3.02 last year, an increase of 12.3%. First quarter operating cash flow increased 13.8%. On June 15, 2022, we paid shareholders $97.7 million in quarterly dividends. Also during the quarter, we purchased $210.8 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder return. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to do so consistently. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal '22 included not only the gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter, but also a gain on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal '22 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal '23 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.76 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal \u201922 after excluding the gains. Fiscal \u201823 interest expense is expected to be approximately $110 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal '22 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal \u201923 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal \u201922 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. The expected higher effective tax rate will negatively impact fiscal '23 diluted EPS by approximately $0.32 and diluted EPS growth by approximately 290 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul.\nPaul Adler: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just comment on the new business trend, specifically around signing up new customers. Have you seen any changes there? And any signs of elongations of sales cycle, particularly for larger customers? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Ashish. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. Yeah, our new business is quite robust. We continue to be very successful in converting over no programmers into our programs in all of our businesses with the exception of fire, which obviously \u2013 they were all -- everyone's a programmer in that business, but we're having really good success there. And we look at the total addressable market and it's still incredibly large and growing. So that's exciting for us. But as far as the sales cycle, I haven't seen anything that would lead me to believe that the sales cycle is elongating. We've got really good momentum in our new business. I'm very encouraged by that. And as we've spoken about in the past, some of our investments that we have made are really paying off big in the form of some of our unique products in our rental line with our Carhartt products, our Chef Works and we've got a CareFlex line of scrubs through land out that's really successful in our unique restroom lines. And then our First Aid business, just the breadth of products that we're offering is really helping us get in the door and provide great products and services to our customers. They're also seeing our investments and technology that we've made, whether it's our garment tracking that is giving us a real advantage in the marketplace, our garment dispensing that we've seen. And I've spoken about our myCintas portal, which is unique and advantage in the marketplace. It makes it easier to do business with us and that's important for our customers and gives our sales partners confidence in walking in the door. So some really good things in -- heading in that direction.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color and obviously great to see that strong momentum in the top line. Maybe just on the margins, the question around energy looks like, oil prices might be rolling-off here or at least the fuel prices may be rolling-off, but the natural gas prices are going up. How should we think about those puts and takes on the energy front for the rest of the year? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. So when you think about our energy spend, certainly, it's up over where we were a year over prior. It's down 10 basis points sequentially. Trying to anticipate exactly where that's going to head is challenging. Certainly, but I can tell you this, we are focused on efficiencies that we can drive in our business that will lower our needs for natural gas and lower our needs for gas at the pump. and we're leveraging those and that's helping us. That helps us with our CO2 emissions and it helps us with our efficiencies in our business and our spend. And we're confident we can continue to make strides there. So that's where exactly natural gas prices will go this winter, what's going on in Europe and other areas. It's tough to tell for sure, but we'll manage through it and we see opportunities to improve in our business and we're leveraging that.\nMike Hansen: Ashish, I might add that right around 60% of our energy spend is the gas, or -- gas and diesel and the remainder is electricity and natural gas. So the natural gas is a smaller component of that energy spend. More of it is the price of the pump, which as you suggested, is coming down.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. Thanks again.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. In the quarter, approximately what percentage of new business growth came from the no programmer market?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, George. This is Todd. The majority of our accounts are -- come from no programmers. So that is -- that trend has been consistent over the years and continues. And in a marketplace where it's still difficult for employers to find people to work, offering a value of this and the way we handle it with uniforms is attractive for them. So it's another benefit for customers and they see that as an opportunity to attract their employees and retain their employees and we have one heck of an offering when it comes to that, that makes it really attractive for people. So I'd say those trends continue as they have in the past.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Can you provide an update on uniform demand trends from the healthcare vertical?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, certainly. So the healthcare vertical is a very attractive vertical for us. It's growing nicely. Demographics are such in the United States and Canada that demand will continue. And we're seeing -- we have some unique offerings in that area with garment dispensing and our unique scrub line that makes it attractive. There's certainly other items that are -- that we rent into the healthcare market, whether it be an acute or non-acute. But we really like what we're seeing there from that demand. And I'll give you one example of a hospital that about six months ago, we sold a scrub rental program into that account. And it was a nice -- very nice sized customer that you would recognize a name. In that case, the nurses that we were providing the program to, they were wandering the products at home and the nurses voiced a concern about safety. Meaning, hey, what am I taking home? Am I wandering it? Am I wandering it correctly? And in that case, they chose Cintas because of a few things. One is, our technology that we've deployed that's unique that allows us to manage inventory for them, which provides the requisite access to the product, which is really, really important. And also helps control their costs based upon how we manage that inventory. But also improves the safety aspect of it, so separate from being an employee benefit, because those what I'll call potentially contaminated goods or scrubs. They don't go home. We laundry them appropriately via our hygienic process, hygienically cleaning process, which allows them to have the confidence that their process correctly and when that it's improved safety. And just as an anecdote, I mentioned that was about six months ago, just recently, we sold a microfiber wipe rental program to that same hospital. And so they use microfiber wipes in many ways, but the most obvious one is when they're cleaning guest rooms or patient rooms, we should say. In this case, that particular hospital they were purchasing those wipes and then they're having the, I'll call them hospital employees or EBS type folks that were cleaning those on their on-premise laundry. And in that case, they chose Cintas because it was able to -- we were able to reduce their labor costs. They're having trouble getting access to labor. And then again, we're processing those in a manner where they can have great confidence that they're processed correctly with a hygienically clean process. So you asked your original question, George, was about uniform demand in hospitals, which is quite good. But it also, there's so much that we can provide to those hospitals. And I just want to give one example to just give a little color around that.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: I will now take our next question from Andy Wittmann of Baird. Please go ahead.\nAndy Wittmann: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Mike, I just wanted to talk a little bit about what is implied in the guidance here. Maybe couple of different ways to think about that. But how much conservativism is baked into the guidance? And I made a couple of comments in the prepared remarks. Is there any change maybe sequentially to the guidance the way you're factoring in the macro outlook? And maybe any leading indicators that you can give us -- that gives us confidence that the economy is performing at the rate that you think it is?\nMike Hansen: Well, so let me start, Andy, with the guidance. The guidance implies and we're 60 days past when we gave the initial guidance. The guidance implies really good growth through the rest of the year. But as you know, we do face some tougher comps as we saw the business pick up last year throughout the year. And so we would expect a little bit of deceleration from the growth levels of where we are, but still healthy growth and ending the year in a range of 9% to over 10%. And we like the momentum of the business today and our expectation right now is that we're not seeing any change in the value that our customers are seeing and we're not changing -- we're not seeing any change in the way in the economy, I'll say. Now -- maybe I'll flip to margins briefly. Our margin expectation remains that we will see margin improvement during the year and that range that we provided certainly contemplates that margin improvement even in a pretty challenging type of economic environment. So the guidance is a little bit better than we gave 60 days ago, part -- because of the first quarter, part because of the momentum that we see in the business. Now as it relates to -- trying to dissect what the economic picture is going to look like for the rest of the year, look, that can be pretty difficult, right? I mean, there are -- some who say we may be in a recession today. There are some who say we may be in a recession early \u201823. Some who say, we may be in a recession late in \u201823. The Fed has come out and said GDP for \u201823 is going to be 1.2%. It's hard to predict what we're going to see in the economic picture as we move forward. But what we know is that the momentum in our business today is really good. The value proposition that our customers see and our prospects see, they're reacting very positively to it. And because of that and many other factors, we believe that momentum can continue along with healthy margins. And that's what we've given you in our guidance. Does that help answer that question a bit?\nAndy Wittmann: It does. Thank you for that. I guess, I wanted to -- then follow-up with a question on, I guess, overall customer retention levels. Considering that you're getting above historical averages in price increases, I thought maybe it would be helpful to comment on that. And you guys have talked about the sales momentum in a couple of different ways, but if you look at sales productivity on a per head basis, is that metric up on a year-over-year basis as well?\nTodd Schneider: Andy, thanks for the question. This is Todd. First off on retention, yeah, retention is very good. We like where that is. We like the momentum around that. We're organizing around it appropriately to make sure that we're meeting and exceeding our customers' demands. And we like our -- the product and service offering that we have and the customers find it attractive. I mentioned some of the products and the technology that we have that are unique and the customers like it. I think they also like our approach that we took over the past couple of years about being really flexible and empathetic with them as they were going through, -- what they went through the various businesses through calendar '21 and calendar '22, -- '20and '21, I should say, with the pandemic. So I think that was -- that is benefiting us because they saw that we were -- we understood what they were challenged with and we pivoted to provide them what they needed instead of just telling them, hey, here's what you contracted to buy. So I think all that is paying off. As far as productivity in new business, yeah, we like it. It's up and we are -- certainly, we love our sales force. We think they're well trained, well positioned when sales partners have confidence in the products and the technology and the services that they're going to provide, that confidence is powerful and it's showing itself in productivity and we like that. We're also deploying up (ph) types of technology, via our investment with SAP, that's paying off in a number of ways. I'll just give you one as it relates to sales, which is investing in technology that allows for what I'll call best next prospect for a sales partner. Meaning instead of just calling blindly on businesses, we want to drive to our sales team who will be the next best prospect to call, which through analytics, we can tell them where to spend their time. And that's better for the partner, that's better for our company, again that provides more confidence. And yeah, so those types of investments are paying dividends for us.\nAndy Wittmann: Great. Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: We can now take our next question from Tim Mulrooney of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nTim Mulrooney: Yes. Good morning. We know energy was a slight headwind to margins in the quarter relative to last year, but gross margins were only down 10 basis points. So I was curious, how some of the other cost buckets are trending? How are labor costs trending? Were those a headwind or a tailwind to margins? And anything else big to point out here like maybe materials and supplies?\nMike Hansen: Tim, maybe I'll start on that. From a gross margin perspective, you're right. We're down 10 basis points from last year in a period where total energy expenses are up 30 basis points. We're up 190 basis points sequentially and so we've seen some nice improvement there. And look, when you think about that rental number of 47.5% that's a really good gross margin for us. We've only been higher than that a few times and that certainly is a much greater gross margin than we saw pre-pandemic. So we like the -- where we are in that space. We like the sequential improvement in the gross margin, which is pretty good. And we're doing it while we have -- we've seen such good growth in volume over the course of the last year and we're able to be pretty flat overall in gross margins while we're investing in the business. So in other words, that volume growth over the last 12 months has, we certainly created the need for additional capacity, particularly in our laundry facilities and we're investing as we should because we certainly want to make sure we have the capacity to serve the customer. And so nothing -- I would say nothing unusual to point out in there other than we continue to make the progress that we want to make. The only other thing I might say about that gross margin is, we're seeing an all-time high in our First Aid and Safety business. And we continue to like the way that business is trending and the mix back towards that First Aid business that we love so much. Todd mentioned that the First Aid part of that business is over 20% growth still. And we've seen some really nice movement there. So again, nothing real specific to point out other than making good sequential progress and certainly continuing to invest for our future growth.\nTim Mulrooney: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I guess my follow-up will just stick on that point. The First Aid and Safety gross margin really stuck out to me in the quarter. I mean, you're almost at 50% gross margin in that business, well above what we normally see there. Are there any extraordinary items to call out there that help drive those strong results that wouldn't necessarily repeat moving forward? Just trying to understand how to think about gross margins in First Aid moving forward as we model out the business for the rest of the year?\nTodd Schneider: Sure. Tim, it's Todd. We're proud of the gross margin improvement that we've made in the First Aid business. It is reflective certainly of the shift of the mix of the business. But I wouldn't say that there's anything that is out of the ordinary, where you'd say, oh, my goodness. Is there something that a one timer? So, no. Now that being said, we're -- certainly there will be puts and takes of the First Aid business gross margin throughout the year, don't think of it as a linear progression upward. It's -- we're making investments. We're growing that business really attractively. We are certainly leveraging -- trying to leverage as very much as best we can. The revenue growth that we're getting, but we've got to -- we've -- as Mike pointed out in all of our businesses, we've got to invest to meet the demand. And we're doing exactly that and trying to do it as intelligently and as efficiently as possible. But we're really happy with the demand levels that we're seeing and make sure we're positioned to meet those demand levels.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, guys and congrats on a nice quarter.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Tim.\nMike Hansen: Thank you.\nOperator: We can now take our next question from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I can appreciate, obviously, all the trends are very strong today. As you said, no economic weakness you're seeing in your businesses, but maybe you can help us with typically if that does start impacting your customers, like, how quickly do you see it, how quickly do they react? And I guess what do you do in response to that?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. So Manav, good question. We are not seeing it in our customer base today. And as a reminder, -- as of Friday, there'll be four months into our fiscal year. And will we see it how well -- what's this recession? Are we in one, as Mike said, is there one coming in the first half of '23, the back half? We're not trying to predict all that, but we are staying acutely aware, but we're positioning ourselves to make sure that we can grow in all types of economic cycles. And as a reminder, we've grown in 51 out of the last 53 years. The only exception being the great recession. We certainly hope that any recession that comes is not as severe as what that was. And so what I'll call in, whatever the traditional type of recession, if that comes, then we expect good performance. We expect to grow. We have traditionally grown in multiples of GDP and jobs growth in the past. Mike spoke of our products and services are highly valued. You think about cleanliness, safety, image and compliance. Those are buying motors that are stronger today than they were in the past, certainly stronger than what they were even pre-pandemic. Our products and services are more diversified today. Our customer base is more diversified today than it was in the past. Today, we're 70% services and 30% goods producing. So that diversification we think will help us. And when you think about NAICS codes, we have no three digit NAICS codes that is greater than 10%. So again, a really nice diversification there. We have also invested as we've talked about in the past calls in our vertical sales approach which we think gives nice diversification into when you think about government and you think about healthcare, higher education, those types. We've spoken about our momentum that we think is really, really good. And also our strong cash flow, we think that will allow us to be opportunistic as we -- whenever we are into a recession if that is today or in the future, we're going to be well positioned to make sure we're successful.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe Mike, if you could just remind us of your mix on the debt side between fixed and floating, whether you hedge just as we track these interest rate increases?\nMike Hansen: Sure. We have -- as of the end of August, Manav, we've got about $500 million in commercial paper or other short term variable debt. And the rest of our debt is fixed or senior notes. We do have some of our 27 maturities the interest rates locked on those. Those are right now, as you can imagine, a fair amount in the money So that's where we are today and look that the -- we like that, we like a little bit of that short-term debt because it gives us optionality. We can pay that down if we feel like we want to or we can certainly have more space to use that if we needed to.\nManav Patnaik: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. It\u2019s Andrew. I just wanted to get a quick thoughts from you about organic revenue growth for the balance of the year from kind of each First Aid, Fire, Uniform Direct. Those had particularly strong first quarters. I definitely heard your general comments about tougher comps. And like, do you think each of these three should be double-digit organic growers this year?\nTodd Schneider: Andrew, thank you for the question. When I think about each of our businesses, we don't give guidance based upon each of them individually, but I'll just provide some maybe some top line thoughts. I'm really -- I haven't done the calculus on what it would be for the year, but I'm just thinking about Qs two through four for each. I would think about from rental, Fire and the First Aid business all being high-single digits of the balance of the year. Keeping in mind that there was some PPE in the First Aid business in Q3 which will provide a tougher comp for sure. And then in our Uniform Direct Sale business, we're going to be up against much tougher comps. So I would think of that from high-single to flat, maybe even negative in Q4 based upon the significant comps that we're up against there, which is obviously a little bit more lumpy business.\nAndrew Steinerman: Just say that last part again about Uniform Direct Sale, high-single digit. And then you said flat, just -- you were talking about two through four. So just say the last part again about Uniform Direct Sale.\nTodd Schneider: Yes. So when you think about Uniform Direct Sale business, again, a lumpier business, high single to -- from Q2 through Q4. Think about high-singles down to closer to flat to maybe even negative in Q4, due to sales growth due to the significant comps that will be up against on the back half of the year.\nAndrew Steinerman: Makes sense. Thank you so much.\nTodd Schneider: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I guess, I'm curious, like what has gone better than what you expected, when you first gave the guide a couple of months ago, especially as it relates to revenues. I know you mentioned better pricing and I'm curious if the pricing update has been better than expected or is that better new business? I know you mentioned the healthcare vertical in particular. So just more perspective on like what you think really drove the outperformance, specifically in the rental business?\nTodd Schneider: Great. Faiza, thanks for the question. It's Todd. I'll start if Mike you want to chime in. There's many contributing inputs to our positive growth that we're seeing. New business is quite good as we spoke about, but retention and penetration is very attractive as well. We continue to improve upon our cross sell. And as you mentioned, pricing is certainly playing a larger role than it did historically, as it should because of the levels of cost increase that we are seeing via whether it's labor or material cost and what have you. So I think just generally speaking, we like the key inputs that we're seeing. I mentioned earlier our diversification into those various businesses, verticals, et cetera., they're all -- we like the momentum we're seeing in all those, so pretty widespread.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the labor environment. I don't know if you're seeing some easing in the environment in your business at this point. And I'm curious how you think about that going forward sort of, is that as a labor environment eases, is that a benefit for you? Or is that maybe more of a headwind from a competitive perspective?\nTodd Schneider: Good question on labor. I'd say, easing a bit, but that's relative. It is still a very challenging environment. But maybe not as quite as challenging as it was six months ago, eight months ago, but still quite challenging. And we are in constant pursuit of a tracking and retaining the very, very best people. We think that gives us competitive advantage in the marketplace. So when we look out and say, okay, what does that mean to us? We're constantly in pursuit of that. So any easing of the labor market would certainly be welcome from a standpoint of making a little bit easier to run at lower RPMs. But here's what I know is we -- our team figures it out and they have -- they are staffed at the appropriate levels to meet our customers' demand. They've done one heck of a job in fighting through all these challenges over the past couple of years to make sure that we're positioned to be successful. So whatever the environment, our team will figure it out. We've shown that they'll be in the past. We\u2019ll pivot appropriately, but -- so we'll manage through it.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you so much.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Heather Balsky of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. On the new customer growth front, could -- you already touched on healthcare earlier in the Q&A, but where else are you seeing some of the momentum? Are there additional verticals where you're seeing outside growth or you're targeting verticals you haven't been in the past? It'd be great to get color on that. Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Heather, thanks for the question. Again, our experience is very broad in our successes that we're seeing. I'll just give you one another example that might provide a little color. In one of our verticals, where we're calling on the government sector. There's one particular city that I won't mention, but you'll know the name of it. About a year ago, we sold a uniform program into that city. And as an example there, that was into the sanitation, transportation, parts and recreation type departments. And in that case, they were using a local provider before we took over that account. And they chose us in that case because they liked our garment offering was better, meaning they thought we had better, more attractive garments that their employees wanted to wear. Our garment tracking technology help them to reduce costs, meaning less lost garments and what have you. And then as I mentioned earlier, our investment into our My Cintas web portal makes it may be easier for them to do business with us. So which reduces their administrative time and just helpful for them. So that was about a year ago and then, If you fast forward just recently, we sold them a First Aid cabinet service to all those departments and even more municipal buildings. And in that case, previously they had ordered all their first aid products online. So they were a no programmer. They were ordering it from whomever online and then they were essentially doing all that work and filling those candidates themselves. Inquisidentally, the sales lead for that opportunity came from our uniform service provider. So while they're the uniform service provider was speaking to the customer and they said, hey, we need help here. So the uniform service provider pass it on to our -- the appropriate person in our First Aid service provider. In that case, they chose us because, again, a better management of the products and we're able to help them manage the products better, improve their compliance, reduce their costs and remove their need to administer the program. So you think about what businesses are challenged with. In this case, it was a city government, but it's still, they're still running it as a business where they have to meet their customers' demands and their employees' demands. And I think another example of just how we are growing our business and why it's attractive for businesses, sticky, good retention, good cross sell and that shows itself in new business. Hopefully that color helps a little bit.\nHeather Balsky: Yeah. Thank you for that. And then just a question on pricing. Can you just walk us through where you are in the process of taking, I guess, this outsized pricing you've been taking? When did it start? Kind of when do you start to anniversary it? Just trying to think through the flow through as we progress over the next few quarters.\nTodd Schneider: Well, Heather, pricing is a local subject. It's a customer by customer subject. Meaning some businesses are doing better than others. And -- but as we look at that, when inflation kicked in to much higher degrees than that required us to make sure that our price adjustments were higher than historical as well. So you can think of about it that way when inflation was -- went to above historical levels. That's when we adjust to pricing at above historical levels. And as far as what that means moving forward, that will depend upon the -- what inflation does moving forward. So I don't have a crystal ball as it applies to that or a recession what have you, but we're paying very, very close attention to all those inputs and we'll manage it appropriately.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Seth Weber of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Weber: Hi, guys. Good morning. I actually had a pricing question as well, kind of a similar question. So, Todd, I guess I'm trying to understand if how much of the price increases that you guys have been pushing through are just purely tied to inflation and how much of it is, since I was just trying to get more for the value prop that you're off offering today? So I'm trying to understand, will pricing revert back to its traditional level if inflation receives? Or do you think that pricing can be structurally higher for Cintas just based on the greater value that you're offering to your customers kind of today versus history, that makes sense?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Seth. It's a fair question. As I think about our customer base, we're such a broad customer base. So some of them, we have contractual commitments, some of them we have the ability to adjust prices closer to inflation and what have you. So it's very, very broad and it really depends on the particular customer and the health of that customer as well. But here's what I can tell you is that we take a long term approach. We don't think about our customers and quarters or fiscal years, we think about them in over decades. And that approach has really paid-off big dividends for us. Now, we are constantly trying to improve the value that we provide to our customers. That being said, when inflation is at the levels it's at, it requires us to adjust prices at above historical. When inflation comes back down and we certainly hope and expect that that will occur. Then I think you can think of our price adjustments to be back closer to more historical. We're now -- am I constantly trying to improve the value to our customers? Absolutely. That pursuit will be in perpetuity and the marketplace determines how that pricing is handled appropriately.\nMike Hansen: Seth, I might add two things. One, you bring up kind of the structure of our pricing and we're generally the highest price relative to our competition in the space. So in other words, we don't leave with price generally. We believe that our products, our service, they are better and that generally means we are at higher price points than our competition. And I don't expect that that would change. As Todd said, we are continuing to look for ways of even improving that value more in the future. But I don't see that type of pricing changing because of the inflation going up and down. We believe that we can command the best prices because our products are better like, car hard and other products like that and our service is just better. The other thing I might add is, our pricing is, as Todd said is customer by customer and local and it's not necessarily a -- we have to offset or we look to offset inflation immediately. Generally speaking, we want to do the best for our customers and continue to add the right value, but we also know that given the way our cost structure works, we don't have to necessarily immediately offset inflation. We get, for example, the products that we rent in our rental business, we get to amortize them, right? And so if we do have to take a cost increase, we get -- we certainly get visibility before that hits our P&L because that has to go through the manufacturing process, then it gets to our locations and then it amortizes over a period of time. And so we can have multiple price increases before that hits our P&L. And that ability to anticipate and manage our cost structure as well as our pricing, it's reflected in the fact that even in this pretty darn difficult environment, we've been able to increase our margins year-over-year, certainly, excluding those one-time gains, but we've been able to continue to increase our margins during that period of time. So I just give you that color to say, we are very thoughtful about the way we price and we are thoughtful about the way we anticipate the costs within our cost structure. And it works because we're able to increase our margins in a pretty difficult inflationary environment in each of the last four quarters.\nSeth Weber: Yeah. No, it makes total sense, Mike. I appreciate it guys. That's super helpful and that's really all I had today. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. It's pretty noticeable that the cost of goods sold is up only like $10 million sequentially. But when I look at the SG&A, it's up like $46 million. And usually when you have some kind of inflationary prices, I would have thought it'd hit the COGS more. Maybe you could explain to us what the changes were in SG&A and was there some kind of significant investments in production or anything like that? And maybe if you can bring it down to kind of the unit level?\nMike Hansen: Well, Shlomo, I'll speak to the SG&A piece of this. Yes, we did have some sequential increase. But Shlomo, if you look at going back to -- I've got going back to fiscal \u201815. Our first quarter SG&A is usually the highest of the year. I'll throw out the pandemic impact a year. But our first quarter is usually the highest SG&A quarter of the year and that's been consistent for a number of years. And that's simply because of some things like, we have higher payroll taxes when our equity compensation vest at that period of time. It usually happens in the first quarter. We tend to have a little bit more stock options that create more payroll taxes. We tend to have some beginning of the year meetings and other things that happen. But year-over-year, if you pull that gain out that we've been talking about, our SG&A is down 40 basis points. And so we like -- we do like the movement of that SG&A. And gosh, if you go back to pre-pandemic Q1 of 2020, we're down almost 300 basis points. If you go back to 2019\u2019s SG&A were down 260 basis points. My point Shlomo is, this is not unusual for us to have a first quarter higher SG&A because of just the way that our business works and the timing. But year-over-year, we continue to make really good performance in that. And in this case, down 40 basis points.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe you can also talk about the higher revenue kind of translated into margin for two of the units, but for kind of the other unit, it didn't look like it's translating exactly the same way. Is there something that was -- is there a mix item in terms of what was being sold over there? And then just maybe you can just touch on your expectation for cash flow through the year with such strong revenue should we expect there to be a working capital drag. So we wouldn't necessarily see revenue grow the same way that we would see earnings grow.\nMike Hansen: Shlomo, I'll talk to the All Other first. I'm not sure, if you're talking year-over-year that gain that we've referred to a number of times is in the All Other. And so you have to make sure that you're stripping out that gain 14.7% for the quarter for us that is a pretty good quarter. But as Todd mentioned a little bit ago, that Uniform Direct Sale piece that can tend to move up and down a bit and be more inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter and that's a bit of what we've seen in this quarter. So once you pull out the gain from last year where we had that outsized operating margin in All Other. We're at a pretty good spot at 14.7% and it more than anything is attributable to that lumpiness in the Uniform Direct sale business. As it relates to our cash flow, look, we like where the cash flow is where our operating cash flow is up 13.7% year-over-year. Free cash flow is up 7%. And look from quarter-to-quarter, there can be puts and takes. But generally speaking, our cash flow is really good and I expect that we'll see a continued very good conversion from net income to operating cash flow. Now, when we grow and we've been growing quite nicely, we have always been a bit of a drag in working capital because our AR tends to go up as we grow. Our uniforms in service and other items in service tends to grow -- go up as we grow and that certainly has happened. But we're still turning that into really good cash flow and I would expect that that's going to continue for the rest of the year. We're going to probably be a little bit higher in CapEx during this fiscal \u201823 year because we've -- again, we've kind of come from a pandemic period where we didn't need to grow capacity and we've really seen some nice growth over the course of the last -- more than fiscal year. And that certainly means we do some investing. And so you're going to see a little bit of an increase in CapEx, but right in the range where we've guided to that 3% to 3.5% of revenue.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks very much. Good morning, guys. I mean, kind of go back to the recession question and the essence of the question is going to be visibility. It's been asked a few times on the call, but your guidance, your quarter is obviously quite strong. The guidance is certainly ambitious. And I view you guy has generally pretty conservative. So things must look really good to you right now and through the end of the fiscal year. So no one have kind of asked this, but I want to delve in a little bit deeper. When do you see when you're working with your customer or something like going back to past recessions. What are the first signs you see? How do they manifest? And what type of visibility do you have into OOK (ph) that's going to affect our numbers, weeks, months, quarters later. If you could just tell us kind of going back to pass through session, how that takes shape? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Scott, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Mike, certainly if you want to chime in. When we think about, again, are we in a recession technical? It's one coming in early '23, late '23 how severe we don't know those items, but we are watching it very closely. When you think about our customer base, how might it show up? We'll customers if their demand is being impacted then they're going to look for ways to cut their costs. Is that in getting a no look at their P&L and say, okay, what's the biggest things I can move on? And frankly, we're not usually top of their list. So -- and the reason being is because our spend per customer is pretty small. But that being said, we'll -- will they reduce their needs for certain services, reduce quantities of products that they need. Certainly those types of things can happen if their demand is being impacted. So those are the items that we look for is, our customers reducing their needs because their demand of their business is such that they don't need as much. So I'd say that would be one of the certainly bigger categories that we look for. Mike, any other thoughts, but those are the first one that came in mind.\nMike Hansen: Yeah, I think that's true. We may see some of those kinds of signs. We may see a couple of our customers go out of business depending on the type of recession. But the other thing that I think is really important is we've grown through lots of recessions in the last 50 years. And we have also sold a lot of new business through every recession. And so even if we start to see some signs that the customers are paying a little bit more attention to their spending. We know this that we're not asking them generally to spend new money. It's spend it with us and we will help them with our programs to reduce their own work content. In other words, they can -- they find their people can do more with less because we're able to take some work away from them and we're not necessarily asking them to spend new dollars. So we -- look, we're going to be paying attention to all different kinds of things within the economy, but we know this. We're going to sell a lot of new business. We're going to sell the no programmers. We're going to help our customers reduce their own work content. And that's why we feel, we not only do, we love the momentum that we have, but as we look forward, that value proposition is still resonating very, very well. We've said that a number of times and we don't see that changing And so we feel pretty good and we generally -- our guidance is a reflection of that and we like where we're headed.\nScott Schneeberger: Excellent. Thanks guys. That sounds good. I think a good follow on there. You've alluded to M&A, but we haven't really discussed it on this call. How is the environment right now? Are you seeing more opportunities or is that pretty steady? Any commentary on multiples? Is that something that's what more attractive, less attractive? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Scott. This is Todd. Our deal flow is good. We love our balance sheet, who love our position in the marketplace. That being said, those M&A type of opportunities, they -- tough to pay some, toughed there are various items that cause things to flip the switch for someone to sell their business. But I can tell you this, we're really well positioned. Love our balance sheet, love our team and the ability to manage through any M&A. And we think that that's going to be an opportunity for us in the future and we're well positioned for it. That being said, again, it's tough to pace them, but deal flow looks good and I don't see anything that's all that different from a multiple standpoint in the marketplace. So we're interested in any and all opportunities from an M&A standpoint and we'll continue to push for those.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks, Todd. Excellent. I'll turn it over.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: We can now take our final question from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks. I wanted to ask a longer term margin question. If I look back about two years ago, your EBITDA margin like really meaningfully stepped up to mid-20s. But at the beginning, I think you're benefiting from travel, reduced travel during the pandemic and healthcare costs. You've really been able to keep it at that level. And I know you talked about adjusting your cost structure at the beginning of the pandemic, but basically what type of expenses have you been able to adjust so that you can stay at this mid-20s EBITDA level. Just how sustainable is it? It seems like it is, but wanted to just get some additional color there.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Tony. It's Todd, you're absolutely correct. And when we look forward, we see incremental margins. We've talked about 20% to 30% and we see that in our future. And we are leveraging certainly the top line very nicely. We manage our variable costs. I think quite well, the team is very, very good at that. But we're also getting efficiencies from some of our digital transformation that we've talked about in the past. You see that certainly energy is a big subject today, but we've talked about our Smart Truck proprietary routing technology that's helping us reduce idle time and drive time, which obviously helps with energy spend, but it helps with CO2 emissions as well. And one of the things, we talk about around here is that we don't make money when the wheels are moving on our trucks. So getting those efficiencies is very important. We're extracting other efficiencies via our investment with SAP, with our inventory control programs that are allowing us to get better reuse of our products in our stockrooms, which also helps improve turnaround time for our customers. We think it's very, very important which gives us an advantage in the marketplace. I mentioned in our last call, we have an operational excellence dashboard that provides us better transparency into the efficiency levels at each of our production facilities. So that is significant, right? So we're able to understand the efficiency levels of our facilities not by having to be there in person every day, but by understanding the metrics of our operational excellence dashboard in real time. So I guess it's a blessing that we have those opportunities to improve. It's frustrating that we have opportunities to improve, but we're focused on improving those and extracting those efficiencies. So that will allow us to continue to provide good incremental margins separate from the items that I mentioned before with some of the other technologies that we deployed with making it a better win for customers and how they're doing business with us. So yeah, as we look forward, we're going to continue to those efficiencies and provide what we think are attractive incremental margins.\nToni Kaplan: Great. And on a more sort of current basis, any changes to contract structure, changes in contract lengths, any increasing the minimum thresholds for clients, anything to call out there?\nTodd Schneider: Tony, I would say, it's nothing out of the ordinary, certainly, we take a very long term approach with our customers. They take a long term approach with us and we make sure that, that we're positioned to meet their needs and exceed them and provide products and services that they really value. And so that's what we're doing in the marketplace and that tends to show itself in -- I\u2019ll just call it long term relationships. Others might call those contracts, but I call long term relationships with our customers.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks a lot.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Paul Adler for closing remarks.\nPaul Adler: Well, thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal \u201823 financial results in late December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2023 first quarter revenue was $2.17 billion compared to $1.9 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 13.9%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 was $1.03 billion compared to $902.8 million last year, an increase of 13.9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.5% for the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 compared to 47.6% last year. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a headwind increasing 30 basis points from last year. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.5% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 49.6% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 37.3% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $440.1 million compared to $394.1 million last year. Excluding last year's first quarter gain totaling $12.1 million and recorded in selling and administrative expenses, fiscal '23 first quarter operating income increased 15.2% and operating income margin increased 20 basis points to 20.3% from 20.1% last year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 14.8% compared to 11% last year. The tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Net income for the first quarter was $351.7 million compared to $331.2 million last year. Last year's first quarter diluted EPS contained $0.09 from the previously mentioned gain and related income tax expense. Excluding the gain and the related income tax expense, this year's diluted EPS of $3.39 compared to $3.02 last year, an increase of 12.3%. First quarter operating cash flow increased 13.8%. On June 15, 2022, we paid shareholders $97.7 million in quarterly dividends. Also during the quarter, we purchased $210.8 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. We continue to allocate capital in many ways to improve shareholder return. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to do so consistently. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal '22 included not only the gain on sale of operating assets in the first quarter, but also a gain on an equity method investment in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fiscal '22 operating income was $1.55 billion, a margin of 19.7% and diluted EPS was $11.28. Please see the table in our earnings press release for more information. Fiscal '23 operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.76 billion compared to $1.55 billion in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains. Fiscal \u201823 interest expense is expected to be approximately $110 million compared to $88.8 million in fiscal '22 due in part to higher interest rates. Our fiscal '23 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. This compares to a rate of 17.9% in fiscal '22 after excluding the gains and their related tax impacts. The expected higher effective tax rate will negatively impact fiscal '23 diluted EPS by approximately $0.32 and diluted EPS growth by approximately 290 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and we remain in a dynamic environment that can continue to change. Our guidance contemplates a stable economy and excludes pandemic related setbacks or economic downturns. I'll turn it back over to Paul. Ashish, I might add that right around 60% of our energy spend is the gas, or -- gas and diesel and the remainder is electricity and natural gas. So the natural gas is a smaller component of that energy spend. More of it is the price of the pump, which as you suggested, is coming down. Well, so let me start, Andy, with the guidance. The guidance implies and we're 60 days past when we gave the initial guidance. The guidance implies really good growth through the rest of the year. But as you know, we do face some tougher comps as we saw the business pick up last year throughout the year. And so we would expect a little bit of deceleration from the growth levels of where we are, but still healthy growth and ending the year in a range of 9% to over 10%. And we like the momentum of the business today and our expectation right now is that we're not seeing any change in the value that our customers are seeing and we're not changing -- we're not seeing any change in the way in the economy, I'll say. Now -- maybe I'll flip to margins briefly. Our margin expectation remains that we will see margin improvement during the year and that range that we provided certainly contemplates that margin improvement even in a pretty challenging type of economic environment. So the guidance is a little bit better than we gave 60 days ago, part -- because of the first quarter, part because of the momentum that we see in the business. Now as it relates to -- trying to dissect what the economic picture is going to look like for the rest of the year, look, that can be pretty difficult, right? I mean, there are -- some who say we may be in a recession today. There are some who say we may be in a recession early \u201823. Some who say, we may be in a recession late in \u201823. The Fed has come out and said GDP for \u201823 is going to be 1.2%. It's hard to predict what we're going to see in the economic picture as we move forward. But what we know is that the momentum in our business today is really good. The value proposition that our customers see and our prospects see, they're reacting very positively to it. And because of that and many other factors, we believe that momentum can continue along with healthy margins. And that's what we've given you in our guidance. Does that help answer that question a bit? Tim, maybe I'll start on that. From a gross margin perspective, you're right. We're down 10 basis points from last year in a period where total energy expenses are up 30 basis points. We're up 190 basis points sequentially and so we've seen some nice improvement there. And look, when you think about that rental number of 47.5% that's a really good gross margin for us. We've only been higher than that a few times and that certainly is a much greater gross margin than we saw pre-pandemic. So we like the -- where we are in that space. We like the sequential improvement in the gross margin, which is pretty good. And we're doing it while we have -- we've seen such good growth in volume over the course of the last year and we're able to be pretty flat overall in gross margins while we're investing in the business. So in other words, that volume growth over the last 12 months has, we certainly created the need for additional capacity, particularly in our laundry facilities and we're investing as we should because we certainly want to make sure we have the capacity to serve the customer. And so nothing -- I would say nothing unusual to point out in there other than we continue to make the progress that we want to make. The only other thing I might say about that gross margin is, we're seeing an all-time high in our First Aid and Safety business. And we continue to like the way that business is trending and the mix back towards that First Aid business that we love so much. Todd mentioned that the First Aid part of that business is over 20% growth still. And we've seen some really nice movement there. So again, nothing real specific to point out other than making good sequential progress and certainly continuing to invest for our future growth. Thank you. Sure. We have -- as of the end of August, Manav, we've got about $500 million in commercial paper or other short term variable debt. And the rest of our debt is fixed or senior notes. We do have some of our 27 maturities the interest rates locked on those. Those are right now, as you can imagine, a fair amount in the money So that's where we are today and look that the -- we like that, we like a little bit of that short-term debt because it gives us optionality. We can pay that down if we feel like we want to or we can certainly have more space to use that if we needed to. Seth, I might add two things. One, you bring up kind of the structure of our pricing and we're generally the highest price relative to our competition in the space. So in other words, we don't leave with price generally. We believe that our products, our service, they are better and that generally means we are at higher price points than our competition. And I don't expect that that would change. As Todd said, we are continuing to look for ways of even improving that value more in the future. But I don't see that type of pricing changing because of the inflation going up and down. We believe that we can command the best prices because our products are better like, car hard and other products like that and our service is just better. The other thing I might add is, our pricing is, as Todd said is customer by customer and local and it's not necessarily a -- we have to offset or we look to offset inflation immediately. Generally speaking, we want to do the best for our customers and continue to add the right value, but we also know that given the way our cost structure works, we don't have to necessarily immediately offset inflation. We get, for example, the products that we rent in our rental business, we get to amortize them, right? And so if we do have to take a cost increase, we get -- we certainly get visibility before that hits our P&L because that has to go through the manufacturing process, then it gets to our locations and then it amortizes over a period of time. And so we can have multiple price increases before that hits our P&L. And that ability to anticipate and manage our cost structure as well as our pricing, it's reflected in the fact that even in this pretty darn difficult environment, we've been able to increase our margins year-over-year, certainly, excluding those one-time gains, but we've been able to continue to increase our margins during that period of time. So I just give you that color to say, we are very thoughtful about the way we price and we are thoughtful about the way we anticipate the costs within our cost structure. And it works because we're able to increase our margins in a pretty difficult inflationary environment in each of the last four quarters. Well, Shlomo, I'll speak to the SG&A piece of this. Yes, we did have some sequential increase. But Shlomo, if you look at going back to -- I've got going back to fiscal \u201815. Our first quarter SG&A is usually the highest of the year. I'll throw out the pandemic impact a year. But our first quarter is usually the highest SG&A quarter of the year and that's been consistent for a number of years. And that's simply because of some things like, we have higher payroll taxes when our equity compensation vest at that period of time. It usually happens in the first quarter. We tend to have a little bit more stock options that create more payroll taxes. We tend to have some beginning of the year meetings and other things that happen. But year-over-year, if you pull that gain out that we've been talking about, our SG&A is down 40 basis points. And so we like -- we do like the movement of that SG&A. And gosh, if you go back to pre-pandemic Q1 of 2020, we're down almost 300 basis points. If you go back to 2019's SG&A were down 260 basis points. My point Shlomo is, this is not unusual for us to have a first quarter higher SG&A because of just the way that our business works and the timing. But year-over-year, we continue to make really good performance in that. And in this case, down 40 basis points. Shlomo, I'll talk to the All Other first. I'm not sure, if you're talking year-over-year that gain that we've referred to a number of times is in the All Other. And so you have to make sure that you're stripping out that gain 14.7% for the quarter for us that is a pretty good quarter. But as Todd mentioned a little bit ago, that Uniform Direct Sale piece that can tend to move up and down a bit and be more inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter and that's a bit of what we've seen in this quarter. So once you pull out the gain from last year where we had that outsized operating margin in All Other. We're at a pretty good spot at 14.7% and it more than anything is attributable to that lumpiness in the Uniform Direct sale business. As it relates to our cash flow, look, we like where the cash flow is where our operating cash flow is up 13.7% year-over-year. Free cash flow is up 7%. And look from quarter-to-quarter, there can be puts and takes. But generally speaking, our cash flow is really good and I expect that we'll see a continued very good conversion from net income to operating cash flow. Now, when we grow and we've been growing quite nicely, we have always been a bit of a drag in working capital because our AR tends to go up as we grow. Our uniforms in service and other items in service tends to grow -- go up as we grow and that certainly has happened. But we're still turning that into really good cash flow and I would expect that that's going to continue for the rest of the year. We're going to probably be a little bit higher in CapEx during this fiscal \u201823 year because we've -- again, we've kind of come from a pandemic period where we didn't need to grow capacity and we've really seen some nice growth over the course of the last -- more than fiscal year. And that certainly means we do some investing. And so you're going to see a little bit of an increase in CapEx, but right in the range where we've guided to that 3% to 3.5% of revenue. Yeah, I think that's true. We may see some of those kinds of signs. We may see a couple of our customers go out of business depending on the type of recession. But the other thing that I think is really important is we've grown through lots of recessions in the last 50 years. And we have also sold a lot of new business through every recession. And so even if we start to see some signs that the customers are paying a little bit more attention to their spending. We know this that we're not asking them generally to spend new money. It's spend it with us and we will help them with our programs to reduce their own work content. In other words, they can -- they find their people can do more with less because we're able to take some work away from them and we're not necessarily asking them to spend new dollars. So we -- look, we're going to be paying attention to all different kinds of things within the economy, but we know this. We're going to sell a lot of new business. We're going to sell the no programmers. We're going to help our customers reduce their own work content. And that's why we feel, we not only do, we love the momentum that we have, but as we look forward, that value proposition is still resonating very, very well. We've said that a number of times and we don't see that changing And so we feel pretty good and we generally -- our guidance is a reflection of that and we like where we're headed."

            "name": "Todd Schneider",
            "content": "Thank you, Paul. We are pleased with our start to our fiscal year 2023. First quarter total revenue grew 14.2%. Each of our businesses increased revenue at a double-digit rate. The benefits of our strong revenue growth flow through to our bottom line. Excluding a one-time gain recorded in last year's first quarter selling and administrative expenses, operating income margin increased 20 basis points and EPS grew 12.3%. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. In challenge with labor scarcity and rising costs, businesses continue to turn to Cintas to help them get ready for the workday. I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Turning now to our business units. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 was $1.70 billion compared to $1.51 billion last year. Organic revenue growth was 12.3%. Revenue growth was driven mostly from increased volume. Additionally, price increases contributed at a higher level than historically. We believe such a mix of revenue drivers volume versus price is healthy and supportive of continued long-term growth. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $234.2 million compared to $199.1 million last year. Organic revenue growth was 15.8%. This rate reflects the continued momentum of our First Aid cabinet business, which continues to grow more than 20%. Personal protective equipment or PPE, while still elevated compared to pre-COVID levels declined again on a sequential basis. We welcome this mix shift because the cabinet service is a more consistent revenue stream and has higher profit margins in PPE. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $234.5 million compared to $189.7 million last year. The Fire business organic revenue growth rate was 17.4% and the Uniform Direct Sale business organic growth rate was 44.1%. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide additional details on our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $8.47 billion to $8.58 billion to a range of $8.58 billion to $8.67 billion. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $11.90 to $12.30 to a range of $12.30 to $12.65. Mike? Good morning, Ashish. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. Yeah, our new business is quite robust. We continue to be very successful in converting over no programmers into our programs in all of our businesses with the exception of fire, which obviously \u2013 they were all -- everyone's a programmer in that business, but we're having really good success there. And we look at the total addressable market and it's still incredibly large and growing. So that's exciting for us. But as far as the sales cycle, I haven't seen anything that would lead me to believe that the sales cycle is elongating. We've got really good momentum in our new business. I'm very encouraged by that. And as we've spoken about in the past, some of our investments that we have made are really paying off big in the form of some of our unique products in our rental line with our Carhartt products, our Chef Works and we've got a CareFlex line of scrubs through land out that's really successful in our unique restroom lines. And then our First Aid business, just the breadth of products that we're offering is really helping us get in the door and provide great products and services to our customers. They're also seeing our investments and technology that we've made, whether it's our garment tracking that is giving us a real advantage in the marketplace, our garment dispensing that we've seen. And I've spoken about our myCintas portal, which is unique and advantage in the marketplace. It makes it easier to do business with us and that's important for our customers and gives our sales partners confidence in walking in the door. So some really good things in -- heading in that direction. Yeah. So when you think about our energy spend, certainly, it's up over where we were a year over prior. It's down 10 basis points sequentially. Trying to anticipate exactly where that's going to head is challenging. Certainly, but I can tell you this, we are focused on efficiencies that we can drive in our business that will lower our needs for natural gas and lower our needs for gas at the pump. and we're leveraging those and that's helping us. That helps us with our CO2 emissions and it helps us with our efficiencies in our business and our spend. And we're confident we can continue to make strides there. So that's where exactly natural gas prices will go this winter, what's going on in Europe and other areas. It's tough to tell for sure, but we'll manage through it and we see opportunities to improve in our business and we're leveraging that. Thank you. Good morning, George. This is Todd. The majority of our accounts are -- come from no programmers. So that is -- that trend has been consistent over the years and continues. And in a marketplace where it's still difficult for employers to find people to work, offering a value of this and the way we handle it with uniforms is attractive for them. So it's another benefit for customers and they see that as an opportunity to attract their employees and retain their employees and we have one heck of an offering when it comes to that, that makes it really attractive for people. So I'd say those trends continue as they have in the past. Yeah, certainly. So the healthcare vertical is a very attractive vertical for us. It's growing nicely. Demographics are such in the United States and Canada that demand will continue. And we're seeing -- we have some unique offerings in that area with garment dispensing and our unique scrub line that makes it attractive. There's certainly other items that are -- that we rent into the healthcare market, whether it be an acute or non-acute. But we really like what we're seeing there from that demand. And I'll give you one example of a hospital that about six months ago, we sold a scrub rental program into that account. And it was a nice -- very nice sized customer that you would recognize a name. In that case, the nurses that we were providing the program to, they were wandering the products at home and the nurses voiced a concern about safety. Meaning, hey, what am I taking home? Am I wandering it? Am I wandering it correctly? And in that case, they chose Cintas because of a few things. One is, our technology that we've deployed that's unique that allows us to manage inventory for them, which provides the requisite access to the product, which is really, really important. And also helps control their costs based upon how we manage that inventory. But also improves the safety aspect of it, so separate from being an employee benefit, because those what I'll call potentially contaminated goods or scrubs. They don't go home. We laundry them appropriately via our hygienic process, hygienically cleaning process, which allows them to have the confidence that their process correctly and when that it's improved safety. And just as an anecdote, I mentioned that was about six months ago, just recently, we sold a microfiber wipe rental program to that same hospital. And so they use microfiber wipes in many ways, but the most obvious one is when they're cleaning guest rooms or patient rooms, we should say. In this case, that particular hospital they were purchasing those wipes and then they're having the, I'll call them hospital employees or EBS type folks that were cleaning those on their on-premise laundry. And in that case, they chose Cintas because it was able to -- we were able to reduce their labor costs. They're having trouble getting access to labor. And then again, we're processing those in a manner where they can have great confidence that they're processed correctly with a hygienically clean process. So you asked your original question, George, was about uniform demand in hospitals, which is quite good. But it also, there's so much that we can provide to those hospitals. And I just want to give one example to just give a little color around that. Thank you. Andy, thanks for the question. This is Todd. First off on retention, yeah, retention is very good. We like where that is. We like the momentum around that. We're organizing around it appropriately to make sure that we're meeting and exceeding our customers' demands. And we like our -- the product and service offering that we have and the customers find it attractive. I mentioned some of the products and the technology that we have that are unique and the customers like it. I think they also like our approach that we took over the past couple of years about being really flexible and empathetic with them as they were going through, -- what they went through the various businesses through calendar '21 and calendar '22, -- '20and '21, I should say, with the pandemic. So I think that was -- that is benefiting us because they saw that we were -- we understood what they were challenged with and we pivoted to provide them what they needed instead of just telling them, hey, here's what you contracted to buy. So I think all that is paying off. As far as productivity in new business, yeah, we like it. It's up and we are -- certainly, we love our sales force. We think they're well trained, well positioned when sales partners have confidence in the products and the technology and the services that they're going to provide, that confidence is powerful and it's showing itself in productivity and we like that. We're also deploying up (ph) types of technology, via our investment with SAP, that's paying off in a number of ways. I'll just give you one as it relates to sales, which is investing in technology that allows for what I'll call best next prospect for a sales partner. Meaning instead of just calling blindly on businesses, we want to drive to our sales team who will be the next best prospect to call, which through analytics, we can tell them where to spend their time. And that's better for the partner, that's better for our company, again that provides more confidence. And yeah, so those types of investments are paying dividends for us. Thank you. Sure. Tim, it's Todd. We're proud of the gross margin improvement that we've made in the First Aid business. It is reflective certainly of the shift of the mix of the business. But I wouldn't say that there's anything that is out of the ordinary, where you'd say, oh, my goodness. Is there something that a one timer? So, no. Now that being said, we're -- certainly there will be puts and takes of the First Aid business gross margin throughout the year, don't think of it as a linear progression upward. It's -- we're making investments. We're growing that business really attractively. We are certainly leveraging -- trying to leverage as very much as best we can. The revenue growth that we're getting, but we've got to -- we've -- as Mike pointed out in all of our businesses, we've got to invest to meet the demand. And we're doing exactly that and trying to do it as intelligently and as efficiently as possible. But we're really happy with the demand levels that we're seeing and make sure we're positioned to meet those demand levels. Thank you, Tim. Yeah. So Manav, good question. We are not seeing it in our customer base today. And as a reminder, -- as of Friday, there'll be four months into our fiscal year. And will we see it how well -- what's this recession? Are we in one, as Mike said, is there one coming in the first half of '23, the back half? We're not trying to predict all that, but we are staying acutely aware, but we're positioning ourselves to make sure that we can grow in all types of economic cycles. And as a reminder, we've grown in 51 out of the last 53 years. The only exception being the great recession. We certainly hope that any recession that comes is not as severe as what that was. And so what I'll call in, whatever the traditional type of recession, if that comes, then we expect good performance. We expect to grow. We have traditionally grown in multiples of GDP and jobs growth in the past. Mike spoke of our products and services are highly valued. You think about cleanliness, safety, image and compliance. Those are buying motors that are stronger today than they were in the past, certainly stronger than what they were even pre-pandemic. Our products and services are more diversified today. Our customer base is more diversified today than it was in the past. Today, we're 70% services and 30% goods producing. So that diversification we think will help us. And when you think about NAICS codes, we have no three digit NAICS codes that is greater than 10%. So again, a really nice diversification there. We have also invested as we've talked about in the past calls in our vertical sales approach which we think gives nice diversification into when you think about government and you think about healthcare, higher education, those types. We've spoken about our momentum that we think is really, really good. And also our strong cash flow, we think that will allow us to be opportunistic as we -- whenever we are into a recession if that is today or in the future, we're going to be well positioned to make sure we're successful. Andrew, thank you for the question. When I think about each of our businesses, we don't give guidance based upon each of them individually, but I'll just provide some maybe some top line thoughts. I'm really -- I haven't done the calculus on what it would be for the year, but I'm just thinking about Qs two through four for each. I would think about from rental, Fire and the First Aid business all being high-single digits of the balance of the year. Keeping in mind that there was some PPE in the First Aid business in Q3 which will provide a tougher comp for sure. And then in our Uniform Direct Sale business, we're going to be up against much tougher comps. So I would think of that from high-single to flat, maybe even negative in Q4 based upon the significant comps that we're up against there, which is obviously a little bit more lumpy business. Yes. So when you think about Uniform Direct Sale business, again, a lumpier business, high single to -- from Q2 through Q4. Think about high-singles down to closer to flat to maybe even negative in Q4, due to sales growth due to the significant comps that will be up against on the back half of the year. Great. Thank you. Great. Faiza, thanks for the question. It's Todd. I'll start if Mike you want to chime in. There's many contributing inputs to our positive growth that we're seeing. New business is quite good as we spoke about, but retention and penetration is very attractive as well. We continue to improve upon our cross sell. And as you mentioned, pricing is certainly playing a larger role than it did historically, as it should because of the levels of cost increase that we are seeing via whether it's labor or material cost and what have you. So I think just generally speaking, we like the key inputs that we're seeing. I mentioned earlier our diversification into those various businesses, verticals, et cetera., they're all -- we like the momentum we're seeing in all those, so pretty widespread. Good question on labor. I'd say, easing a bit, but that's relative. It is still a very challenging environment. But maybe not as quite as challenging as it was six months ago, eight months ago, but still quite challenging. And we are in constant pursuit of a tracking and retaining the very, very best people. We think that gives us competitive advantage in the marketplace. So when we look out and say, okay, what does that mean to us? We're constantly in pursuit of that. So any easing of the labor market would certainly be welcome from a standpoint of making a little bit easier to run at lower RPMs. But here's what I know is we -- our team figures it out and they have -- they are staffed at the appropriate levels to meet our customers' demand. They've done one heck of a job in fighting through all these challenges over the past couple of years to make sure that we're positioned to be successful. So whatever the environment, our team will figure it out. We've shown that they'll be in the past. We'll pivot appropriately, but -- so we'll manage through it. Thank you. Heather, thanks for the question. Again, our experience is very broad in our successes that we're seeing. I'll just give you one another example that might provide a little color. In one of our verticals, where we're calling on the government sector. There's one particular city that I won't mention, but you'll know the name of it. About a year ago, we sold a uniform program into that city. And as an example there, that was into the sanitation, transportation, parts and recreation type departments. And in that case, they were using a local provider before we took over that account. And they chose us in that case because they liked our garment offering was better, meaning they thought we had better, more attractive garments that their employees wanted to wear. Our garment tracking technology help them to reduce costs, meaning less lost garments and what have you. And then as I mentioned earlier, our investment into our My Cintas web portal makes it may be easier for them to do business with us. So which reduces their administrative time and just helpful for them. So that was about a year ago and then, If you fast forward just recently, we sold them a First Aid cabinet service to all those departments and even more municipal buildings. And in that case, previously they had ordered all their first aid products online. So they were a no programmer. They were ordering it from whomever online and then they were essentially doing all that work and filling those candidates themselves. Inquisidentally, the sales lead for that opportunity came from our uniform service provider. So while they're the uniform service provider was speaking to the customer and they said, hey, we need help here. So the uniform service provider pass it on to our -- the appropriate person in our First Aid service provider. In that case, they chose us because, again, a better management of the products and we're able to help them manage the products better, improve their compliance, reduce their costs and remove their need to administer the program. So you think about what businesses are challenged with. In this case, it was a city government, but it's still, they're still running it as a business where they have to meet their customers' demands and their employees' demands. And I think another example of just how we are growing our business and why it's attractive for businesses, sticky, good retention, good cross sell and that shows itself in new business. Hopefully that color helps a little bit. Well, Heather, pricing is a local subject. It's a customer by customer subject. Meaning some businesses are doing better than others. And -- but as we look at that, when inflation kicked in to much higher degrees than that required us to make sure that our price adjustments were higher than historical as well. So you can think of about it that way when inflation was -- went to above historical levels. That's when we adjust to pricing at above historical levels. And as far as what that means moving forward, that will depend upon the -- what inflation does moving forward. So I don't have a crystal ball as it applies to that or a recession what have you, but we're paying very, very close attention to all those inputs and we'll manage it appropriately. Thank you. Yeah, Seth. It's a fair question. As I think about our customer base, we're such a broad customer base. So some of them, we have contractual commitments, some of them we have the ability to adjust prices closer to inflation and what have you. So it's very, very broad and it really depends on the particular customer and the health of that customer as well. But here's what I can tell you is that we take a long term approach. We don't think about our customers and quarters or fiscal years, we think about them in over decades. And that approach has really paid-off big dividends for us. Now, we are constantly trying to improve the value that we provide to our customers. That being said, when inflation is at the levels it's at, it requires us to adjust prices at above historical. When inflation comes back down and we certainly hope and expect that that will occur. Then I think you can think of our price adjustments to be back closer to more historical. We're now -- am I constantly trying to improve the value to our customers? Absolutely. That pursuit will be in perpetuity and the marketplace determines how that pricing is handled appropriately. Scott, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Mike, certainly if you want to chime in. When we think about, again, are we in a recession technical? It's one coming in early '23, late '23 how severe we don't know those items, but we are watching it very closely. When you think about our customer base, how might it show up? We'll customers if their demand is being impacted then they're going to look for ways to cut their costs. Is that in getting a no look at their P&L and say, okay, what's the biggest things I can move on? And frankly, we're not usually top of their list. So -- and the reason being is because our spend per customer is pretty small. But that being said, we'll -- will they reduce their needs for certain services, reduce quantities of products that they need. Certainly those types of things can happen if their demand is being impacted. So those are the items that we look for is, our customers reducing their needs because their demand of their business is such that they don't need as much. So I'd say that would be one of the certainly bigger categories that we look for. Mike, any other thoughts, but those are the first one that came in mind. Yeah, Scott. This is Todd. Our deal flow is good. We love our balance sheet, who love our position in the marketplace. That being said, those M&A type of opportunities, they -- tough to pay some, toughed there are various items that cause things to flip the switch for someone to sell their business. But I can tell you this, we're really well positioned. Love our balance sheet, love our team and the ability to manage through any M&A. And we think that that's going to be an opportunity for us in the future and we're well positioned for it. That being said, again, it's tough to pace them, but deal flow looks good and I don't see anything that's all that different from a multiple standpoint in the marketplace. So we're interested in any and all opportunities from an M&A standpoint and we'll continue to push for those. Thank you. Yeah, Tony. It's Todd, you're absolutely correct. And when we look forward, we see incremental margins. We've talked about 20% to 30% and we see that in our future. And we are leveraging certainly the top line very nicely. We manage our variable costs. I think quite well, the team is very, very good at that. But we're also getting efficiencies from some of our digital transformation that we've talked about in the past. You see that certainly energy is a big subject today, but we've talked about our Smart Truck proprietary routing technology that's helping us reduce idle time and drive time, which obviously helps with energy spend, but it helps with CO2 emissions as well. And one of the things, we talk about around here is that we don't make money when the wheels are moving on our trucks. So getting those efficiencies is very important. We're extracting other efficiencies via our investment with SAP, with our inventory control programs that are allowing us to get better reuse of our products in our stockrooms, which also helps improve turnaround time for our customers. We think it's very, very important which gives us an advantage in the marketplace. I mentioned in our last call, we have an operational excellence dashboard that provides us better transparency into the efficiency levels at each of our production facilities. So that is significant, right? So we're able to understand the efficiency levels of our facilities not by having to be there in person every day, but by understanding the metrics of our operational excellence dashboard in real time. So I guess it's a blessing that we have those opportunities to improve. It's frustrating that we have opportunities to improve, but we're focused on improving those and extracting those efficiencies. So that will allow us to continue to provide good incremental margins separate from the items that I mentioned before with some of the other technologies that we deployed with making it a better win for customers and how they're doing business with us. So yeah, as we look forward, we're going to continue to those efficiencies and provide what we think are attractive incremental margins. Tony, I would say, it's nothing out of the ordinary, certainly, we take a very long term approach with our customers. They take a long term approach with us and we make sure that, that we're positioned to meet their needs and exceed them and provide products and services that they really value. And so that's what we're doing in the marketplace and that tends to show itself in -- I'll just call it long term relationships. Others might call those contracts, but I call long term relationships with our customers. Thank you."

I will now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. Our fourth quarter performance marked a strong finish to another successful year for Cintas. Fourth quarter total revenue grew 8.2% to $2.47 billion, an all-time high for revenue in a quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.5%. And importantly, each of our businesses continue to perform well and execute at a high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was $1.22 billion, an increase of 11.6% over the prior year. Gross margin increased 150 basis points from 47.7% to 49.2%. Operating income for the fourth quarter of $547.6 million increased 16.3% over the prior year. Operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22.2% from 20.6% in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income was $414.3 million, an increase of 19.7%. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.99, an increase of 19.8% over the prior year fourth quarter. These results conclude a strong fiscal year marked by significant accomplishments, including robust revenue growth and margin expansion and excellent cash generation, which continue to fuel our balanced capital allocation strategy. The following are specific highlights of fiscal '24. I'd like to begin with revenue. Fiscal year revenue was a record $9.6 billion, an increase of 8.9%. Organic growth was 8% for the year. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time. Our top line growth is a function of the total value proposition we offer customers of all sizes and across industries and unique Cintas culture that drives our partners to deliver an outstanding customer experience. Business across our focused verticals of health care, hospitality, education, and state and local government continue to perform well. We experienced strong demand for our services not only from existing customers but across our new business pipeline. About two-third of our new customers continue to come from no-programmers, underscoring our ability to capitalize on the vast growth opportunity that remains ahead. In addition, our retention rates remain strong. Our strong revenue performance also translated into continued growth in profits and earnings, including the following highlights. Fiscal '24 operating income grew 14.8% for the year, and our operating margin of 21.6% was an all-time high. EPS grew 16.6% for the year. Our enhanced profitability and earnings growth is a reflection of our relentless focus on operational excellence in every aspect of our business, spanning strategic sourcing and supply chain initiatives, route and energy optimization opportunities with SmartTruck, and leveraging the SAP system to support greater stockroom visibility and efficient garment sharing. Our cash flow from operating activities exceeded $2 billion for the first time. Strong cash generation provides us even greater flexibility to deploy capital across each of our capital allocation priorities throughout the year. Our number one capital allocation priority is investing back in the business. We prioritize investments in technology, infrastructure, and people to support our sustained growth and value creation over the long term. As we continue to grow and create value, capital is required to add capacity in a number of ways, including new facilities, new equipment, new vehicles as well as technologies to make our partners more successful. We spent $186.8 million in fiscal '24 on acquisitions. This is the most we've spent on acquisitions since fiscal '17. We love acquisitions as they provide us with new customers where we can offer a broader range of products and services. Sometimes they can bring needed capacity that can also bring attractive synergies that involve leveraging our existing route structures, providing more time with customers and less time driving. Another of our priorities is returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In fiscal '24, we increased our quarterly per share dividend by 17.4%, marking the 40th consecutive year that we've increased our dividend, including every year since going public. We also bought back $1 billion of shares during fiscal '24 and up through yesterday. Lastly, we were named to the prestigious Fortune 500 for the eighth consecutive year. It is an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We're proud of these results and the value we continue to deliver for the Cintas shareholders. That performance reflects the focus and great execution by our employees whom we call partners. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our fourth quarter results.\nMike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal '24 fourth quarter revenue was $2.47 billion compared to $2.28 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.5%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.22 billion compared to $1.09 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 47.7% last year, an increase of 150 basis points. Strong growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage, aided by the performance of our global supply chain and focused efforts to extract inefficiencies from the business via our Six Sigma engineering teams as well as technologies like SmartTruck. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.91 billion compared to $1.77 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 7.1%. As we have done in the past, I will share revenue mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, there can be small fluctuations in mix between quarters. Uniform rental was 48%; dust was 19%; hygiene was 16%; shop towels were 4%; linen, which includes microfiber, wipes, towels and aprons, was 10%; and catalog revenue was 3%. These percentages are consistent with last year and demonstrate we are experiencing strong demand across all our products and services. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 48.6% compared to 47.7% last year. This 90 basis point improvement was the result of good top line growth that continue to generate great operating leverage and excellent sourcing and process improvements, which continue to create additional efficiencies such as garment sharing and SmartTruck. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $277.6 million compared to $249.8 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11.1%, capping off another year of double-digit organic growth. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 55.4% compared to 51% last year. This 440 basis point improvement was a result of our double-digit revenue growth that created solid operating leverage, an improved sales mix, a dedicated first aid distribution center that has lowered costs as well as efficiencies from our SmartTruck technology. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $282.1 million compared to $261.5 million last year. The Fire Protection revenue was $197.9 million, and the organic revenue growth rate was 12.9%, resulting in another year of double-digit organic growth. The Uniform Direct Sale revenue was $84.2 million, and organic revenue decreased 4.4%. The organic growth rate in Uniform Direct Sales can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Gross margin for Fire Protection Services was an all-time high of 50% compared to 47.9% last year. This 210 basis point improvement was primarily the result of robust revenue growth that generated strong operating leverage along with route productivity improvements. Gross margin for Uniform Direct Sales was 40.9% compared to 36% last year. This 490 basis point improvement was the result of higher margin accounts from a disciplined approach to the market. Fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was 27%, which was a 10 basis point improvement from last year. We were able to create leverage with these costs while continuing to invest in technology and selling resources. Fourth quarter operating income was $547.6 million compared to $470.8 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 22.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.6% in last year's fourth quarter. The fourth quarter marks the first time that all three operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and Fire Protection Services exceeded 22% in operating income in the same quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.4% compared to 22.4% last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $414.3 million compared to $346.2 million last year. This year's fourth quarter diluted EPS was $3.99 compared to $3.33 last year, an increase of 19.8%. I'll now turn the call back over to Todd to provide his thoughts on next year and our financial expectations for fiscal '25.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Mike. As we move into fiscal '25, we expect to exceed $10 billion in annual revenue for the first time. This outlook, coupled with our strong fiscal '24 results, demonstrate that our value proposition continues to resonate. Every business in North America, goods-producing or services-providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. We help our customers meet those needs so they can focus on running their businesses. As we deliver on our customers' needs, our culture remains our greatest competitive advantage, and it drives our focus on continuous improvement and evolving for the future. We will continue to prioritize investments in technology, infrastructure, and people. Our technology investments include our continued investment in SAP with our Fire division currently going through the implementation process. In addition to SAP, we have partnered with Verizon and Google to deploy technology solutions that make it easier for our partners to run their business and easier for our customers to do business with us. In addition, technology initiatives such as SmartTruck and garment sharing are helping to drive customer satisfaction as well as efficiencies throughout the organization. Our working partners really are the key to our success. We know that when we take care of our partners, they will, in turn, take great care of our customers. We are investing in training our partners and giving them the best and latest tools to make their jobs easier while also investing in talent acquisition in order to ensure we are properly staffed to support our growth initiatives. The future of Cintas remains bright, and our fiscal '25 guidance reflects that outlook. For fiscal '25, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $10.16 billion to $10.31 billion, a total growth rate of 5.9% to 7.4%. Please note the following: fiscal '25 will have two fewer workdays compared to fiscal '24. Each quarter of fiscal '25 will have 65 workdays. The two fewer workdays will impact the first and fourth quarters by one day each. The revenue growth rate in each of those two quarters will be negatively affected by about 160 basis points. Please keep that in mind when modeling. Adjusting for the impact of two fewer workdays, acquisitions already completed and at constant currency, our total organic growth rate for next year is expected to be 6.4% to 8%. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $16.25 to $16.75, a growth rate of 7.3% to 10.6%. Fiscal '25 net interest expense is expected to be approximately $106 million compared to $95 million in fiscal '24, predominantly as a result of higher variable rate debt used to complete a portion of the previously mentioned share buybacks. Our fiscal '25 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.4%, the same compared to our fiscal '24. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. I want to end by thanking our partners for their tremendous efforts to achieve a successful fiscal '24. As we look ahead to fiscal '25, our outlook reflects our continued confidence in our strategy. We remain focused on delivering outstanding customer experiences, reinforcing the unique Cintas culture that drives our success while making the necessary investments in the business to sustain our growth through fiscal '25 and long beyond. I'll now turn the call back over to Jared.\nJared Mattingley: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Joshua.\nJoshua Chan: Congrats on a strong quarter. I was wondering if you guys could comment on your retention rates. I know that you've said it's generally stable. Have you seen any slight uptick in industry churn or downtick in retention, I guess? How are you seeing your customers behave in this environment?\nTodd Schneider: Thanks for your comments. We really haven't seen a change in our customer behavior. As I mentioned, our retention rates are still at very attractive levels. And when you have as broad of a customer base as we do, there are certainly some aspects that are doing -- that are thriving and some that are struggling. It varies based upon industry. It varies based upon geography. But when you speak as a whole, I would say our customer base is -- we haven't seen much change in it so far.\nJoshua Chan: That's great to hear. And then for my follow-up, could you just kind of talk about your reasoning behind choosing the 6.4% to 8.0% organic growth for next year? I guess in the context of just doing 7.5% in Q4, what are the scenarios that would lead you to the bottom and the top end of the growth range?\nTodd Schneider: Well, Josh, we really like where we -- our guide is. We like where our business is. And that's where we -- that's kind of where we target our business to grow at those types of levels. Certainly, we read the overall macro data that we -- that you all read about what's going on in the economy. So, we watch that. But we don't expect much change at this point. And as a result, I'd say we expect to be right in that guide. We'd love for the economy to go even faster. But nevertheless, we find ways to be successful. Our value proposition is resonating. We have -- we service a little over 1 million customers or 16 million businesses in our market, and we have all kinds of ways to grow. And I think we've shown that we have the ability to exceed GDP growth and exceed employment growth. So, we would certainly love for our customers to be thriving and adding people all over the place. But nevertheless, we're going to find a way to be successful and we're confident in our guide.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather.\nHeather Balsky: Can you just kind of update us on how you're thinking about incremental margins and how you're thinking about the margin story for 2025? What are the bigger tailwinds? What are you most excited about? And anything going on in the cost environment as well?\nTodd Schneider: Well, I'll start, Heather. As we think about margin expansion, and our guide reflects margin expansion with the first item we think about as it comes to that is leverage, leverage on revenue growth. And we've demonstrated that we have the ability to do that, and we'll continue to do that. And that's easy to say, hard to do, but the team has done an incredible job in so many areas, starting with our global supply chain, which is a competitive advantage in the marketplace. How they go about their jobs, the fact that they have dual source or many sources for 90% or more of the products that we source, so how they go about that. The great work that's been done on material costs, again, starting with sourcing. But also, we leverage our SAP system to help us to improve our garment sharing. And we've been working on this for years and it's bearing fruit not only in our cost structure but also in turnaround time for our customers. So, it helps us to get product to our customers faster when it's in our stockrooms versus having to order new out of our distribution centers. Better for our customers, better for our financials, and that's paying off for us.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead, Andy.\nAndy Wittmann: I just thought I would start with the competitive environment. Both of your largest competitors have noted increased competition out there. And I know that your product and service offering is a little bit broader. But I thought just given those competitor comments, I would take your temperature and have you comment, if you could, please, on what you're seeing out there in the competitive environment.\nTodd Schneider: Andy, here's what I'll tell you is that we operate in a highly competitive market. Always have, always will. I'm sure. I've been with the Company for 35 years. It's been competitive every day since I've been here. Now that being said, our revenue retention rates, as I mentioned, are attractive. And part of it is because our new business wins tend to come from the no-program market and less from the competition. So, as I mentioned earlier, there's 16 million businesses out there. We service about 1 million. So, the white space out there is incredible. And we're focused on converting those folks from, I'll call it, a do-it-yourself type to a customer of ours. And that value proposition is resonating because we help them focus on taking care of their customers or their patients or their guests or whatever, however you want to describe it, and we take that for them. And we're able to do it better, faster, smarter and, in many cases, cheaper than what they were doing it. So yes, is it competitive? Heck yes. It's always been competitive and we're focused on growing the market and that's been a good model for us.\nAndy Wittmann: I appreciate that. And then I guess, maybe Mike, I guess I wanted to kind of ask some of the margin questions in a little bit different way. First, as I was just kind of doing the math between the EPS and the revenue, I was getting somewhere around 20 or 30 basis points of implied operating margin expansion for the year. So maybe you could just clarify that. But that's a pretty decent deceleration from the amount of margin expansion certainly you saw in the quarter or even over the course of the past fiscal year. So, I was just wondering if you could comment on if there's anything, any categories inside the P&L that we should be aware of that are inflating more materially, or if there's other areas, maybe energy costs, I don't know, that we should be aware of that could be weighing on continued margin expansion like we've seen here in recent quarters.\nMike Hansen: Andy, the short answer to are there any new headwinds, the short answer is no, with the exception of maybe the two fewer workdays where as you've heard us talk about, for example, in the first quarter, we talked a little bit about the top line impact being 160 basis points of growth headwind. But also, you've also heard us talk about margins. When we lose a workday, we've generally talked about a 50 basis point impact. We lose two workdays next year. We've done such a good job of leveraging our infrastructure that the loss of a workday in a quarter is probably more like 30 to 40 basis points now. But we lose two workdays, and so there'll be a little bit of headwind from that. That is just sort of a product of the calendar and not necessarily the business. Having said that, the business is still operating really well. And if you think about the -- we think about the guidance range is generally in the, you can call it, the 25% to 35% incremental margin range. And so, it is a pretty good margin range of the 30 basis points that you referred to, Andy. We would kind of say, look at the very bottom. There still is margin expansion at the very bottom of our range. At the top of the range, there's more than 30 basis points, probably more like 70 basis points. So, the year, we think this is a typical guide range for us. As you saw in our fourth quarter, the initiatives and the operational excellence that we have worked so hard on have continued in the fourth quarter. And given this guide, we expect those to continue into fiscal '25.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.\nGeorge Tong: Can you talk a bit about the progress you're making with penetrating your high-growth focused verticals, including health care, hospitality, education, and government? Where are you seeing particularly good traction?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, we really like the verticals that we've chosen. And as a reminder, it's not just a sales strategy. It is also how we organize around those customers, those industries, those verticals to make sure that we're meeting, exceeding their needs because they're a little different. And as we do that, the products, the services that we provide, the support that we provide all comes along with that. And so yes, they're all operating at attractive levels. And I wouldn't call anyone out specifically where I'd say, oh my gosh, that one's exceeding. They're all doing quite well. I thought it might be helpful to talk a little bit about a recent health care win that we had. We recently sold a large hospital network with scrub dispensing technology for the scrubs in the various departments throughout an acute care hospital. But we're also having really good success with surgery centers and those types that are attached to the large acute care hospital networks. And you're probably seeing some of that acute care hospital networks having investments in other areas. So, in fact, I'd say three large health care systems came to us for help with their non-acute facilities. When I say non-acute facilities, I'm talking about really surgery centers, clinics, physician offices, those types. And they came to us and said, \"You're doing a great job for acute care. Can you help us with the non-acute?\" And what does that do for them? It allows them to have a consistent supply but also allows them to consolidate vendors. So, we're seeing good success certainly in health care. But the other verticals are all performing well. And we like the decisions, the investments that we've made in those areas, and we think they're going to continue to pay dividends for us.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.\nTim Mulrooney: Just one from me, and I hopped on late so apologies if this has been addressed, but a few of your competitors have recently cited more pricing pushback and an increasing number of customers putting their contracts out to bid. I'm wondering on this pricing idea if you're seeing a similar dynamic where customers are becoming more price sensitive in this environment. Or do you think that this is less of an issue for the industry overall and could perhaps be more specific to these individual companies or markets?\nTodd Schneider: So, I'd say nothing to call out specifically there. It's still really a normal operating environment. As I mentioned earlier, we operate in a highly competitive market. So, we've got to make sure that we're -- our value proposition is resonating with our customers and we're providing outstanding customer service. We've said that our plan is to lower pricing back towards historical levels and that's what we're seeing. And I would just point out that as we've moderated pricing, even in fiscal '24, we were able to expand operating margins 120 basis points. And so, we're finding ways to provide great value for our customers while moderating pricing but still extracting inefficiencies out of our business so that we can improve operating margins.\nTim Mulrooney: Okay, so not really seeing pushback on pricing. And Todd, would you say it certainly is not lost on us that you had strong incrementals this quarter as pricing moderated. Would you say now pricing has fully normalized? That there is no more headwinds as we head into 2025 from moderating pricing? Or is that -- are you still in that process?\nTodd Schneider: Tim, we've -- as I mentioned, it's a highly competitive market. We have continued to moderate pricing. And pricing is a local subject. It really depends upon the customers, what their operating environment's like, what their customer base is doing, those types. So, we continue to monitor that and manage it appropriately based upon our local businesses and making sure that we're meeting our customers' needs and thinking about the long-term value of a customer because we don't look at it and say, we're focused on the near term or in the short term. We're focused on the long term for our customers, and we'll continue to manage pricing in that manner.\nMike Hansen: And I might just add, Tim, to your question, probably not a lot of fiscal '25 to fiscal '24 year-over-year pricing change.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Andrew.\nAndrew Steinerman: If you could believe it, I'm just going to ask you to clarify something you just said. So, you talked about moderating pricing. When I hear the words moderating pricing, I hear price decreases. I assume what you mean is you're moderating to a more normal type of modest price increase. And then when talking about fiscal '25, are you talking about modest price increases or really flat pricing year-over-year for existing customers?\nTodd Schneider: Just to clarify, moderating pricing is the way you characterized it, which is we are passing through modest price increases based upon our agreement and relationship with that customer. And that varies based upon customers, geographies, industries, et cetera. But yes, the way you described it is appropriate. It's a modest price increase with customers in general.\nAndrew Steinerman: That's true for the fiscal '25, too, right?\nTodd Schneider: That would be correct.\nAndrew Steinerman: Good clarification.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Bibb.\nJasper Bibb: Was hoping you could give a bit more color on what you're seeing as far as net headcount at customers or their hiring posture and any expectations there embedded in your fiscal '25 organic growth guidance.\nTodd Schneider: Yes, it really varies. As I mentioned, we have such a broad customer base in geographies but really not much change in customer behavior when it comes to hiring. We're seeing a pretty -- the environment is, I'll call it, stable and hasn't really changed much in the past few quarters.\nJasper Bibb: Got it. Last one for me. Maybe asking an earlier question a little bit differently. With this whole dynamic of peers talking about increased churn, including at some of the larger national accounts, if you're not seeing a pricing or retention hit, are you potentially taking away some of this competitor business at a higher rate, given these market dynamics?\nTodd Schneider: Well, here's the way I'd describe it is we operate in a really competitive environment. And so, we're out there trying to do the best to take care of our customers fighting for business every day. And I wouldn't characterize it as really much of a change in the environment. It's always really competitive. And we're continuing to try to position our organization with the best products, the best services, the best technology so that they can be successful in the marketplace.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead, Manav.\nManav Patnaik: I just had one question. Earlier, you talked about how you've been the most active in M&A for many years now. So just curious if you could just talk a little bit more about why now and perhaps what the pipeline in each of your segments looks like for future M&A?\nTodd Schneider: As you know, M&A, it's tough to predict. We think about it long term and make sure that we have relationships so that when someone does decide that they want to transact, that we're well positioned. So, it's really tough to predict deal flow. But again, we think about long term, and we want to be -- we find M&A really attractive and in large part because of, as I mentioned earlier, it gives us a new set of customers that we can offer a wider breadth of products and services that we offer. There can be highly attractive synergies. In many cases, we get some infrastructure that is important to us. And we always get great people and we learn from those. So yes, we're highly interested in M&A of all shapes and sizes and we're active in those markets. Tough to pace it. It takes two to dance. And we just want to make sure we're at the dance and ready.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.\nScott Schneeberger: The first one is just you've been speaking over the course of the year about investing in your selling capabilities, technology, management training. Just an update there. And also, you've been alluding a lot to myCintas portal. Any quantification you can put on that about penetration or anything else about how that's progressing?\nTodd Schneider: It's tough to put a number on that. It's kind of like, how do you put a value on the culture of Cintas? We're constantly reinvesting in those technologies, in those trainings to position our people to be more successful. We talk about making it easier for them to do their jobs and make it easier for our customers to do business with us. So those are all investments that are long-term thinking, long-term investments that positions our people to be successful in the marketplace. Some of those investments pay off faster but it's a continual investment. And when we think about those investments, it is -- we have an amazing team of partners that are out every day taking great care of the customers. We want to make it easier for them. And we want to make it -- give them data that allows them to provide more value to the customers, make it less laborious for them to do their jobs and allow customers the ability to self-serve and have many conduits to do business with Cintas and also communicate with Cintas. So, all those investments are ongoing and will be, frankly, probably ongoing in perpetuity because that's the nature of business now that technology plays a key role. And we're blessed to have a balance sheet where we can invest appropriately and position our team to be really successful.\nScott Schneeberger: And the follow-up is, I just figured fiscal year-end and all-time high in the fourth quarter on the operating margin. So, kind of a conceptual longer-term question. You guys have done great since implementing the ERP and reaping benefits from it. What can you get to for peak margins? I mean, you've talked about incremental margins, 25%, 35% range. Can you get to 25% promptly? Can you get to 30% longer term? Just some consideration on what aspirational targets would be reasonable.\nMike Hansen: Scott, I would say this, we don't like to put a ceiling on our aspirations, but we certainly think that we can continue to improve margins. And so maybe a couple of points. First of all, 25% to 35% incremental operating margins, we've got locations that are operating at the 30-plus level today. And so, we -- and that's in all of our businesses. And so, there is a pathway there and we are continuing to work on it. Sometimes it's better scale and density. Sometimes it's a little bit of product mix. Sometimes it's the newness of the location. But we have those examples, and we're continuing to get all of our locations closer and closer to those highest operating locations. And that incremental operating margin range of 25% to 35%, in our minds, tells us, certainly, we can work -- continue to work to get there. As you go back to the -- you've talked a little bit about technology. I would say that we're still in the early innings of technology. We've become much, much better at operating on the SAP system. And it's only been about four years since we've been -- since our rental business has been fully on and Fire is not on yet. And so, we have been getting better and better at using that system. But as you know, as we've talked about over the course of the last year or so, there are still a lot of things that can come with our Google and Verizon and SAP partnerships that we are just touching the surface on. And we think that can be a big driver of continued margin expansion into the future. Not ready to put a date on when we can hit 25% or 30%, but we certainly have that in our sights and we'll continue to work hard to get there.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead, Shlomo.\nAdam Parrington: This is Adam on for Shlomo. Could you just maybe provide a little bit of outlook for Uniform Direct Sales and Fire Protection businesses for '25? And how much of a margin impact should there be in the Fire business from the SAP implementation you alluded to last quarter?\nMike Hansen: From a Fire Protection business perspective, we're still in the implementation phase of that. And there's going to be a little bit of pressure on there. I'm not going to give a specific guidance in terms of their margin. But there'll be some pressure as we go through, keeping in mind when we go through an implementation, there is the work of the implementation, the work of training all of our people to use it, the inefficiencies that come along with that, and we will then get better and better. And fiscal '25 is going to be a little bit of a year of that training and implementation period. And so, I would say that's going to be a little bit of pressure on the margins there. Certainly, that's incorporated within our overall guide of margin improvement. From a Uniform Direct Sale perspective, our margins have been really good. We've been working on selling the right types of programs, and our Uniform Direct Sale partners are doing a great job in that area. But having said all of that, a little bit hard to tell based on that SAP implementation in Fire, but keeping in mind that's included with our overall guide.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, Ashish.\nAshish Sabadra: Maybe just a question on the guidance philosophy because when we think about the organic growth in the quarter, still continues to be pretty robust compared to the industry growth profile at 7.5%, but it has moderated over the last eight quarters. The higher end of the guidance implies -- the 8% organic growth implies an inflection in growth. And historically, you've always set your guide where you have beaten and raised to guidance throughout the year. So, as we think about where do we really see the inflection? And in terms of guidance philosophy, when you say, is it equally conservative as we have seen in the prior years?\nMike Hansen: Well, I'll say maybe this, Ashish. We had an 8% organic growth rate year this year, and that was a really good year in a year where, again, last year, we were at about 12.2% and 10% the previous year. And these were years where there was just heavy inflation. And as you know, our pricing was a little bit higher than norm. And we got the 8% this year in sort of that bringing the price increases back to something closer to historical levels. As we think about our guide, maybe I'll throw out a couple of numbers to you. And as Todd has been mentioning, we've had a -- we've not seen a lot of change in customer behavior. And we've had some really good performance in our full fiscal '24 year but I'll point out a couple. In our third quarter, if you adjust for the workdays, our total growth was 8.2%. In the fourth quarter, our total growth was 8.2%. In our guide, when you think about just simply the workday, our guide range is 6.7% to 8.3%. So, our guide range is effectively telling you we're seeing the business operate in much of the same manner as we saw in the second half of the year. If you look at the organic numbers in those -- in the third quarter, fourth quarter and next year, same story. And so, the philosophy is a little bit of, look, we have to build a bit of a range because we have to consider certain alternatives. But effectively, the guide range for fiscal '25 on the top line is right in line with what you've seen particularly in the second half of fiscal '24. And that is really nice growth in all of our businesses, certainly in Uniform Rental, First Aid and Safety, and Fire Protection. So hopefully, that helps a little bit, Ashish.\nAshish Sabadra: Yes. No, that's very helpful color.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Faiza.\nFaiza Alwy: So, you mentioned earlier in the call about the white space opportunity and just the traction you're getting with no-programmers. I think relative to historical levels, the contribution from no-programmers to growth has been higher. So, I'm curious if you can talk about what you're doing differently. Are you maybe using technology? Has the pit changed a little bit? Is there something about the underlying environment? So just curious on what's driving sort of incremental contribution from no-programmers.\nTodd Schneider: I'll start, and Mike, if you'd like to contribute. Faiza, good morning, and for several decades now, we have had a focus on trying to grow the pie of the business, and that white space is significant. So, we teach our organization about how to attract no-programmers. And it's a little different process. And it takes -- it's more of a conceptual sell versus something, I'll call it, more about -- well, you've got to coach them and teach them about how to do something different instead of simply doing it yourself. And again, that's a conceptual sell and we teach our folks on how to do that. And we happen to be blessed with being in a spot where there is a massive white space out there. And I'll say it's a harder concept to get across to people. But we've been doing it for so long that it's just part of how our organization operates. And we think that's exciting for us. No real obvious change I would point to. It's just part of our culture. It's part of how we teach and train our partners on how to approach that. And it resonates with people because they get the concept of outsourcing. They get the concept of, yes, maybe I am struggling to keep up with all this. And you can do it, you can do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper than I can. And that's been a key fundamental of how we've grown our business over the years and how we'll continue to grow our business into the future.\nMike Hansen: Faiza, maybe I'll offer this a bit. If you think about the health care vertical that we've been in for maybe a decade or so now. When we got into that, we needed to create a sales team because it's just a different kind of sale, different kind of relationships. And so, we had to create a different kind of sales team. When we did that, we started with sort of maintenance uniforms, uniform rental and maintenance because we didn't have a broad product offering. As we continued in that business, we started to learn through dialogue with the customers how else we can help them, and we started things like microfiber and we started rental programs in microfiber. And that started to take off and has become a nice product for us. As we continued to have dialogue with them, that sort of evolved into then scrub rental programs. These came out of, again, dialogue with how can we help our customers. And so, this health care has grown from almost nothing to, call it, 8% of our revenue now. And it's largely because of the adaptation of our people to this new type of vertical, along with our dialogue with our customers and creating a real nice partnership, that then creates some innovation, that gets innovation flowing for us in new products and services. And then if we couple that with technology of having more information at our fingertips, of being able to find better prospecting. As we can better able to tell what customers have, which products and where might the warmest leads and so on be, over time, we have been able to grow the business and through that, grow the productivity. And so, all of these things that we do that Todd talks about, they don't happen overnight. They are the evolution and continued dialogue and collaboration with our customers to become more and more ingrained in what we do with them. And so, the -- you asked about the white space. This is just a continued evolution of that collaboration, innovation, technology wins, productivity improvement.\nFaiza Alwy: That's very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on CapEx. You mentioned at the outset as a priority. I know we saw an increase in CapEx in 2024. And apologies if I missed it. I don't know if you gave a specific number, but just talk a bit more about some of the CapEx investments and how we should think about that going forward.\nMike Hansen: We were about 4.3% in fiscal '24 as a percent of revenue. You might remember, we had a little bit of a catch-up in truck purchasing through the year. We had some of the SAP investment for Fire Protection. We largely believe that CapEx in the future is the 3.5% to 4% of revenue range. I think that's where we'll likely end up in fiscal '25.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie.\nStephanie Moore: I wanted to follow up actually on just the last question there and just one quick question. Are you finding potentially some increased activity from new customers that are viewing maybe a value proposition differently? So maybe taken another way, with higher inflationary environment, maybe not looking to kind of do it in-house and kind of have that initial capital outlay and your value proposition is coming in. Has that been a contributing driver to the growth?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, there's many inputs to it. Certainly, if you are with a rental uniform program, if you want to buy garments, there's a large capital outlay versus us doing that for the customer, and other areas where you might have to go buy dispensers for chemicals or soaps, towels, what have you, in restrooms. And we do that for the customer. We make that investment on their behalf. And then again, we free them up to take care of their business, focus on their people, their customers, their guests, their patients. So, I'm sure that contributes to it. Certainly, when it's -- I think we've benefited from the environment where people are busy, and whether they're trying to hire people, take care of customers and they say, again, wow, I didn't realize you could do that for me, you can do it at those competitive rates, and that frees me up. And over the years, we've spoken to many, many customers who were surprised that our average-sized customer, how small it is. And they didn't realize that they were big enough to have a service like ours, where our average-sized customer is really small. And that's part of our responsibilities to get the message out, that we can help customers and our sales team out there actively pursuing those. But I've seen that over and over again throughout the years.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Got it. No, that's excellent color. Just last question for me. You talked about M&A being a bit more aggressive in this past year. I'm curious what your appetite would be to maybe more aggressively expand in the Fire and Safety or Fire and Security space. It's been a good vertical for you. I think it is an area or a market with a pretty considerable white space. So just curious your appetite within that vertical specifically.\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Stephanie, the way I would describe it is, again, we were able to invest more in M&A this year than going back all the way to fiscal '17. That being said, that is a byproduct of just timing, deal flow, when people make decisions. I wouldn't call it a change in strategy on our part. It was more about timing and flow. And that's tough to predict. As far as the First Aid and Safety Services and the Fire business, we're acquisitive in every single route-based business that we have. And so, we like to evaluate every single deal and make a good decision. In the Fire business specifically, we want to make sure that we're competitive and aggressive after good, attractive deals. The mix of business matters to us, meaning we like a business that meets the mix of test and inspect that we have and repair along with that as well. And there are some deals that have come across our desks that we have chosen not to participate in because there's a significant amount of installation in those businesses. And the installation business tends to be kind of tied to new construction. And that is really a very business and not one that's as attractive to us. It's tougher to staff, tougher -- it's kind of like bid and chase business. So, we've chosen to avoid those. But we really like both the -- all the route-based businesses. Again, we're highly acquisitive and would like to continue on that path.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared for closing remarks.\nJared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our first quarter of fiscal '25 financial results in September. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal '24 fourth quarter revenue was $2.47 billion compared to $2.28 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.5%. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.22 billion compared to $1.09 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 47.7% last year, an increase of 150 basis points. Strong growth from new customers and the penetration of existing customers with more products and services helped generate great operating leverage, aided by the performance of our global supply chain and focused efforts to extract inefficiencies from the business via our Six Sigma engineering teams as well as technologies like SmartTruck. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.91 billion compared to $1.77 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 7.1%. As we have done in the past, I will share revenue mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment for the fourth quarter. Keep in mind, there can be small fluctuations in mix between quarters. Uniform rental was 48%; dust was 19%; hygiene was 16%; shop towels were 4%; linen, which includes microfiber, wipes, towels and aprons, was 10%; and catalog revenue was 3%. These percentages are consistent with last year and demonstrate we are experiencing strong demand across all our products and services. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 48.6% compared to 47.7% last year. This 90 basis point improvement was the result of good top line growth that continue to generate great operating leverage and excellent sourcing and process improvements, which continue to create additional efficiencies such as garment sharing and SmartTruck. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the fourth quarter was $277.6 million compared to $249.8 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11.1%, capping off another year of double-digit organic growth. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 55.4% compared to 51% last year. This 440 basis point improvement was a result of our double-digit revenue growth that created solid operating leverage, an improved sales mix, a dedicated first aid distribution center that has lowered costs as well as efficiencies from our SmartTruck technology. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $282.1 million compared to $261.5 million last year. The Fire Protection revenue was $197.9 million, and the organic revenue growth rate was 12.9%, resulting in another year of double-digit organic growth. The Uniform Direct Sale revenue was $84.2 million, and organic revenue decreased 4.4%. The organic growth rate in Uniform Direct Sales can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Gross margin for Fire Protection Services was an all-time high of 50% compared to 47.9% last year. This 210 basis point improvement was primarily the result of robust revenue growth that generated strong operating leverage along with route productivity improvements. Gross margin for Uniform Direct Sales was 40.9% compared to 36% last year. This 490 basis point improvement was the result of higher margin accounts from a disciplined approach to the market. Fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was 27%, which was a 10 basis point improvement from last year. We were able to create leverage with these costs while continuing to invest in technology and selling resources. Fourth quarter operating income was $547.6 million compared to $470.8 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 22.2% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.6% in last year's fourth quarter. The fourth quarter marks the first time that all three operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and Fire Protection Services exceeded 22% in operating income in the same quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.4% compared to 22.4% last year. Net income for the fourth quarter was $414.3 million compared to $346.2 million last year. This year's fourth quarter diluted EPS was $3.99 compared to $3.33 last year, an increase of 19.8%. I'll now turn the call back over to Todd to provide his thoughts on next year and our financial expectations for fiscal '25. Andy, the short answer to are there any new headwinds, the short answer is no, with the exception of maybe the two fewer workdays where as you've heard us talk about, for example, in the first quarter, we talked a little bit about the top line impact being 160 basis points of growth headwind. But also, you've also heard us talk about margins. When we lose a workday, we've generally talked about a 50 basis point impact. We lose two workdays next year. We've done such a good job of leveraging our infrastructure that the loss of a workday in a quarter is probably more like 30 to 40 basis points now. But we lose two workdays, and so there'll be a little bit of headwind from that. That is just sort of a product of the calendar and not necessarily the business. Having said that, the business is still operating really well. And if you think about the -- we think about the guidance range is generally in the, you can call it, the 25% to 35% incremental margin range. And so, it is a pretty good margin range of the 30 basis points that you referred to, Andy. We would kind of say, look at the very bottom. There still is margin expansion at the very bottom of our range. At the top of the range, there's more than 30 basis points, probably more like 70 basis points. So, the year, we think this is a typical guide range for us. As you saw in our fourth quarter, the initiatives and the operational excellence that we have worked so hard on have continued in the fourth quarter. And given this guide, we expect those to continue into fiscal '25. And I might just add, Tim, to your question, probably not a lot of fiscal '25 to fiscal '24 year-over-year pricing change. Scott, I would say this, we don't like to put a ceiling on our aspirations, but we certainly think that we can continue to improve margins. And so maybe a couple of points. First of all, 25% to 35% incremental operating margins, we've got locations that are operating at the 30-plus level today. And so, we -- and that's in all of our businesses. And so, there is a pathway there and we are continuing to work on it. Sometimes it's better scale and density. Sometimes it's a little bit of product mix. Sometimes it's the newness of the location. But we have those examples, and we're continuing to get all of our locations closer and closer to those highest operating locations. And that incremental operating margin range of 25% to 35%, in our minds, tells us, certainly, we can work -- continue to work to get there. As you go back to the -- you've talked a little bit about technology. I would say that we're still in the early innings of technology. We've become much, much better at operating on the SAP system. And it's only been about four years since we've been -- since our rental business has been fully on and Fire is not on yet. And so, we have been getting better and better at using that system. But as you know, as we've talked about over the course of the last year or so, there are still a lot of things that can come with our Google and Verizon and SAP partnerships that we are just touching the surface on. And we think that can be a big driver of continued margin expansion into the future. Not ready to put a date on when we can hit 25% or 30%, but we certainly have that in our sights and we'll continue to work hard to get there. From a Fire Protection business perspective, we're still in the implementation phase of that. And there's going to be a little bit of pressure on there. I'm not going to give a specific guidance in terms of their margin. But there'll be some pressure as we go through, keeping in mind when we go through an implementation, there is the work of the implementation, the work of training all of our people to use it, the inefficiencies that come along with that, and we will then get better and better. And fiscal '25 is going to be a little bit of a year of that training and implementation period. And so, I would say that's going to be a little bit of pressure on the margins there. Certainly, that's incorporated within our overall guide of margin improvement. From a Uniform Direct Sale perspective, our margins have been really good. We've been working on selling the right types of programs, and our Uniform Direct Sale partners are doing a great job in that area. But having said all of that, a little bit hard to tell based on that SAP implementation in Fire, but keeping in mind that's included with our overall guide. Well, I'll say maybe this, Ashish. We had an 8% organic growth rate year this year, and that was a really good year in a year where, again, last year, we were at about 12.2% and 10% the previous year. And these were years where there was just heavy inflation. And as you know, our pricing was a little bit higher than norm. And we got the 8% this year in sort of that bringing the price increases back to something closer to historical levels. As we think about our guide, maybe I'll throw out a couple of numbers to you. And as Todd has been mentioning, we've had a -- we've not seen a lot of change in customer behavior. And we've had some really good performance in our full fiscal '24 year but I'll point out a couple. In our third quarter, if you adjust for the workdays, our total growth was 8.2%. In the fourth quarter, our total growth was 8.2%. In our guide, when you think about just simply the workday, our guide range is 6.7% to 8.3%. So, our guide range is effectively telling you we're seeing the business operate in much of the same manner as we saw in the second half of the year. If you look at the organic numbers in those -- in the third quarter, fourth quarter and next year, same story. And so, the philosophy is a little bit of, look, we have to build a bit of a range because we have to consider certain alternatives. But effectively, the guide range for fiscal '25 on the top line is right in line with what you've seen particularly in the second half of fiscal '24. And that is really nice growth in all of our businesses, certainly in Uniform Rental, First Aid and Safety, and Fire Protection. So hopefully, that helps a little bit, Ashish. Faiza, maybe I'll offer this a bit. If you think about the health care vertical that we've been in for maybe a decade or so now. When we got into that, we needed to create a sales team because it's just a different kind of sale, different kind of relationships. And so, we had to create a different kind of sales team. When we did that, we started with sort of maintenance uniforms, uniform rental and maintenance because we didn't have a broad product offering. As we continued in that business, we started to learn through dialogue with the customers how else we can help them, and we started things like microfiber and we started rental programs in microfiber. And that started to take off and has become a nice product for us. As we continued to have dialogue with them, that sort of evolved into then scrub rental programs. These came out of, again, dialogue with how can we help our customers. And so, this health care has grown from almost nothing to, call it, 8% of our revenue now. And it's largely because of the adaptation of our people to this new type of vertical, along with our dialogue with our customers and creating a real nice partnership, that then creates some innovation, that gets innovation flowing for us in new products and services. And then if we couple that with technology of having more information at our fingertips, of being able to find better prospecting. As we can better able to tell what customers have, which products and where might the warmest leads and so on be, over time, we have been able to grow the business and through that, grow the productivity. And so, all of these things that we do that Todd talks about, they don't happen overnight. They are the evolution and continued dialogue and collaboration with our customers to become more and more ingrained in what we do with them. And so, the -- you asked about the white space. This is just a continued evolution of that collaboration, innovation, technology wins, productivity improvement. We were about 4.3% in fiscal '24 as a percent of revenue. You might remember, we had a little bit of a catch-up in truck purchasing through the year. We had some of the SAP investment for Fire Protection. We largely believe that CapEx in the future is the 3.5% to 4% of revenue range. I think that's where we'll likely end up in fiscal '25."

            "content": "Thank you, Jared. Our fourth quarter performance marked a strong finish to another successful year for Cintas. Fourth quarter total revenue grew 8.2% to $2.47 billion, an all-time high for revenue in a quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.5%. And importantly, each of our businesses continue to perform well and execute at a high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was $1.22 billion, an increase of 11.6% over the prior year. Gross margin increased 150 basis points from 47.7% to 49.2%. Operating income for the fourth quarter of $547.6 million increased 16.3% over the prior year. Operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22.2% from 20.6% in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income was $414.3 million, an increase of 19.7%. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.99, an increase of 19.8% over the prior year fourth quarter. These results conclude a strong fiscal year marked by significant accomplishments, including robust revenue growth and margin expansion and excellent cash generation, which continue to fuel our balanced capital allocation strategy. The following are specific highlights of fiscal '24. I'd like to begin with revenue. Fiscal year revenue was a record $9.6 billion, an increase of 8.9%. Organic growth was 8% for the year. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time. Our top line growth is a function of the total value proposition we offer customers of all sizes and across industries and unique Cintas culture that drives our partners to deliver an outstanding customer experience. Business across our focused verticals of health care, hospitality, education, and state and local government continue to perform well. We experienced strong demand for our services not only from existing customers but across our new business pipeline. About two-third of our new customers continue to come from no-programmers, underscoring our ability to capitalize on the vast growth opportunity that remains ahead. In addition, our retention rates remain strong. Our strong revenue performance also translated into continued growth in profits and earnings, including the following highlights. Fiscal '24 operating income grew 14.8% for the year, and our operating margin of 21.6% was an all-time high. EPS grew 16.6% for the year. Our enhanced profitability and earnings growth is a reflection of our relentless focus on operational excellence in every aspect of our business, spanning strategic sourcing and supply chain initiatives, route and energy optimization opportunities with SmartTruck, and leveraging the SAP system to support greater stockroom visibility and efficient garment sharing. Our cash flow from operating activities exceeded $2 billion for the first time. Strong cash generation provides us even greater flexibility to deploy capital across each of our capital allocation priorities throughout the year. Our number one capital allocation priority is investing back in the business. We prioritize investments in technology, infrastructure, and people to support our sustained growth and value creation over the long term. As we continue to grow and create value, capital is required to add capacity in a number of ways, including new facilities, new equipment, new vehicles as well as technologies to make our partners more successful. We spent $186.8 million in fiscal '24 on acquisitions. This is the most we've spent on acquisitions since fiscal '17. We love acquisitions as they provide us with new customers where we can offer a broader range of products and services. Sometimes they can bring needed capacity that can also bring attractive synergies that involve leveraging our existing route structures, providing more time with customers and less time driving. Another of our priorities is returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In fiscal '24, we increased our quarterly per share dividend by 17.4%, marking the 40th consecutive year that we've increased our dividend, including every year since going public. We also bought back $1 billion of shares during fiscal '24 and up through yesterday. Lastly, we were named to the prestigious Fortune 500 for the eighth consecutive year. It is an honor to be recognized among the most successful and respected companies. We're proud of these results and the value we continue to deliver for the Cintas shareholders. That performance reflects the focus and great execution by our employees whom we call partners. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our fourth quarter results. Thank you, Mike. As we move into fiscal '25, we expect to exceed $10 billion in annual revenue for the first time. This outlook, coupled with our strong fiscal '24 results, demonstrate that our value proposition continues to resonate. Every business in North America, goods-producing or services-providing, has a need for image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance. We help our customers meet those needs so they can focus on running their businesses. As we deliver on our customers' needs, our culture remains our greatest competitive advantage, and it drives our focus on continuous improvement and evolving for the future. We will continue to prioritize investments in technology, infrastructure, and people. Our technology investments include our continued investment in SAP with our Fire division currently going through the implementation process. In addition to SAP, we have partnered with Verizon and Google to deploy technology solutions that make it easier for our partners to run their business and easier for our customers to do business with us. In addition, technology initiatives such as SmartTruck and garment sharing are helping to drive customer satisfaction as well as efficiencies throughout the organization. Our working partners really are the key to our success. We know that when we take care of our partners, they will, in turn, take great care of our customers. We are investing in training our partners and giving them the best and latest tools to make their jobs easier while also investing in talent acquisition in order to ensure we are properly staffed to support our growth initiatives. The future of Cintas remains bright, and our fiscal '25 guidance reflects that outlook. For fiscal '25, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $10.16 billion to $10.31 billion, a total growth rate of 5.9% to 7.4%. Please note the following: fiscal '25 will have two fewer workdays compared to fiscal '24. Each quarter of fiscal '25 will have 65 workdays. The two fewer workdays will impact the first and fourth quarters by one day each. The revenue growth rate in each of those two quarters will be negatively affected by about 160 basis points. Please keep that in mind when modeling. Adjusting for the impact of two fewer workdays, acquisitions already completed and at constant currency, our total organic growth rate for next year is expected to be 6.4% to 8%. We expect diluted EPS to be in the range of $16.25 to $16.75, a growth rate of 7.3% to 10.6%. Fiscal '25 net interest expense is expected to be approximately $106 million compared to $95 million in fiscal '24, predominantly as a result of higher variable rate debt used to complete a portion of the previously mentioned share buybacks. Our fiscal '25 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.4%, the same compared to our fiscal '24. Guidance does not include any future share buybacks or significant economic disruptions or downturns. I want to end by thanking our partners for their tremendous efforts to achieve a successful fiscal '24. As we look ahead to fiscal '25, our outlook reflects our continued confidence in our strategy. We remain focused on delivering outstanding customer experiences, reinforcing the unique Cintas culture that drives our success while making the necessary investments in the business to sustain our growth through fiscal '25 and long beyond. I'll now turn the call back over to Jared. Thanks for your comments. We really haven't seen a change in our customer behavior. As I mentioned, our retention rates are still at very attractive levels. And when you have as broad of a customer base as we do, there are certainly some aspects that are doing -- that are thriving and some that are struggling. It varies based upon industry. It varies based upon geography. But when you speak as a whole, I would say our customer base is -- we haven't seen much change in it so far. Well, Josh, we really like where we -- our guide is. We like where our business is. And that's where we -- that's kind of where we target our business to grow at those types of levels. Certainly, we read the overall macro data that we -- that you all read about what's going on in the economy. So, we watch that. But we don't expect much change at this point. And as a result, I'd say we expect to be right in that guide. We'd love for the economy to go even faster. But nevertheless, we find ways to be successful. Our value proposition is resonating. We have -- we service a little over 1 million customers or 16 million businesses in our market, and we have all kinds of ways to grow. And I think we've shown that we have the ability to exceed GDP growth and exceed employment growth. So, we would certainly love for our customers to be thriving and adding people all over the place. But nevertheless, we're going to find a way to be successful and we're confident in our guide. Well, I'll start, Heather. As we think about margin expansion, and our guide reflects margin expansion with the first item we think about as it comes to that is leverage, leverage on revenue growth. And we've demonstrated that we have the ability to do that, and we'll continue to do that. And that's easy to say, hard to do, but the team has done an incredible job in so many areas, starting with our global supply chain, which is a competitive advantage in the marketplace. How they go about their jobs, the fact that they have dual source or many sources for 90% or more of the products that we source, so how they go about that. The great work that's been done on material costs, again, starting with sourcing. But also, we leverage our SAP system to help us to improve our garment sharing. And we've been working on this for years and it's bearing fruit not only in our cost structure but also in turnaround time for our customers. So, it helps us to get product to our customers faster when it's in our stockrooms versus having to order new out of our distribution centers. Better for our customers, better for our financials, and that's paying off for us. Andy, here's what I'll tell you is that we operate in a highly competitive market. Always have, always will. I'm sure. I've been with the Company for 35 years. It's been competitive every day since I've been here. Now that being said, our revenue retention rates, as I mentioned, are attractive. And part of it is because our new business wins tend to come from the no-program market and less from the competition. So, as I mentioned earlier, there's 16 million businesses out there. We service about 1 million. So, the white space out there is incredible. And we're focused on converting those folks from, I'll call it, a do-it-yourself type to a customer of ours. And that value proposition is resonating because we help them focus on taking care of their customers or their patients or their guests or whatever, however you want to describe it, and we take that for them. And we're able to do it better, faster, smarter and, in many cases, cheaper than what they were doing it. So yes, is it competitive? Heck yes. It's always been competitive and we're focused on growing the market and that's been a good model for us. Yes, we really like the verticals that we've chosen. And as a reminder, it's not just a sales strategy. It is also how we organize around those customers, those industries, those verticals to make sure that we're meeting, exceeding their needs because they're a little different. And as we do that, the products, the services that we provide, the support that we provide all comes along with that. And so yes, they're all operating at attractive levels. And I wouldn't call anyone out specifically where I'd say, oh my gosh, that one's exceeding. They're all doing quite well. I thought it might be helpful to talk a little bit about a recent health care win that we had. We recently sold a large hospital network with scrub dispensing technology for the scrubs in the various departments throughout an acute care hospital. But we're also having really good success with surgery centers and those types that are attached to the large acute care hospital networks. And you're probably seeing some of that acute care hospital networks having investments in other areas. So, in fact, I'd say three large health care systems came to us for help with their non-acute facilities. When I say non-acute facilities, I'm talking about really surgery centers, clinics, physician offices, those types. And they came to us and said, \"You're doing a great job for acute care. Can you help us with the non-acute?\" And what does that do for them? It allows them to have a consistent supply but also allows them to consolidate vendors. So, we're seeing good success certainly in health care. But the other verticals are all performing well. And we like the decisions, the investments that we've made in those areas, and we think they're going to continue to pay dividends for us. So, I'd say nothing to call out specifically there. It's still really a normal operating environment. As I mentioned earlier, we operate in a highly competitive market. So, we've got to make sure that we're -- our value proposition is resonating with our customers and we're providing outstanding customer service. We've said that our plan is to lower pricing back towards historical levels and that's what we're seeing. And I would just point out that as we've moderated pricing, even in fiscal '24, we were able to expand operating margins 120 basis points. And so, we're finding ways to provide great value for our customers while moderating pricing but still extracting inefficiencies out of our business so that we can improve operating margins. Tim, we've -- as I mentioned, it's a highly competitive market. We have continued to moderate pricing. And pricing is a local subject. It really depends upon the customers, what their operating environment's like, what their customer base is doing, those types. So, we continue to monitor that and manage it appropriately based upon our local businesses and making sure that we're meeting our customers' needs and thinking about the long-term value of a customer because we don't look at it and say, we're focused on the near term or in the short term. We're focused on the long term for our customers, and we'll continue to manage pricing in that manner. Just to clarify, moderating pricing is the way you characterized it, which is we are passing through modest price increases based upon our agreement and relationship with that customer. And that varies based upon customers, geographies, industries, et cetera. But yes, the way you described it is appropriate. It's a modest price increase with customers in general. That would be correct. Yes, it really varies. As I mentioned, we have such a broad customer base in geographies but really not much change in customer behavior when it comes to hiring. We're seeing a pretty -- the environment is, I'll call it, stable and hasn't really changed much in the past few quarters. Well, here's the way I'd describe it is we operate in a really competitive environment. And so, we're out there trying to do the best to take care of our customers fighting for business every day. And I wouldn't characterize it as really much of a change in the environment. It's always really competitive. And we're continuing to try to position our organization with the best products, the best services, the best technology so that they can be successful in the marketplace. As you know, M&A, it's tough to predict. We think about it long term and make sure that we have relationships so that when someone does decide that they want to transact, that we're well positioned. So, it's really tough to predict deal flow. But again, we think about long term, and we want to be -- we find M&A really attractive and in large part because of, as I mentioned earlier, it gives us a new set of customers that we can offer a wider breadth of products and services that we offer. There can be highly attractive synergies. In many cases, we get some infrastructure that is important to us. And we always get great people and we learn from those. So yes, we're highly interested in M&A of all shapes and sizes and we're active in those markets. Tough to pace it. It takes two to dance. And we just want to make sure we're at the dance and ready. It's tough to put a number on that. It's kind of like, how do you put a value on the culture of Cintas? We're constantly reinvesting in those technologies, in those trainings to position our people to be more successful. We talk about making it easier for them to do their jobs and make it easier for our customers to do business with us. So those are all investments that are long-term thinking, long-term investments that positions our people to be successful in the marketplace. Some of those investments pay off faster but it's a continual investment. And when we think about those investments, it is -- we have an amazing team of partners that are out every day taking great care of the customers. We want to make it easier for them. And we want to make it -- give them data that allows them to provide more value to the customers, make it less laborious for them to do their jobs and allow customers the ability to self-serve and have many conduits to do business with Cintas and also communicate with Cintas. So, all those investments are ongoing and will be, frankly, probably ongoing in perpetuity because that's the nature of business now that technology plays a key role. And we're blessed to have a balance sheet where we can invest appropriately and position our team to be really successful. I'll start, and Mike, if you'd like to contribute. Faiza, good morning, and for several decades now, we have had a focus on trying to grow the pie of the business, and that white space is significant. So, we teach our organization about how to attract no-programmers. And it's a little different process. And it takes -- it's more of a conceptual sell versus something, I'll call it, more about -- well, you've got to coach them and teach them about how to do something different instead of simply doing it yourself. And again, that's a conceptual sell and we teach our folks on how to do that. And we happen to be blessed with being in a spot where there is a massive white space out there. And I'll say it's a harder concept to get across to people. But we've been doing it for so long that it's just part of how our organization operates. And we think that's exciting for us. No real obvious change I would point to. It's just part of our culture. It's part of how we teach and train our partners on how to approach that. And it resonates with people because they get the concept of outsourcing. They get the concept of, yes, maybe I am struggling to keep up with all this. And you can do it, you can do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper than I can. And that's been a key fundamental of how we've grown our business over the years and how we'll continue to grow our business into the future. Yes, there's many inputs to it. Certainly, if you are with a rental uniform program, if you want to buy garments, there's a large capital outlay versus us doing that for the customer, and other areas where you might have to go buy dispensers for chemicals or soaps, towels, what have you, in restrooms. And we do that for the customer. We make that investment on their behalf. And then again, we free them up to take care of their business, focus on their people, their customers, their guests, their patients. So, I'm sure that contributes to it. Certainly, when it's -- I think we've benefited from the environment where people are busy, and whether they're trying to hire people, take care of customers and they say, again, wow, I didn't realize you could do that for me, you can do it at those competitive rates, and that frees me up. And over the years, we've spoken to many, many customers who were surprised that our average-sized customer, how small it is. And they didn't realize that they were big enough to have a service like ours, where our average-sized customer is really small. And that's part of our responsibilities to get the message out, that we can help customers and our sales team out there actively pursuing those. But I've seen that over and over again throughout the years. Yes. Stephanie, the way I would describe it is, again, we were able to invest more in M&A this year than going back all the way to fiscal '17. That being said, that is a byproduct of just timing, deal flow, when people make decisions. I wouldn't call it a change in strategy on our part. It was more about timing and flow. And that's tough to predict. As far as the First Aid and Safety Services and the Fire business, we're acquisitive in every single route-based business that we have. And so, we like to evaluate every single deal and make a good decision. In the Fire business specifically, we want to make sure that we're competitive and aggressive after good, attractive deals. The mix of business matters to us, meaning we like a business that meets the mix of test and inspect that we have and repair along with that as well. And there are some deals that have come across our desks that we have chosen not to participate in because there's a significant amount of installation in those businesses. And the installation business tends to be kind of tied to new construction. And that is really a very business and not one that's as attractive to us. It's tougher to staff, tougher -- it's kind of like bid and chase business. So, we've chosen to avoid those. But we really like both the -- all the route-based businesses. Again, we're highly acquisitive and would like to continue on that path."

Due to the outstanding dedication and execution of our employees, whom we call partners, we delivered very strong results for our third quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter grew 9.9% to $2.41 billion. The revenue dollars represent record quarterly revenue. We are pleased with the performance of each of our businesses. Our revenue growth remains robust and we have good momentum in the business. New business remains strong. Our sales team continues to operate at a high level. We are seeing broad success across the many verticals, particularly within our focus verticals, as well as our cross-selling efforts and penetration of new products and services within our existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels. Our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the third quarter increased 220 basis points to a record 49.4%, an increase of 14.9%. Operating income was a record 21.6%, an increase of 16.6%. Diluted EPS grew a robust 22.3% to $3.84. Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter grew 32.8% over the prior year. In the third quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses through capital expenditures of $107 million. During the third quarter, we made acquisition purchases of $111 million. On March 15th, we paid shareholders $137.6 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid the previous March. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital and through three quarters, we have deployed over $1.4 billion of capital across our priorities of capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, and buybacks. I would like to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third-quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion to a range of $9.57 billion to $9.6 billion, a total growth rate of 8.6% to 8.9%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14.35 to $14.65, to a range of $14.80 to $15, a growth rate of 13.9% to 15.5%. Mike?\nMike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue was $2.41 billion, compared to $2.19 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and a difference in the number of workdays was 7.7%. Total growth was positively impacted by 170 basis points due to the extra workday. We remind you, as you update your models for next fiscal year that there will be two less workdays compared to this current fiscal year. Each quarter next year will have 65 workdays, which means, the first and the fourth quarters will each have one less workday than this fiscal year. Organic growth by business was 7.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 11.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 13.9% for Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale was down 3.9%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.19 billion, compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 14.9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.4% for the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 47.2% last year, an increase of 220 basis points. Strong volume growth, technology improvements, and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 56.3% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 41.1% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 170 basis points from last year. Energy was a tailwind of 40 basis points. In addition, we continue to leverage our strong revenue growth, our technology investments and extract inefficiencies out of the business through our Six Sigma and engineering teams. Our technology investments have allowed us to improve garment sharing among our plants, which improves material cost. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide route densities to our existing routes, which positively impacts truck purchasing, labor, and energy. Our Six Sigma and engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our plant equipment, labor, and energy. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 470 basis points from last year. Strong revenue growth continues to help expand our margins in this segment. Strong revenue performance in some of our high-margin recurring revenue products like AED Rentals, eyewash stations, and WaterBreak continues to provide a healthy revenue mix. Our technology investment in SmartTruck continues to provide route optimization and improved efficiencies. And our First Aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contributed to improved gross margins. Selling and administrative expenses increased 90 basis points from last year. The increase was driven by investments in selling resources, technology and our management trainee program, as well as costs associated with an agreement in principle to settle the purported class action contract dispute brought by plaintiffs City of Laurel. We determined that settling the claim is in the best interest of Cintas. The total monetary payment agreed to in the proposed settlement, including the 60 basis points recognized in this quarter is $45 million. We expect that the settlement costs will not impact our financials in future periods. As Todd mentioned earlier, we generated strong cash flow. For the year, our free cash flow increased 31.6%. This has allowed us to invest back into the business, which has resulted in capital expenditures of 4.3% for the year. Our investments include technology to grow the top line and expand margins, automation to improve efficiencies in our plants and additional processing capacity where needed. We expect capital expenditures to finish around 4.25% of revenue for the year. Operating income of $520.8 million compared to $446.8 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.6% in the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.4% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the third quarter was $397.6 million compared to $325.8 million last year. This year's third-quarter diluted EPS of $3.84 compared to $3.14 last year, an increase of 22.3%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $99 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.6%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23. Our guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, we expect that the proposed settlement will not impact our financials in future periods and accordingly, there is no impact on our guidance. Guidance includes $17.4 million of acquired revenue for the fourth quarter. This revenue includes the impact of the recently announced acquisitions during the third quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, Manav.\nRonan Kennedy: Hi, good morning. This is Ronan Kennedy on for Manav. Thank you for taking my questions. Can I just ask, with regards to the strong margin performance, can you kind of assess or characterize the contributions from, whether it's the SmartTruck, the Six Sigma, the engineering extracting of inefficiencies? But also how we should think about those as drivers in the context of the sustainability of the margins, if you could elaborate on that, please?\nTodd Schneider: Thank you for your question, Ronan. It's -- when you think about the gross margin, it really starts with our culture, how we run our business, the expectations we have, the intensity of which we run it, and the focus. That being said, there's many, many inputs to those numbers. Certainly, our investments that we are making are paying off. The investments in SmartTruck, the investments in our Six Sigma team, the investment in our engineering team, the investment in our supply chain organization are all helping us to improve those results. So I can't give you an exact number with, hey, SmartTruck gave us X basis points, what have you. It's -- there's many inputs, and we're pleased with the investments that we've made, and we're pleased with the leadership and the culture of the organization, where they're focused on driving those results, providing a better experience for our customers and providing a better experience for our employee-partners.\nRonan Kennedy: That's helpful. Thank you. And then with regards to obviously, strong performance on the top line as well, can you just talk about the contributions from new business and penetration versus expectations, how pricing is trending, and also retention, please?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, good question. So when we think about our growth, again, there's many contributing factors. We really like where we are from a growth standpoint, the internal growth, certainly we like the acquisitions that we've made. They're really good businesses. But when we think about the components of it, certainly pricing is a component, but it is not the majority. The majority of our growth is from volume growth. And that's really pleasing to us because we want to be able to grow our business in that manner. Pricing is -- has moderated and it's much closer to historical, and that's exactly what we had planned throughout the year. Where we're really benefiting is from our new business. Our team is performing at a high level. Our service organization is -- the retention levels are very attractive. And then we are cross-selling appropriately. We have a great breadth of products and services that we want to make sure that our customers and our prospects are aware of. And so we're benefiting kind of across all, not kind of, we are benefiting across all of those areas, and they're all big contributing factors, but we like where we are and we like how we're growing the business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Joshua.\nJoshua Chan: Hi. Good morning, Todd and Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you talk about the -- I guess, piggybacking on the prior question, could you talk about the sustainability of growth that you're seeing now that the pricing has moderated to a historical level? Do you see the current run rate staining based on what you're seeing out there, talking to customers and retention rate dynamics, and all that?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Josh, good morning. Again, we like where we are from a growth standpoint. The exciting thing is there's -- we service a little over a million customers. There's 16 million businesses in North America, so we're -- we think there's an incredible runway for us. So we're selling to -- about 60% of our new accounts come from no programmers, and that is continuing. So we're seeing great results from talking to prospects and showing them a better way to do it than they are today. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that, that is new spend. They might be spending that money somehow. It's just we're redirecting it to do it better, smarter, faster, in some cases, even less expensive than the way they're doing it. So we think the runway is very attractive because of the number of prospects that are out there and our business -- or, excuse me, our buying proposition resonating with prospects and customers. So, we expect that we like where we are from a growth standpoint. As I mentioned, we like how we're growing and we want to continue in that manner.\nJoshua Chan: That's great color. Thank you. And for my follow-up, you talked about incremental margins being in the 20% to 30% range historically, and now you're sort of at the higher end of that in recent years. Is this the right level of incremental margins going forward on revenue growth that comes ahead?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. So we're -- we recognize the math of 20% to 30% incremental margins. We need to be the higher end of that in order to continue to improve our margins and we're focused on doing that. We're doing so by extracting out those inefficiencies, getting really good leverage on our revenue growth, so many ways. But running a business is not linear. And so, we know there's going to be some puts and takes and some quarters will be higher and some won't be as high. But generally speaking, we like that range. And I prefer the higher end than the lower end, that's for sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could just talk about the M&A you did this quarter and what attracted you to the assets. And then an update on how to think about M&A going forward.\nTodd Schneider: I'm certainly happy to start, Mike. Regarding -- Heather, good morning. And regarding M&A, so it's an important component for us. You certainly cannot pace M&A. So they kind of come as they do, and it takes two to dance. And -- but I can tell you the two that we announced this past quarter are great businesses first off, really good operators, really attractive businesses. In the case of the one in Kentucky, it provided us with some needed capacity in that region of the country. In addition to the added capacity, we were able to absorb that volume into seven of our facilities. So some really nice synergies allows us to, as we're closer to the customers, to spend more time with the customer and less time driving. So that's important to us. In the case of the acquisition in the M&A in Pennsylvania, we did not acquire any additional capacity. But in that case, we were able to absorb it into 16 of our facilities. So again, attractive synergies, more time with the customer, less time driving. And in those cases, we also then get to talk to our new customers about the broader breadth of products and services that we have. So we think it's -- overall it's very attractive. As I mentioned, it takes two to dance. You can't pace it. But in this case, these were two really attractive businesses, great operators that really made sense for us.\nMike Hansen: Maybe a couple added points. As Todd said, these are great acquisitions, and we've had a handful of them this fiscal year. Each of the two that Todd talked about is less than $20 million in annual revenue. The $17.4 million that we gave you in our prepared remarks includes the impact of those. But keeping in mind, we've made acquisitions all year long, and so that fourth quarter impact would include all of the acquisitions we've made throughout the last 12 months. Just something to keep in mind as you're thinking about our fourth quarter.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from RW Baird. Please go ahead, Andy. Hello, Andy. Is your line muted?\nAndy Wittmann: I'm sorry about that. Mike, I just want to build on that last question where you were commenting on the M&A contribution. Is there any -- in your fourth quarter guidance, is there a change in your fundamental outlook for the company, recognizing that it is up now somewhat on these two -- somewhat larger acquisitions that you did? And then as an addendum to that, was this 60 basis points or $45 million legal settlement that you just talked about, was that included and considered in your initial guidance? Or are you absorbing that and still able to raise your guidance here?\nMike Hansen: Yeah. So, Andy, I already forgot your first part of the question. What was your first part?\nAndy Wittmann: First question is, does your fundamental outlook for the business unchanged?\nMike Hansen: Yeah, yeah.\nAndy Wittmann: Is your fundamental outlook unchanged for 4Q or is there a change\u2026\nMike Hansen: Yeah. I apologize. No, as Todd talked about, our market remains very large, the momentum in the business remains good, the adoption remains good, and the guide for the fourth quarter is right where we want to be in terms of sort of the stated profile of growth that we want to have. And so, all of that put together with not really any change in customer behavior would mean, no, continued performance like we've seen, and we continue to like the momentum of the business. As it relates to your second question, the 60 basis points, that was not contemplated in the initial guide from the beginning of the year and that was simply absorbed through -- well, in this third quarter, the 60 basis points simply absorbed.\nAndy Wittmann: Okay, thank you. That's all my questions for today.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you provide an update on the external selling environment, including how client budgets and sales cycles are performing?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, I'm certainly happy to start. George, good morning. We haven't really seen much of a change in sales cycle as far as our -- the interest in our products and services remains good. We're always continuing -- we're continuing to invest in new products and services. Tweaks, I guess, certainly to them to make it as attractive to the prospects and the customers as possible. But we're not seeing a change. Momentum continues to be good. Outsourcing still resonates and we're seeing, as I mentioned earlier, the no program market is still really, really large. And we've become pretty darn proficient at presenting to those prospects to help them run a better business. And we help them with all the products and services we provide. And as I mentioned, it's not always new money. Usually they're spending something. It's just redirecting it to us to do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper type thing.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then separately, can you talk a little bit about your focus verticals, including healthcare, how much additional runway is there for these focus verticals to serve as a tailwind to organic revenue growth?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. So, George, so it's in our internal growth. So it is helping us -- that focus is helping us to organize around the customer and provide the products and services that they want. And that has been a good strategy for us over the past number of years. So we like all the verticals we're in. We find them very attractive. Whether it's healthcare, hospitality, education, state, local government, business, it's all attractive and we're organized around it and our value proposition is resonating with them.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.\nLuke McFadden: Hi, good morning. This is Luke McFadden on for Tim Mulrooney. Thanks for taking our questions today. So I wanted to ask, too, just on first date, I'll start with the first one and then move on to the second one after. But First Aid and Safety has been growing at a double digit rate for quite a few quarters in a row now. I know there's a penetration story here with your established base of uniform customers, but I'm also curious if new product introductions are an important driver of this growth. How much of your growth in that segment is from new product introductions?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Luke. We really like the First Aid business. Part of our culture is continued innovation. So we're always looking at improving our -- improving our processes, improving our products, improving our services, so it's always a component. I cannot give you a number of, hey, it was X basis points of growth due to a product rollout or what have you, but I can tell you this. The value proposition in the First Aid business and all of our businesses, but in First Aid, as you asked about, it's really resonating. And the mix of business that we have there is really good. And we're able to be better sourcers, better providers of products with our investment and our distribution center. So when you have a robust supply chain that allows us to get products to the customers in a really timely fashion, it puts us in a great spot to be successful. And so yeah, cross-sell, we're absolutely, we want all of our customers, whether they're uniform or fire or direct sale customer, we want them all to know about our First Aid business. And we try to make sure that that occurs in many different conduits, but it's, yeah, we're benefiting from that cross-sell.\nLuke McFadden: Understood, really helpful, and maybe just sticking on first aid and safety here. As you think about that segment of your business, does it feel like you've essentially built out the full suite of products and services there, or at some point should we expect that potentially you're more about other product introductions as you continue to build out the portfolio? Because the room here for more is essentially what I'm curious to know.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Luke, yeah, again, I'll go back to our culture. Our culture is such that we are constantly innovating and pushing ourselves to be the -- to provide the best products and services. And so you'll see more of that to come. We're constantly innovating to put our partners in the best position, our employee partners in the best position to provide the most value for our customers.\nMike Hansen: And maybe one added comment Luke, when we think about this business, you may have heard us speak to umbrellas of image, safety, cleanliness and compliance and when we think about this business, safety is a fairly large umbrella and when our first aid and safety people are speaking with customers and thinking about that innovation that Todd talked about, we're thinking quite broadly about how do we keep our customers, how do we help our customers keep their employees safe. And that can mean opportunities into the future. And that's the way we look at it from a broad perspective.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. In the quarter, when you look at your rentals and facility services segment, how much of the growth is actually coming from uniforms versus ancillary services directionally? Like, is there good growth in both? And also if you can make a comment about ad stops within uniforms.\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Andrew. As you know, we don't give out those specific numbers, but directionally to your question, yeah, we're seeing growth across them at all. It's -- there's good demand for our uniform business and our facility services business, frankly for all of our business products and services. So, nothing to point out to one particular area there. As far as ad stops, we haven't really seen a change to our customer behavior there. So, it\u2019s -- I'll call it kind of business as usual. There's many inputs to that number, but nevertheless, I'd say it's kind of business as usual.\nAndrew Steinerman: Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Yes, sir.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper.\nJasper Bibb: Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on the earlier discussion on first aid. The gross margin there was really impressive at 56% this quarter, but you also had SG&A at 25% from the prior year. So, could you provide just maybe a bit of color on the investments you're making in that business? And when do you think the first aid segment should start to deliver a bit more margin leverage over that G&A base?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Jasper, good morning. As I mentioned, we really like the business and it's performing really well and we're investing appropriately. The amount of prospects out there are massive. And to Mike's point earlier, the value proposition is resonating. We talk about the mantra in that business is what's more important to a business than the health and safety of their employees and their customers. So that is resonating. We're in a great position to invest to provide those products and services. So we're doing just that. And so we're investing in selling resources, we're investing in marketing resources, because we really like where we are and it makes sense to invest. And I think you're seeing it show up in the operating margin and the gross margin.\nMike Hansen: Yeah, we've -- each quarter this year has been 22% or higher, which is quite a big improvement from a year ago. And so, as Todd said, these -- and we want to continue to invest in the long-term growth of all of our businesses. And you can really see those investments playing out, particularly in the gross margin line of first aid and safety. But we love the margins. They're up quite a bit over the last few years. And we'll continue to invest as we see appropriate.\nJasper Bibb: Thanks, that makes sense. And then just was hoping to get an update on what you're seeing for expense growth on labor and fleet related costs in the quarter?\nTodd Schneider: Jasper, good question. Certainly, labor is an important component. We want to make sure that we're providing attractive wages, competitive wages. And we've spoken on previous calls that we were not flat-footed when it came to the wage inflation that I'd say North America has seen over the past few years. So we've been in a good position and we like where we are from that perspective. And here's what's really exciting, is we have, I mentioned earlier, our Six Sigma teams, our engineering teams, they're helping us to automate certain items to bring transformation technology to portions of our business, whether it's SmartTruck or plant efficiencies, that allows us to mitigate that subject as best as possible. And so we're investing and have invested for years in those organizations and it's paying off in -- and what we're seeing with our total labor costs as we manage through and make sure we're still in a really good spot to be a competitive and attract the very best people.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the Google partnership. I was wondering if you can provide an update on that front. I believe you've already migrated your SAP onto the GCP. And how should we think about those benefits that you may have seen in the quarter, but also benefits as we go forward? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Good question, Ashish. I would characterize -- well, first off, we have a great relationship with Google. You're correct, we did migrate to the Google Cloud platform and I would characterize it as we're in the early innings there. And so we certainly hope to maximize our relationship and put our employee partners in a position to provide more value and to be as successful as possible. Because we believe there's tools that will be available to us to provide more value to the customers and to put our people in a better position to provide that value which makes them more successful. So early innings, but we're optimistic about where that can go.\nAshish Sabadra: That's a very helpful color. And if I can ask a quick accounting clarifying question. So in the balance sheet, the uniform and other rental items and service that's moderated sequentially quarter to quarter, I was just wondering if you can provide any color on what's driving that, is that better efficiency or any color on that front? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Yes. Todd talked a little bit about how we are working on all pieces of the business, but certainly one of those is inventory, and he touched on a little bit of garment sharing. So you can think about when we improve garment sharing, for example, we don't need to inject as many new garments into that in-service inventory. So the more sharing means better utilization of our existing in-service inventory, and it means we don't have to add as much into the in-service inventory from new purchases. That's one of the areas. Certainly, though, there are others like improved sourcing as well. Volume growth, as Todd said, remains really strong, and so what we're seeing is some nice offsetting of the volume growth with some of these initiatives.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to continue the discussion on the pretty impressive margin front for the quarter. I appreciate the color in terms of kind of discussing the route optimization, the merchandise management, Six Sigma, the likes. But maybe if you could provide a little bit of color of your major initiatives, which ones you think are kind of still in the early innings, or we could kind of continue to see some more improvement or accelerated improvement? And then maybe taking it a step further, what is next for you guys, in terms of other areas of opportunity that haven't been as major focused yet? Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Stephanie. From our strategic initiatives that we're focused on how can we impact our business in total, certainly our material costs, our energy, our labor. And Mike referred to earlier, our energy spend is down 40 basis points. That's not all just price. That is, those initiatives that we referred to earlier, the material cost is -- our two largest costs are material costs and labor. So we're very focused on driving efficiencies in all those areas, because to Mike's earlier point, we love the volume growth, but we don't want to sacrifice margin because the volume growth is so robust that we've got these strategic initiatives to extract these inefficiencies out of our business. And I wouldn't speak to any one in particular that it's in the earlier innings or the others. We've got a nice runway forward for doing that. A little bit of that is our culture, is that we're constantly trying to innovate and push ourselves to be better. So I think you'll see that continued. As far as acceleration, it's built in. We're constantly doing it. So I think we're focused on those incremental margins and this is an important component of making sure that we can hit those numbers.\nMike Hansen: Yeah, the only thing I might add is we're certainly in the very early innings of technology and we believe there's a nice runway there. Todd talked about just the recent migration to the Google Cloud and that creates a foundation for us to do some interesting things moving forward.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Well, thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, it's [Daniel] (ph) on for Scott. Thanks for taking our question. Could you please speak to the outlook for uniform direct sales and fire protection as well as some perspective on the margins for all others going forward please? Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: I'll start on the outlook and, Mike, if you want to speak to the margins. The uniform direct sale business is strategic business for us. We have some really large strategic accounts, whether it's national accounts or in the hospitality, gaming area of our business. And so strategic meaning that those customers spend a lot more money with us not just with garment direct sale but also outside of that. So that's important. That being said, that business certainly can be a little lumpy due to the nature of it with rollouts and purchases. But we like where we're positioned there. We like the value proposition that we're -- where we are there. So we think the outlook's very positive there. As far as the fire business, it's been a great business for us. The results over the last several years, we've seen great revenue growth, we've seen great margin improvement, and it's the only business we're in where you legally have to have those products and services. So we think it\u2019s -- the outlook is really positive because of the prospects that are out there and the runway we see for opportunity. So, Mike, if you want to comment on margin.\nMike Hansen: Sure. So as Todd said, the fire business in particular, the margins have increased quite a bit in the last handful of years, and we've seen a lot of the same initiatives and other initiatives specific to that business really take off like we've seen in our other businesses. The one thing I might point out there, we did see some increase in SG&A and the fire business year-over-year, and we're starting to get into that SAP implementation for the fire business. So we might see a little bit of pressure as we move into fiscal \u201825 on the fire margins, the overall margins because of that investment and that move. But as you've seen with our rental and first aid and safety businesses, once we understand how to use that and get proficient at it, it can create some really nice opportunities. So maybe a little bit of -- we've seen some great improvement, maybe a little bit of next year and the following year pressure on SG&A because of that implementation, but we certainly expect those margins to continue to improve in the longer term. From a uniform direct sale margin perspective, as Todd said, that business is going to go up and down. It's going to be a little bit bumpy from quarter to quarter. And because of that, the margins will be as well. So I don't think there's anything specific to call out other than it isn't quite as consistent of a business as the other three that we have.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead Shlomo.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Todd, can you talk a little bit about the macro environment with regard to employment? And specifically if you could touch up on some of the areas where they're looking for more automation to reduce the employment due to raises in minimum wage in areas like California, are you -- how exposed are you to those kind of verticals? And then after that, I have a follow up.\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Shlomo. Yeah, from a macro environment, as I mentioned, we haven't seen much change in our customer behavior. Certainly there is always some puts and takes. And as you mentioned, our employer is under pressure to figure out ways to automate things because wage inflation, that has occurred and will continue to occur, it's occurred for many, many years. Now there's also some -- the infrastructure bills that are out there, the on-shoring. I can't speak to specifics of, oh, boy, we're benefiting from this or this is a headwind here. But generally, we like the spot we're in. And we think it's, the macro environment where it's been reasonably stable and that's -- we find that attractive and we can be really successful in that environment.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you. Just for a follow-up, you have a competitor there that was spun out, say, six months ago. And I was just wondering, has there been any change in the environment with them competitively in terms, either positively or negatively? I mean, have you seen any changes in the way that they bid? Are you taking more business from them? Maybe you could just comment in general.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Shlomo, I would characterize it as, it's pretty well business as usual. They're a very good competitor, always have been, I'm sure they always will be, and we have a great deal of respect for them. And it's a very competitive environment, always has been as far as -- as long as I've been with the company, it has been, and I'm sure it will be in the future and -- but we're focused on putting our employee partners in the best position to be successful in providing our customers the best value proposition. So really none of that has changed.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead, Kartik.\nKartik Mehta: Yeah, thank you. Hey, good morning. Todd, you have been able to execute extremely well this year, beat guidance. And as you look at the business, is that the result of maybe metrics like non-programmers being a little bit better than you thought? Is it sales being better than you thought? Maybe you're just more cautious about the economy than actually happened. If you look at why you have been able to do better, what would you point to?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Kartik, it starts with our culture and our expectations of our employee partners and the pace and the intensity of which they run. But that being said, we\u2019ve -- our value proposition is really resonating in each of the businesses we're in. The first aid business we spoke about, it's very good. Outsourcing is resonating nicely. Maybe it has to do with, it's not as easy to hire people as it has been in the past, so if you want someone to outsource it, it's that much more attractive. Yeah, we like the spot we're in, and it\u2019s -- and we have exceeded our internal expectations, and we're pleased with that. But there's so many inputs to it, because we're trying to focus on providing better products, better services, better technologies to make our people more successful and to make our customers that much happier. So a lot of inputs but we like where we're positioned and we're continuing to invest for the future.\nKartik Mehta: And just one follow-up, you obviously discussed M&A a lot. I'm wondering, and I know some of these acquisitions can take years to come to fruition. But as you look at the market today, are you seeing any change in the pricing environment, maybe what expectations are from sellers, or has it remained about the same?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Kartik, good question. I wouldn't speak to any change there. It's more about -- certain events might cause them, whether it's an owner's age or succession or -- there's many different life events that would cause them to make a move. And it's more about that to your point. It's in certain cases, these are decades in the making. And you can't really pace them, but when they are ready, we're ready. And we're highly acquisitive, very interested in M&A from all shapes and sizes, big, little, medium, everything in between, we think it\u2019s -- we're very interested.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask a question on the focus verticals. Are you able to share sort of the growth between focus verticals versus non-focus ones? And how do you assess whether to add a new vertical into that sort of focus designation? Is there a different go-to-market strategy for focus verticals as well? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, good morning, Toni. Well, I'll say this about our focus verticals. I certainly expect them to grow faster than the business in general. And when you have an organized approach and you're organized around a customer base, you certainly expect that. And we've chosen what we think are really good verticals that are very attractive. So yeah, I can't give you a specific of -- boy, it's adding X amount of basis points to our total growth, but we think we've chosen well. And we're always analyzing what's -- should we have another one or should we not? And what's the best way? And it really gets down to what puts our employee partners in the best position to be successful and what creates the most value for the customer base. So we're looking, we're evaluating, always doing that, but we like where our investment is at this point.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. I wanted to also ask about your marketing budget and whether you've increased that year-over-year. I recently heard some Cintas commercials on Bloomberg Radio for example, just wondering if that's coincidence or if there's been a greater push towards more marketing? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Toni, first off, thank you. I'm glad to hear that. The algorithm is working and it's hitting our target audience. So I wouldn't say there's been a step change there. It's just trying to be -- make sure our investment is well-placed. And we're trying to leverage analytics and technology to make sure that the investment is deriving the very best ROI as possible. So it's just a matter of tweaks versus a step change in investment.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. Thanks a lot.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared for closing remarks.\nJared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter of fiscal \u201824 financial results in July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue was $2.41 billion, compared to $2.19 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and a difference in the number of workdays was 7.7%. Total growth was positively impacted by 170 basis points due to the extra workday. We remind you, as you update your models for next fiscal year that there will be two less workdays compared to this current fiscal year. Each quarter next year will have 65 workdays, which means, the first and the fourth quarters will each have one less workday than this fiscal year. Organic growth by business was 7.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 11.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 13.9% for Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale was down 3.9%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.19 billion, compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 14.9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.4% for the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 47.2% last year, an increase of 220 basis points. Strong volume growth, technology improvements, and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 56.3% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 41.1% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 170 basis points from last year. Energy was a tailwind of 40 basis points. In addition, we continue to leverage our strong revenue growth, our technology investments and extract inefficiencies out of the business through our Six Sigma and engineering teams. Our technology investments have allowed us to improve garment sharing among our plants, which improves material cost. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide route densities to our existing routes, which positively impacts truck purchasing, labor, and energy. Our Six Sigma and engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our plant equipment, labor, and energy. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 470 basis points from last year. Strong revenue growth continues to help expand our margins in this segment. Strong revenue performance in some of our high-margin recurring revenue products like AED Rentals, eyewash stations, and WaterBreak continues to provide a healthy revenue mix. Our technology investment in SmartTruck continues to provide route optimization and improved efficiencies. And our First Aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contributed to improved gross margins. Selling and administrative expenses increased 90 basis points from last year. The increase was driven by investments in selling resources, technology and our management trainee program, as well as costs associated with an agreement in principle to settle the purported class action contract dispute brought by plaintiffs City of Laurel. We determined that settling the claim is in the best interest of Cintas. The total monetary payment agreed to in the proposed settlement, including the 60 basis points recognized in this quarter is $45 million. We expect that the settlement costs will not impact our financials in future periods. As Todd mentioned earlier, we generated strong cash flow. For the year, our free cash flow increased 31.6%. This has allowed us to invest back into the business, which has resulted in capital expenditures of 4.3% for the year. Our investments include technology to grow the top line and expand margins, automation to improve efficiencies in our plants and additional processing capacity where needed. We expect capital expenditures to finish around 4.25% of revenue for the year. Operating income of $520.8 million compared to $446.8 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.6% in the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.4% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the third quarter was $397.6 million compared to $325.8 million last year. This year's third-quarter diluted EPS of $3.84 compared to $3.14 last year, an increase of 22.3%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $99 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.6%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23. Our guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, we expect that the proposed settlement will not impact our financials in future periods and accordingly, there is no impact on our guidance. Guidance includes $17.4 million of acquired revenue for the fourth quarter. This revenue includes the impact of the recently announced acquisitions during the third quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you. Maybe a couple added points. As Todd said, these are great acquisitions, and we've had a handful of them this fiscal year. Each of the two that Todd talked about is less than $20 million in annual revenue. The $17.4 million that we gave you in our prepared remarks includes the impact of those. But keeping in mind, we've made acquisitions all year long, and so that fourth quarter impact would include all of the acquisitions we've made throughout the last 12 months. Just something to keep in mind as you're thinking about our fourth quarter. Yeah. So, Andy, I already forgot your first part of the question. What was your first part? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I apologize. No, as Todd talked about, our market remains very large, the momentum in the business remains good, the adoption remains good, and the guide for the fourth quarter is right where we want to be in terms of sort of the stated profile of growth that we want to have. And so, all of that put together with not really any change in customer behavior would mean, no, continued performance like we've seen, and we continue to like the momentum of the business. As it relates to your second question, the 60 basis points, that was not contemplated in the initial guide from the beginning of the year and that was simply absorbed through -- well, in this third quarter, the 60 basis points simply absorbed. And maybe one added comment Luke, when we think about this business, you may have heard us speak to umbrellas of image, safety, cleanliness and compliance and when we think about this business, safety is a fairly large umbrella and when our first aid and safety people are speaking with customers and thinking about that innovation that Todd talked about, we're thinking quite broadly about how do we keep our customers, how do we help our customers keep their employees safe. And that can mean opportunities into the future. And that's the way we look at it from a broad perspective. Yeah, we've -- each quarter this year has been 22% or higher, which is quite a big improvement from a year ago. And so, as Todd said, these -- and we want to continue to invest in the long-term growth of all of our businesses. And you can really see those investments playing out, particularly in the gross margin line of first aid and safety. But we love the margins. They're up quite a bit over the last few years. And we'll continue to invest as we see appropriate. Yes. Todd talked a little bit about how we are working on all pieces of the business, but certainly one of those is inventory, and he touched on a little bit of garment sharing. So you can think about when we improve garment sharing, for example, we don't need to inject as many new garments into that in-service inventory. So the more sharing means better utilization of our existing in-service inventory, and it means we don't have to add as much into the in-service inventory from new purchases. That's one of the areas. Certainly, though, there are others like improved sourcing as well. Volume growth, as Todd said, remains really strong, and so what we're seeing is some nice offsetting of the volume growth with some of these initiatives. Yeah, the only thing I might add is we're certainly in the very early innings of technology and we believe there's a nice runway there. Todd talked about just the recent migration to the Google Cloud and that creates a foundation for us to do some interesting things moving forward. Sure. So as Todd said, the fire business in particular, the margins have increased quite a bit in the last handful of years, and we've seen a lot of the same initiatives and other initiatives specific to that business really take off like we've seen in our other businesses. The one thing I might point out there, we did see some increase in SG&A and the fire business year-over-year, and we're starting to get into that SAP implementation for the fire business. So we might see a little bit of pressure as we move into fiscal \u201825 on the fire margins, the overall margins because of that investment and that move. But as you've seen with our rental and first aid and safety businesses, once we understand how to use that and get proficient at it, it can create some really nice opportunities. So maybe a little bit of -- we've seen some great improvement, maybe a little bit of next year and the following year pressure on SG&A because of that implementation, but we certainly expect those margins to continue to improve in the longer term. From a uniform direct sale margin perspective, as Todd said, that business is going to go up and down. It's going to be a little bit bumpy from quarter to quarter. And because of that, the margins will be as well. So I don't think there's anything specific to call out other than it isn't quite as consistent of a business as the other three that we have."

            "name": "Todd Schneider",
            "content": "Thank you, Jared. Due to the outstanding dedication and execution of our employees, whom we call partners, we delivered very strong results for our third quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter grew 9.9% to $2.41 billion. The revenue dollars represent record quarterly revenue. We are pleased with the performance of each of our businesses. Our revenue growth remains robust and we have good momentum in the business. New business remains strong. Our sales team continues to operate at a high level. We are seeing broad success across the many verticals, particularly within our focus verticals, as well as our cross-selling efforts and penetration of new products and services within our existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels. Our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the third quarter increased 220 basis points to a record 49.4%, an increase of 14.9%. Operating income was a record 21.6%, an increase of 16.6%. Diluted EPS grew a robust 22.3% to $3.84. Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter grew 32.8% over the prior year. In the third quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses through capital expenditures of $107 million. During the third quarter, we made acquisition purchases of $111 million. On March 15th, we paid shareholders $137.6 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid the previous March. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital and through three quarters, we have deployed over $1.4 billion of capital across our priorities of capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, and buybacks. I would like to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third-quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion to a range of $9.57 billion to $9.6 billion, a total growth rate of 8.6% to 8.9%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14.35 to $14.65, to a range of $14.80 to $15, a growth rate of 13.9% to 15.5%. Mike? Thank you for your question, Ronan. It's -- when you think about the gross margin, it really starts with our culture, how we run our business, the expectations we have, the intensity of which we run it, and the focus. That being said, there's many, many inputs to those numbers. Certainly, our investments that we are making are paying off. The investments in SmartTruck, the investments in our Six Sigma team, the investment in our engineering team, the investment in our supply chain organization are all helping us to improve those results. So I can't give you an exact number with, hey, SmartTruck gave us X basis points, what have you. It's -- there's many inputs, and we're pleased with the investments that we've made, and we're pleased with the leadership and the culture of the organization, where they're focused on driving those results, providing a better experience for our customers and providing a better experience for our employee-partners. Yeah, good question. So when we think about our growth, again, there's many contributing factors. We really like where we are from a growth standpoint, the internal growth, certainly we like the acquisitions that we've made. They're really good businesses. But when we think about the components of it, certainly pricing is a component, but it is not the majority. The majority of our growth is from volume growth. And that's really pleasing to us because we want to be able to grow our business in that manner. Pricing is -- has moderated and it's much closer to historical, and that's exactly what we had planned throughout the year. Where we're really benefiting is from our new business. Our team is performing at a high level. Our service organization is -- the retention levels are very attractive. And then we are cross-selling appropriately. We have a great breadth of products and services that we want to make sure that our customers and our prospects are aware of. And so we're benefiting kind of across all, not kind of, we are benefiting across all of those areas, and they're all big contributing factors, but we like where we are and we like how we're growing the business. Yeah, Josh, good morning. Again, we like where we are from a growth standpoint. The exciting thing is there's -- we service a little over a million customers. There's 16 million businesses in North America, so we're -- we think there's an incredible runway for us. So we're selling to -- about 60% of our new accounts come from no programmers, and that is continuing. So we're seeing great results from talking to prospects and showing them a better way to do it than they are today. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that, that is new spend. They might be spending that money somehow. It's just we're redirecting it to do it better, smarter, faster, in some cases, even less expensive than the way they're doing it. So we think the runway is very attractive because of the number of prospects that are out there and our business -- or, excuse me, our buying proposition resonating with prospects and customers. So, we expect that we like where we are from a growth standpoint. As I mentioned, we like how we're growing and we want to continue in that manner. Yeah. So we're -- we recognize the math of 20% to 30% incremental margins. We need to be the higher end of that in order to continue to improve our margins and we're focused on doing that. We're doing so by extracting out those inefficiencies, getting really good leverage on our revenue growth, so many ways. But running a business is not linear. And so, we know there's going to be some puts and takes and some quarters will be higher and some won't be as high. But generally speaking, we like that range. And I prefer the higher end than the lower end, that's for sure. I'm certainly happy to start, Mike. Regarding -- Heather, good morning. And regarding M&A, so it's an important component for us. You certainly cannot pace M&A. So they kind of come as they do, and it takes two to dance. And -- but I can tell you the two that we announced this past quarter are great businesses first off, really good operators, really attractive businesses. In the case of the one in Kentucky, it provided us with some needed capacity in that region of the country. In addition to the added capacity, we were able to absorb that volume into seven of our facilities. So some really nice synergies allows us to, as we're closer to the customers, to spend more time with the customer and less time driving. So that's important to us. In the case of the acquisition in the M&A in Pennsylvania, we did not acquire any additional capacity. But in that case, we were able to absorb it into 16 of our facilities. So again, attractive synergies, more time with the customer, less time driving. And in those cases, we also then get to talk to our new customers about the broader breadth of products and services that we have. So we think it's -- overall it's very attractive. As I mentioned, it takes two to dance. You can't pace it. But in this case, these were two really attractive businesses, great operators that really made sense for us. Yeah, I'm certainly happy to start. George, good morning. We haven't really seen much of a change in sales cycle as far as our -- the interest in our products and services remains good. We're always continuing -- we're continuing to invest in new products and services. Tweaks, I guess, certainly to them to make it as attractive to the prospects and the customers as possible. But we're not seeing a change. Momentum continues to be good. Outsourcing still resonates and we're seeing, as I mentioned earlier, the no program market is still really, really large. And we've become pretty darn proficient at presenting to those prospects to help them run a better business. And we help them with all the products and services we provide. And as I mentioned, it's not always new money. Usually they're spending something. It's just redirecting it to us to do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper type thing. Yeah. So, George, so it's in our internal growth. So it is helping us -- that focus is helping us to organize around the customer and provide the products and services that they want. And that has been a good strategy for us over the past number of years. So we like all the verticals we're in. We find them very attractive. Whether it's healthcare, hospitality, education, state, local government, business, it's all attractive and we're organized around it and our value proposition is resonating with them. Good morning, Luke. We really like the First Aid business. Part of our culture is continued innovation. So we're always looking at improving our -- improving our processes, improving our products, improving our services, so it's always a component. I cannot give you a number of, hey, it was X basis points of growth due to a product rollout or what have you, but I can tell you this. The value proposition in the First Aid business and all of our businesses, but in First Aid, as you asked about, it's really resonating. And the mix of business that we have there is really good. And we're able to be better sourcers, better providers of products with our investment and our distribution center. So when you have a robust supply chain that allows us to get products to the customers in a really timely fashion, it puts us in a great spot to be successful. And so yeah, cross-sell, we're absolutely, we want all of our customers, whether they're uniform or fire or direct sale customer, we want them all to know about our First Aid business. And we try to make sure that that occurs in many different conduits, but it's, yeah, we're benefiting from that cross-sell. Yeah, Luke, yeah, again, I'll go back to our culture. Our culture is such that we are constantly innovating and pushing ourselves to be the -- to provide the best products and services. And so you'll see more of that to come. We're constantly innovating to put our partners in the best position, our employee partners in the best position to provide the most value for our customers. Good morning, Andrew. As you know, we don't give out those specific numbers, but directionally to your question, yeah, we're seeing growth across them at all. It's -- there's good demand for our uniform business and our facility services business, frankly for all of our business products and services. So, nothing to point out to one particular area there. As far as ad stops, we haven't really seen a change to our customer behavior there. So, it's -- I'll call it kind of business as usual. There's many inputs to that number, but nevertheless, I'd say it's kind of business as usual. Yes, sir. Yeah, Jasper, good morning. As I mentioned, we really like the business and it's performing really well and we're investing appropriately. The amount of prospects out there are massive. And to Mike's point earlier, the value proposition is resonating. We talk about the mantra in that business is what's more important to a business than the health and safety of their employees and their customers. So that is resonating. We're in a great position to invest to provide those products and services. So we're doing just that. And so we're investing in selling resources, we're investing in marketing resources, because we really like where we are and it makes sense to invest. And I think you're seeing it show up in the operating margin and the gross margin. Jasper, good question. Certainly, labor is an important component. We want to make sure that we're providing attractive wages, competitive wages. And we've spoken on previous calls that we were not flat-footed when it came to the wage inflation that I'd say North America has seen over the past few years. So we've been in a good position and we like where we are from that perspective. And here's what's really exciting, is we have, I mentioned earlier, our Six Sigma teams, our engineering teams, they're helping us to automate certain items to bring transformation technology to portions of our business, whether it's SmartTruck or plant efficiencies, that allows us to mitigate that subject as best as possible. And so we're investing and have invested for years in those organizations and it's paying off in -- and what we're seeing with our total labor costs as we manage through and make sure we're still in a really good spot to be a competitive and attract the very best people. Good question, Ashish. I would characterize -- well, first off, we have a great relationship with Google. You're correct, we did migrate to the Google Cloud platform and I would characterize it as we're in the early innings there. And so we certainly hope to maximize our relationship and put our employee partners in a position to provide more value and to be as successful as possible. Because we believe there's tools that will be available to us to provide more value to the customers and to put our people in a better position to provide that value which makes them more successful. So early innings, but we're optimistic about where that can go. Good morning, Stephanie. From our strategic initiatives that we're focused on how can we impact our business in total, certainly our material costs, our energy, our labor. And Mike referred to earlier, our energy spend is down 40 basis points. That's not all just price. That is, those initiatives that we referred to earlier, the material cost is -- our two largest costs are material costs and labor. So we're very focused on driving efficiencies in all those areas, because to Mike's earlier point, we love the volume growth, but we don't want to sacrifice margin because the volume growth is so robust that we've got these strategic initiatives to extract these inefficiencies out of our business. And I wouldn't speak to any one in particular that it's in the earlier innings or the others. We've got a nice runway forward for doing that. A little bit of that is our culture, is that we're constantly trying to innovate and push ourselves to be better. So I think you'll see that continued. As far as acceleration, it's built in. We're constantly doing it. So I think we're focused on those incremental margins and this is an important component of making sure that we can hit those numbers. I'll start on the outlook and, Mike, if you want to speak to the margins. The uniform direct sale business is strategic business for us. We have some really large strategic accounts, whether it's national accounts or in the hospitality, gaming area of our business. And so strategic meaning that those customers spend a lot more money with us not just with garment direct sale but also outside of that. So that's important. That being said, that business certainly can be a little lumpy due to the nature of it with rollouts and purchases. But we like where we're positioned there. We like the value proposition that we're -- where we are there. So we think the outlook's very positive there. As far as the fire business, it's been a great business for us. The results over the last several years, we've seen great revenue growth, we've seen great margin improvement, and it's the only business we're in where you legally have to have those products and services. So we think it's -- the outlook is really positive because of the prospects that are out there and the runway we see for opportunity. So, Mike, if you want to comment on margin. Good morning, Shlomo. Yeah, from a macro environment, as I mentioned, we haven't seen much change in our customer behavior. Certainly there is always some puts and takes. And as you mentioned, our employer is under pressure to figure out ways to automate things because wage inflation, that has occurred and will continue to occur, it's occurred for many, many years. Now there's also some -- the infrastructure bills that are out there, the on-shoring. I can't speak to specifics of, oh, boy, we're benefiting from this or this is a headwind here. But generally, we like the spot we're in. And we think it's, the macro environment where it's been reasonably stable and that's -- we find that attractive and we can be really successful in that environment. Yeah, Shlomo, I would characterize it as, it's pretty well business as usual. They're a very good competitor, always have been, I'm sure they always will be, and we have a great deal of respect for them. And it's a very competitive environment, always has been as far as -- as long as I've been with the company, it has been, and I'm sure it will be in the future and -- but we're focused on putting our employee partners in the best position to be successful in providing our customers the best value proposition. So really none of that has changed. Yeah, Kartik, it starts with our culture and our expectations of our employee partners and the pace and the intensity of which they run. But that being said, we've -- our value proposition is really resonating in each of the businesses we're in. The first aid business we spoke about, it's very good. Outsourcing is resonating nicely. Maybe it has to do with, it's not as easy to hire people as it has been in the past, so if you want someone to outsource it, it's that much more attractive. Yeah, we like the spot we're in, and it's -- and we have exceeded our internal expectations, and we're pleased with that. But there's so many inputs to it, because we're trying to focus on providing better products, better services, better technologies to make our people more successful and to make our customers that much happier. So a lot of inputs but we like where we're positioned and we're continuing to invest for the future. Yeah, Kartik, good question. I wouldn't speak to any change there. It's more about -- certain events might cause them, whether it's an owner's age or succession or -- there's many different life events that would cause them to make a move. And it's more about that to your point. It's in certain cases, these are decades in the making. And you can't really pace them, but when they are ready, we're ready. And we're highly acquisitive, very interested in M&A from all shapes and sizes, big, little, medium, everything in between, we think it's -- we're very interested. Yeah, good morning, Toni. Well, I'll say this about our focus verticals. I certainly expect them to grow faster than the business in general. And when you have an organized approach and you're organized around a customer base, you certainly expect that. And we've chosen what we think are really good verticals that are very attractive. So yeah, I can't give you a specific of -- boy, it's adding X amount of basis points to our total growth, but we think we've chosen well. And we're always analyzing what's -- should we have another one or should we not? And what's the best way? And it really gets down to what puts our employee partners in the best position to be successful and what creates the most value for the customer base. So we're looking, we're evaluating, always doing that, but we like where our investment is at this point. Yeah, Toni, first off, thank you. I'm glad to hear that. The algorithm is working and it's hitting our target audience. So I wouldn't say there's been a step change there. It's just trying to be -- make sure our investment is well-placed. And we're trying to leverage analytics and technology to make sure that the investment is deriving the very best ROI as possible. So it's just a matter of tweaks versus a step change in investment. Thank you."

Second quarter total revenue grew 9.3% to $2.38 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. Our momentum in the business is good and volume remains robust. We can grow in a number of different ways. Contribution to our growth from new business remained strong and comes from companies that either outsource their program today or they are managing it themselves. We continue to have great success cross-selling to existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels, and our value proposition of image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance continues to resonate across businesses of all sizes and in all verticals. We continue to be pleased with the results from our focus on prospects within the verticals of healthcare, hospitality, education, and state and local government. We recently announced the opening of two cleanroom facilities, one in North Carolina and the other in Wisconsin. These facilities will provide additional capacity in these regions in order to expand our efforts in this area of attractive growth from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the second quarter grew 11.6% and operating income grew 12.3%. Diluted EPS grew 15.7% to $3.61. Cash flow remained strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter grew 17.8% over the prior year. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital. In the second quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses. We also acquired several smaller businesses. On December 15th, we paid shareholders $137.5 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid the previous December. During the second quarter, we also purchased $320.3 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. I would like to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Now, before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our second quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.40 billion to $9.52 billion to a range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion, a total growth rate of 7.5% to 8.4%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14.00 to $14.45 to a range of $14.35 to $14.65, a growth rate of 10.5% to 12.8%. Mike?\nMike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 second quarter revenue was $2.38 billion compared to $2.1 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 9%. Organic growth by business was 7.9% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 12.7% for First Aid and Safety Services, 17.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 4.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.02 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 48% for the second quarter of fiscal \u201824 compared to 47% last year, an increase of 100 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.4% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 54.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.6% for Fire Protection Services, and 40.9% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 40 basis points from last year. We continue to leverage our strong revenue growth and extract inefficiencies out of the business in order to expand margins. Our year-over-year improvements are no accident. Our Six Sigma and Engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our equipment, labor, and energy. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide density to our existing routes. While energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a tailwind of 40 basis points from last year, please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies just mentioned. As an example, our rental revenue grew organically at 7.9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure since last year. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 400 basis points from last year. Our revenue growth is strong and value -- our value proposition continues to resonate in this segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. Our mix of revenues continues to be healthy, including growing high margin recurring revenue products like AED rentals, eyewash stations, and WaterBreak. We continue to use technology like SmartTruck to optimize our routes and improve efficiencies. And our first aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contributes to our improved margins. Selling and administrative expenses grew $64.4 million or 11.1% over last year. Strong revenue growth creates leverage, which allows us to invest in the business. We continue to invest in our people, adding selling resources, investing in our management trainee program to develop future leaders, and expanding our talent acquisition efforts. Operating income of $499.7 million compared to $444.9 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 21% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 20.5% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the second quarter was $374.6 million compared to $324.3 million last year. This year's second quarter diluted EPS of $3.61 compared to $3.12 last year, an increase of 15.7%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal \u201824 interest expense is expected to be $100 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal \u201823, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal \u201824 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal \u201823. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal \u201824 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal \u201823 compared to fiscal -- I'm sorry, fiscal \u201824 compared to fiscal \u201823. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. I'll turn it back to Jared.\nJared Mattingley: Thanks, Mike. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up, if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just on the four verticals that you highlighted as areas of strength in particular. I was wondering if you can quantify how big the combined revenues are from those verticals and how does the growth profile there compare to the company average? Any color? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Ashish. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. We don't -- I don't have any specific number for you as far as that exact number, but I can tell you that our verticals are performing quite well. We're having really good success. Our focus around not just selling but organizing around those is really paying off for us. And I've just got a couple of wins I can share with you regarding the verticals. In healthcare, in the acute space, we're having good success and non-acute as well. We\u2019ve got a scrub rental program to a big hospital network in South Carolina that is benefiting from a new consistent image but also identification. The customer told us that they were interested in being able to -- pardon me, identify their people, understanding who was supposed to be in what area and this new scrub program did that. We had a really similar experience with a nursing home in Virginia. Same thing. They were buying their own and they -- but the leadership wanted to be able to identify and have a consistent image with their people. We had a -- on the acute side, again a hospital in Florida that we rolled out a new microfiber program because they were struggling with inventory control and product quality, which led to cleanliness concerns. And our program offered some great products, technology to control the inventory, which allow them to focus more on their patients, instead of having a full run with trying to manage the microfiber. Excuse me. And then I've got a couple of other examples I thought might be helpful for the group. In our government sector, we have -- we just recently rolled out a first aid and AED rental program to a public library system in California, which is -- you wouldn't think of a public library system as being a great prospect for us, but it is. They realized that the value would bring to their employees and being prepared with the AEDs in case it was needed because the publics in their locations. And then lastly, I'll just share with you a little bit on education. A variety of wins there. We had a chemistry department at a nice-sized university in Virginia. They put all their educators and students in a lab tour program. The maintenance department at a University in California put all of their people in Carhartt uniforms, a rental program from us, they love the Carhartt. And then the last item would be there was a dining facility at a university in Arizona where they put all their culinary people in Chef Works, which is a big win for those folks. The branded programs with Carhartt and Chef Works were big wins. So, I don't want to belabor it, but I thought I would just share a few wins because I know verticals are of interest to yourself, Ashish, but also plenty of other folks on the call.\nMike Hansen: Yeah. The only other thing I might add is, as Todd just talked about, we have so many ways to win, and clearly, those verticals are growing faster than the average. So we still are seeing really good momentum in each of those.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great color and thanks for sharing those events. It does provide a lot more clarity on those verticals. And if I can ask a quick follow-up. I was just wondering if there is -- if you could share any update on your technology, the SmartTruck program, and particularly the partnership with Google, Verizon, and SAP, any updates on that front? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Certainly. I think how -- one of the things we have around here is we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop. And -- so we're -- or the way Mike described it, in total for our company, we grew revenues over 9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure in total. So that means we're spending more time with the customer, less time driving, which is better for our customers, better for our partners, and better for Cintas. So we're pleased with that. Our technology and we still have plenty of room to go there. We're focused on bringing those efficiencies, extracting out the inefficiencies in our business. We sent out a note -- a press release regarding our migration this quarter to the Google Cloud, that has been very successful for us. There's a number of benefits that we get from moving from a server farm to the Google Cloud. The first one is it's more secure, so very important to us. Second item is, over time, we believe we will -- that'll be more cost-effective for us. And the third is it gives us access to Google's AI platform. So certainly in the very early innings, we just migrated, but we think that that will be able to help us longer term in making it more attractive, making it easier to do business with Cintas, making sure that we are positioning our people to be successful, to point them in the right direction and leverage that type of -- those types of tools.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, Manav.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Todd, just to follow up on all the wins and contracts you talked about, maybe, I guess the question is more around the competitive environment versus is this just first time outsourcers? Any trends, any changes you're seeing from that front, the new business percentage you've called out before, but whether that's more market share or just first time outsourcing?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Manav. Great question. As Mike said, we win in many ways. We have been selling no programmers since the inception of my career, I can tell you that, and we continue to. And I'll just remind you, there is -- we service a little over a million businesses, but there's 16 million businesses in the US and Canada, so there's plenty of opportunity there. And we like both. We certainly win some from the competitors. We like growing the pie. And then the examples I was giving, it's a mix. But in large part, it is -- they were either doing it in house, meaning they were processing microfibers in house, or they were telling their employees to go buy product. So there's different variations of no programmers, meaning some are just -- were buying products and providing to their people and telling them to wear them. Some of them, they were just telling them to show up to work and look good. But nevertheless, we bring so much better consistent program identification, cleanliness, all these and compliance are big drivers for our customers.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then just on the capital allocation front, I mean, the buyback number one of the bigger quarters for a while now. I mean, is that any indication of the M&A market slowing down or just how we should think about that balance there?\nMike Hansen: Manav, we -- no change in what we're seeing in M&A. Still we're working the pipeline as best we can. We've made some nice acquisitions this year. From a buyback perspective, you've heard us speak to it being an opportunistic execution. And that's what you saw this quarter. As we think back about our first quarter results, and we thought they were pretty good, the stock reacted a little bit negatively, and we saw that as a nice opportunity and we took advantage of it. So that is a -- it was a good example during the quarter of an opportunistic execution of that buyback program. And the beauty, Manav, as we speak about our capital allocation, we don't always have to choose right in the quarter or maybe let's call it for the year. We've invested in the business as we've talked about. Our CapEx is up, which is important to us as a part of that investment. M&A is up from last year. Dividends are up 17% from last year, and we've been able to execute on the buyback program. So when you hear us talk about the sort of the four levers of capital allocation, we've done them all, I think, nicely this year. And again, the beauty of our cash flow and our balance sheet is we don't really have to choose.\nTodd Schneider: Mike, I would just add that we think we're being really good fiduciaries of our shareholders' investments. Mike mentioned all the levers. And the net-net of that is we still have great dry powder, which allows us to take on M&A of all shapes and sizes and we're interested in that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Joshua.\nJoshua Chan: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, Todd, you mentioned the opening of the cleanrooms. I was just wondering if you can kind of frame for us what you see as the attractive parts of this business. How is it attractive? And what kind of opportunity does it mean for Cintas going forward in the cleanrooms?\nTodd Schneider: Thanks for the question, Josh. Yeah, the cleanroom business is, it's an attractive sector for us. I mentioned pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and there's -- it seems like there's more and more every year that need that level of cleaning, that level of cleanliness. So, that is -- we think that bodes well for that business in the future. And there has been -- you've seen some momentum onshoring in that area. And we want to make sure that we have the appropriate capacity to serve our current customers and that we're prepared for the future as well. So, we like the trends in that business, and we like the business.\nJoshua Chan: Great. Thank you for the color there, Todd. And, in fact, if I can follow up with the margin question, I guess, if in the future, the energy favorability were to lessen, could you talk to the opportunities that you still have to drive margin expansion and the targeted incremental margins going forward without as much energy tailwind?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. Great question. Yeah. So, we recognize that energy prices go up, they go down. But one thing that's going to be consistent is, we're going to be focused on extracting out inefficiencies in our route structure and in our production facilities. So, that will be really important to us. And we think there is certainly ample opportunity there still to go. We've talked about the SmartTruck technology, that's been impactful to us in many ways. But what's also impactful is, as Mike mentioned, our Six Sigma team of professionals, our Engineering professionals, and then layering in with that technology allows us to have a centralized visibility into our operations at a level that we've never had before in the history of the company this technology allows us. So -- and it allows us to maximize our labor, our equipment, ultimately our energy spend. So -- and we're focused on extracting out those inefficiencies, so that we can manage it moving forward. We love when energy goes -- costs go down, but we recognize those markets will move, but we're going to be focused on extracting out those inefficiencies.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my question. And first question with regards to the programmers and non-programmers, as we're further and further out from the COVID period, are you still seeing the shift in demand in terms of more non-programmers looking to outsource, or do you think it's starting to normalize back to pre-COVID trends?\nTodd Schneider: Well, Heather, it's a great question. I'll start. Mike, feel free to chime in. We're -- there's various reasons why a prospect would turn into a customer. Going from a no programmer to a customer. One of them is, hey, where we'd like to outsource it, because we're not very good at it or we're not -- we don't have -- we're struggling to staff and we're struggling to find people to manage this. So, that still continues. But there's other reasons. It might be, we don't like the image that we're portraying. We don't like the lack of identification. We don't like the lack of compliance. You can provide them, and we know that they're hygienically clean. So, there's many different motives. One of it might be, hey, we can't staff, and we need help. And we still see that, frankly. And it allows our customers to focus on what's most important to them, taking care of their customers, their patients, their guests, whatever it is, instead of having to manage through these various programs.\nMike Hansen: Heather, the no programmers is still -- we get -- more than 60% of our new business comes from no programmers. Your reference to the pandemic might be, we did certainly, in the early days of the pandemic, see an increase in personal protective equipment and things like hand sanitizer. Those have normalized back to what we would call normal and ongoing levels, so that might be the only change that we had, and back to normal.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. And then, on the margin front, we're just kind of curious, when you think about -- you talked earlier about opportunities for efficiencies and further route productivities, when you think about the source of those savings, how much are just organic Six Sigma efforts, how much is coming from your SAP, and are there still G&K synergy or opportunities that you're kind of benefiting from? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Heather, it's a good question. We don't really discern the difference between our Six Sigma team, our Engineering team and our Technologies. They all have to work, be orchestrated appropriately to get the efficiencies, so -- and that's exactly what we're doing. So, everybody has to be involved. And that's what produces the great results. As for G&K, yeah, we're -- we now -- we\u2019re I think about six and a half years since we acquired, if my math is correct. So, yeah, I wouldn't say that there's anything left on the bone there.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Andy Wittmann from RW Baird. Please go ahead, Andy.\nAndy Wittmann: Yeah, great. Thanks. Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I guess, I just wanted to ask on the outlook a little bit here, Mike. The second half total revenue guidance is in the 7% range at the midpoint against an organic 9% quarter here. So, a degree of deceleration. I guess that was implicit in your previous guidance as well. But just thought maybe give you a chance to elaborate a little bit more on that, talk about what you're seeing in the macro, if that's just you guys being kind of your normal prudent approach, or if there's something that we should be considering?\nMike Hansen: Andy, I'd lead with it's our normal prudent approach. And when you think about where we are, we've talked a little bit already about growth is still good, momentum is good, and so we like where the business is going. The range for the back half of the year does -- certainly does imply a little bit over 7% at the midpoint, a little over 8% at the high point. We like that range. The cadence is good for us, as you know. But, look, as we look into calendar \u201824, there certainly is a little bit of uncertainty as to what the new economy may bring, what the Fed movements may bring, and so we think it is wise to be prudent as we look out.\nAndy Wittmann: Great. That's my only question for today. Have a Merry Christmas, guys.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Andy.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Earlier you mentioned that business momentum was good. Volumes were robust in the quarter. Can you provide more color on overall customer budget trends and customer sentiment, and any changes that you might be seeing in the sales cycle?\nTodd Schneider: George, we -- good morning, George. We -- forward-looking, as Mike said, there's always -- we're not trying to prognosticate exactly how our customers will react to the turning of the calendar year, but we're not seeing any change in sales cycles, and we haven't seen a change in our customer base and they're -- how they're reacting to what's going on in the marketplace. So, it's kind of business has been consistent, and it's more what Mike referred to the turn of the calendar year. And we'll see how businesses react coming out of the holidays.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And also you mentioned cross selling was good in the quarter. Can you elaborate more on cross selling trends that you're seeing, in which areas you're seeing most amount of bundling or upsell, cross sell from?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, George. Cross sell is -- it's an important component of our growth, and the nature of it is we're having good success across all of our areas of our business. We're blessed to be in a position where our customers, fortunately, they really like us. They like our relationships. We have people in their businesses on a really frequent basis, mostly on a weekly basis. So they -- and we have -- so that means we have eyes, ears, and minds in their business and we can help. And it doesn't matter to us what a customer might lead with, whatever they're interested in, but then we will quickly pivot and we can help them in many ways. So -- but just the nature of the size of the rental division is such that because there is -- are so many customers there, there's plenty of opportunity for our First Aid and Fire business to cross onto that just because of the numbers there. But nevertheless, it's working quite well across all of our organization. We share leads, we share thoughts, and we make sure that the customer is well taken care of.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.\nTim Mulrooney: Yeah, good morning. I just wanted to ask one question. Pricing now normalized back to the 2% range. That means your organic growth was comprised of approximately seven points of volume. I was just hoping you could dig into that a little bit more as it was a little stronger than I think most of us were expecting. Did you see an uptick in retention? Did you have a strong quarter with that cross sell? Or maybe new account growth and any details would be helpful.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, good morning Tim. So our new business is robust. As I mentioned, retention levels are very good and our cross-sell is very good. And the pricing is still, it's lower than last year. It is higher than historical, but it's certainly getting much closer to historical. So -- but when you -- so when you think about that, it is -- our various inputs to growth are all performing well, and we expect that to continue.\nMike Hansen: And as we talk, we win in a lot of ways. And the momentum in the rental business is still really good. But we also saw in the quarter some really nice acceleration in First Aid and Safety from 11% in the first quarter to 12.7% organically in the second quarter. And we saw some nice improvement in Fire where we went from a little over 14% in the first quarter to 17.8% in the second quarter. So we just see some really good momentum in all of our businesses. And particularly those two had some really nice performance in the second quarter.\nTim Mulrooney: Yeah, I did notice that re-acceleration across both those businesses. That's helpful color. Thanks, guys. Happy holidays.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Tim. You as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. Could you just mention if your ad stops directionally and the uniform rental business was up, down, or flat recently?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Andrew. Our ad stop metrics are -- have been pretty consistent. We haven't seen much of a change in our customer base. And so I'd say that's how I would describe it. We see still positive trends in our ad stop metrics, but that's pretty consistent as it has been for the last six to twelve months.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay, thank you very much.\nTodd Schneider: Yes sir, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper.\nJasper Bibb: Hey, good morning guys. You mentioned year-on-year tailwind from energy. But was just hoping to get some additional color on other cost inputs, I guess specifically, labor and materials.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, I'll start, Jasper. Good morning. Our -- we're seeing -- just like you're seeing with inflation in total, we're seeing that come down. It's never coming down as fast as we like, but we are seeing it. Cotton is stabilized. We're seeing freight come down and that's important to us. And the labor market is easier. It's still not easy, but it is easier. So I think that probably the right way to think about it would be as the labor market eases, and that will lessen pressure on wage growth as well.\nJasper Bibb: Thanks. And then I wanted to follow up on first aid. Operating margins there were really strong in the first half. Should we think about these like low 20% levels as sustainable going forward? And would you say there's anything that's changed there that's unlocked another leg of operating margin expansion here today?\nMike Hansen: Sure. Jasper, we have seen some nice performance in that business and I spoke to a few of them where from a margin perspective, first of all, the value that we sell with, nothing is more important than the health and safety of your employees is really still resonating well. And so our growth has been really good in that business. We talked a little bit in the opening comments about sort of the recurring revenue streams of AED rentals, our eyewash stations and our WaterBreak. And these have been great businesses for us. The growth has been really good and the margins are great for us. Many times these are add-on products to existing customers. But in all three of them, we install, and then we have a recurring service program that goes on after that. And again, it leads to really nice stickiness and also nice margins. The other thing that I'll point out is we opened a first aid and safety distribution center a couple years ago and that allows us to source more. It allows us to centralize some of our sourcing, and those kind of things lead to a better product cost, and that again drives down the material cost in our first aid and safety business. So the combination of really good sales mix, really good growth in the business, good sourcing, the one I didn't mention was SmartTruck technology that is also having a benefit there. All of those things are contributing. And so this is not a case of six months of sort of unusual items. This is a little bit of a lot of hard work and execution by our first aid and safety partners to really get this margin going.\nJasper Bibb: Very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead, Faiza.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes, hi, thank you, Todd. So I wanted to follow up on both the first aid business and the fire business. You touched on the first aid a little bit, but curious on what's driving the acceleration, if you could expand on that, both on first aid and fire. And then as we think about your outlook, do you expect this level of growth to sustain looking ahead? And, I know in fire, you talked about an SAP implementation that was happening in this fiscal year. So maybe is that helping the top line? Has that happened? How should we think about margins going forward in that business?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Faiza. Thanks for the question. We really like the fire business. It's the only business we're in where you legally have to have it. So there is, I'll call it double negative, no program market. Everyone is a programmer. But we are able to cross-sell very well into that market. We're using various technologies that Mike referenced to make sure that we're positioning our partners to be more successful, meaning we use SmartTruck technology in all of our businesses, and that helps us. But we're getting leverage from our growth. And the growth is attractive. And we think it's \u2013 there\u2019s certainly -- running a business isn't linear. So there will be ebbs and flows, but we like the long-term outlook for the fire business. That being said, as you mentioned, we are going through an SAP implementation. We certainly -- we haven't even implemented at this point, so we haven't seen any benefits just yet, but we're optimistic about how that can help our business over the coming years.\nMike Hansen: Maybe I'll add two things to the fire, and a little bit of first aid too. The market opportunity in those businesses is really large and our expectation as we've talked about is that those businesses will continue into the future near that double digit type of a place. Again, the market opportunity is really large. One last comment on the SAP, we've not started it. And so as we get into that, which is likely going to be more about next fiscal year, we may see a little bit of pressure in the fire segment because as you can imagine, when you turn -- when you start to go into an SAP conversion, you don't get benefits overnight. It takes a little bit of time. So we'll have some additional costs in \u201825 and certainly then setting up really nice benefits into the future for that business.\nFaiza Alwy: Great, thank you. And then if I could just follow up on the macro environment, you made some comments in response to a previous question around just you\u2019re being prudent and there is some uncertainty. Just given sort of how well you are doing [with no programmers] (ph) and the momentum you are seeing in sort of these other businesses, I'm curious if you can give us a framework in terms of how we should think about the impact of macro on your business.\nTodd Schneider: Well, I'll start, Faiza, with, our history has been we grow certainly in multiples of GDP and employment growth and you hit it. We are able to sell into no programmers. Even when they're not, let's say, adding people, we can take pressure off of them by managing programs for them. So our new business effort is always really good. But certainly, if we see turns in the economy, we've got to adjust potentially. If we see our customers start to reduce their number of people, we've got to adjust. And so it is prudent for us to sort of think about that as we look into our guidance and into the future of the business.\nFaiza Alwy: Understood, thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Seth.\nSeth Weber: Hey, good morning and happy holidays, guys. I wanted to just go back to the clean room discussion for a minute. If there's any way to frame how we should be thinking about that, new facility openings, and are those facilities higher CapEx relative to a traditional facility? Is there any way to combine facilities or I'm just trying to get a better understanding of this opportunity and what the investment might be for Cintas going forward? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Seth, thank you for the question. As you know, that's a segment of the uniform market. As I mentioned earlier, it does seem more companies over the last decade or so have higher cleaning quality requirements, so we think there's a tailwind there. As far as the CapEx required for a facility like that, you can think of it as very similar to a uniform facility. The only difference I think that you may want to think about is, it serves usually a larger geographic area than we would with a traditional facility. And the reason being is we only have so many of them and they have to cover the customer base. So as a result of that, we do cover a larger geographic area for -- out of each of those facilities.\nSeth Weber: Okay, that's helpful. Is there any way for us to think about how many of these facilities you might be opening over the next couple of years relative -- I mean I saw the press release for the Wisconsin facility, but is this order of magnitude ones and twos or could this be much bigger going forward?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Seth, I wouldn't -- you're not going to see ones and twos coming out every quarter or every year based upon the size of the market. So it certainly won't be anywhere near that pace. But it will be paced based upon the demand from the marketplace. If there's more and more customers that are interested in it, then we'll be prepared to meet that demand.\nSeth Weber: Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And then maybe just a quick follow up on the direct, it's nice to see the direct sales business turn positive again in the quarter. Is there any color on whether that's coming more from the service side of your customer base, more of the manufacturing side, and any just detail there or is it just kind of across the board?\nTodd Schneider: Good question, Seth. The design collective business, the direct sale portion of it, we've spoken in the past, it's certainly lumpier. And so as far as where that growth is coming from, it's really more national accounts, where we would get it, hospitality, lodging. And when they have rollouts or new allotment programs, you tend to get spikes. And then -- so we love the spikes and then the, what comes after the spike isn't as good, but I wouldn't think about it as a big growth engine for us.\nMike Hansen: Yeah, we typically would say in the low to mid-single-digit growth. So this quarter is sort of in line with that expectation.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch a bit on maybe the cross-sell opportunity over time. I think you've provided -- you continue to execute very well on your investments, particularly on the technology front and called out this enhanced visibility that you have. So maybe you can talk about, given some of these investments, what this might mean for cross-selling, meaning the opportunity to add those additional products and kind of continue to further penetrate each existing customer. So kind of how are you balancing the incremental products that you can offer over time? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Stephanie. Well, you can think about it -- we call it cross-sell. There's -- cross-sell is really division to division. There's also upsell which would be, we have products that our customers don't use all of our products, even within the rental division, or the first aid division, and what have you. So, those are all components of growth for us, and we see a significant, massive, frankly, runway in all those areas. So we're trying to position our employee partners to make sure that they're in the right spot and have the right information to help the customer. And then we're also continually, it's part of our corporate culture, is to invest in new products and new services. We're always working on that. And we get those ideas from those customers and then we test them and then we launch them and we're always working on that. It's always been a component of our growth and always will be.\nStephanie Moore: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Happy holidays. I -- my first one, I'm going to delve into the SG&A running low double digits growth, something you did last year as well. And you cited investment in selling resources, management training program, tech, and also some talent acquisition efforts. Just curious, and you guys have said on this call, labor is getting better but still a little tough. Could you elaborate on the labor aspect and kind of what you guys are doing pushing the selling? And then also curious about the tech aspect. Maybe you've already covered it in the call if that's what you meant, but just wondering if there's anything extra there? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. Good morning, Scott. We\u2019re -- the items that you mentioned, they're all really important to us. We are -- there's not one that I would call out, but I would think about it this way. We think the future's really bright and we want to invest for the future. We know we need the talent acquisition team to be attracting the very best talent. The management trainee programs are leaders of the future, and we think they are a critical pipeline, and we're going to need those leaders. And then the selling resources are, we see the -- it looks, we think the future's bright with our, how many customers we have, what the size of the market is. I mentioned 1 million customers, about 16 million businesses. So that's all great. And then you kind of wrap it all with technology, because technology will, we want to make it easier to do business with us, and we want to leverage technology to make our partners more successful. Point them in the right direction, give them the right tools in their toolbox to spend their time in the right spots, but also to make it easier for the customer to buy, easier to do business with in totality.\nScott Schneeberger: Great, thanks, appreciate that. And then, not a lot of acquisition activity in the quarter, but there was some, and there was a good amount in the first quarter. I remember you saying it was across all businesses, but we didn't hit it up too much last quarter. Could you talk about what it is that you're acquiring and clearly across segments, but what the strategies have been there? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Sure, not a lot of change in the strategy, Scott, and that is we love rental tuck-in opportunities and we've made a number of those this year. And as you can imagine, when we do that in a marketplace, we add immediate capacity utilization improvement, route density, and so those things really help us in the rental business. So we've made some of those. We certainly have made some first aid acquisitions, and we've made fire acquisitions. Again, the dynamic is similar in all three of these. These are really nice tuck-in opportunities that just strengthen our business in the local markets in which we acquire them, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities as best we can.\nTodd Schneider: One thing I might add is, to Mike's point, we get synergies. It helps us with density, helps us with capacity utilization, allows us to spend more time with the customers. So all that's valuable, but in each of the businesses, depending upon the business we acquire. But normally when we make an acquisition in rental, first aid, or fire, we're able to provide an offering to that customer base that's broader than what they had in the past. So the rental waiver broader offering than most companies out there, certainly in the first aid we do as well. And depending upon the [fire] (ph) acquisition, that's very consistent. Separate from, then we can cross sell. So it adds nice value.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead, Shlomo. Shlomo, is you line muted?\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Sorry, my line was muted. This is a question basically for Mike, just a little bit going through some of the technical items in the quarter. Receivables days were up two days sequentially. I was wondering if there was a lot of business that came in at the end of the quarter. Are you seeing any changing patterns in what clients are paying or any other factors in that because the last time we saw 48 days was during COVID.\nMike Hansen: Shlomo, when our quarters end on a holiday and it seems like too many of them do, it does create a little bit of disruption in terms of the ability to collect the mail, the application. We have seen maybe just a touch of slowing in the AR, but we've not seen any, I'll say deterioration from the standpoint of additional write-offs. But we did see a little bit of slowing, and the Thanksgiving holiday can usually contribute to that.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Then in the OPM, the operating margin, the other unit was up very nicely sequentially, even though there's one less day sequentially in the quarter. Could you just give us some of the mechanics or tell us just what's going on on the ground over there? It's increasing the margin very nicely and is that something that we should expect to continue at kind of that 16% level?\nMike Hansen: Well we -- certainly the revenue growth is powerful in all of our businesses and when we see some really nice revenue growth, that's important. The other thing that I would say is you know the uniform direct sale business went from a negative 2.7% in terms of revenue growth to 4.7%. And that is important for operating margins too. So we did see some nice improvement there in the direct sale. Nothing I would say that is noteworthy other than, again, some nice acceleration in the revenue.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Leo Carrington from Citigroup. Please go ahead, Leo.\nLeo Carrington: Thank you, and good morning. If I could ask a follow up on that point around the one-off or the cost that you called out in Q2 around current acquisition, training, technology. Were you calling them out to any of these one-off increases in nature or more to highlight where the spend is? And then in terms of the underlying margins and drop through in Q2 on your organic growth, do you see that as sustainable when you factor in the additional investment this quarter?\nMike Hansen: Well, Leo, I\u2019ll start with, we call them out because we think it's important to make sure that our investors understand that we are looking at the long term and we want to continue to invest in the business. And those investments are really important and they set up, let's say, more penetration opportunities, more cross-sell opportunities, but also productivity improvements, capacity utilization opportunities. In these cases, we wanted to call them out to show that, look, we're focused on the long-term and we're going to continue in the business. As Todd said a couple times, the future is bright for us and we want to make sure that we take advantage of that bright future by investing in the business and the call outs were really more about that. The future is bright. In the quarter, we had incremental margins of 27%. Look, our expectation is that we're going to be in the 20% to 30% range going forward. We recognize that when we're sitting at 21%, they need to be in the higher level of that range. And we think that\u2019s -- that we can continue to do that. And when we talk about things like SAP and technology and other investments, and by the way, we're able to get 27% even when we're investing in the business. But we give those to say we're setting up those future margin and revenue opportunities. It's important for us to, I think, communicate that.\nLeo Carrington: Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. You mentioned the success that you've had with the branded products earlier, particularly with Carhartt and Chef Works. Could you just remind us if these are exclusive relationships and how long the relationships are for and then are there any other areas that could benefit from branded products or equipment that you could offer as well?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Toni, thank you for the question. So we've had a long standing relationship with Carhartt and Chef Works, and we are the exclusive licensees for those folks, for those companies on the rental programs. And so we work with them to design products that the end users want, want to wear, and -- but also that goes very well through our processing systems. So that's all very important to us. As far as, we don't get into contractual arrangements with them, but I can tell you this. We love products that our end users are, that get excited about wearing them. And Carhartt and Chef Works are two great examples of that, in great companies, great brands, great products. And as far as are there other opportunities, we're constantly looking for that. And we spend a lot of time with our customers and with our working partners to talk about that and to see where those opportunities do come from. But those are two great relationships, long-standing relationships that are really important to us.\nToni Kaplan: Yep, terrific. And maybe if you could just give us your latest thoughts on potential international expansion, that'd be great. Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: I'd say, similar to products, we're always looking at those types of opportunities. We certainly know, stay in contact with the people that are running those businesses. But the great news is we don't have to do that to -- in order to be really, really successful in the future. We look at it and say there's, again, we're servicing about 1 million businesses. There's 16 million businesses in US and Canada. Here's what's really exciting is by the time we get to 2 million customers, there will be more than 16 million businesses in the US and Canada. So that's kind of a bummer if you're running a race but it's really exciting if you're running a business because once we get to the 2 mile mark, the race is going to be extended. So that's separate from -- we're going to have more products and services over the coming year. So all that being said is, we continue to watch it, we evaluate it, we look for the right opportunity, and if that opportunity presents itself, then we will seize it, but it's certainly not -- it's not required in order for us to be successful in the future.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared Mattingley to close out the call.\nJared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal \u201824 financial results in March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Hansen",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 second quarter revenue was $2.38 billion compared to $2.1 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 9%. Organic growth by business was 7.9% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 12.7% for First Aid and Safety Services, 17.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 4.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.02 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 48% for the second quarter of fiscal \u201824 compared to 47% last year, an increase of 100 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.4% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 54.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.6% for Fire Protection Services, and 40.9% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 40 basis points from last year. We continue to leverage our strong revenue growth and extract inefficiencies out of the business in order to expand margins. Our year-over-year improvements are no accident. Our Six Sigma and Engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our equipment, labor, and energy. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide density to our existing routes. While energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a tailwind of 40 basis points from last year, please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies just mentioned. As an example, our rental revenue grew organically at 7.9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure since last year. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 400 basis points from last year. Our revenue growth is strong and value -- our value proposition continues to resonate in this segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. Our mix of revenues continues to be healthy, including growing high margin recurring revenue products like AED rentals, eyewash stations, and WaterBreak. We continue to use technology like SmartTruck to optimize our routes and improve efficiencies. And our first aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contributes to our improved margins. Selling and administrative expenses grew $64.4 million or 11.1% over last year. Strong revenue growth creates leverage, which allows us to invest in the business. We continue to invest in our people, adding selling resources, investing in our management trainee program to develop future leaders, and expanding our talent acquisition efforts. Operating income of $499.7 million compared to $444.9 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 21% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 20.5% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the second quarter was $374.6 million compared to $324.3 million last year. This year's second quarter diluted EPS of $3.61 compared to $3.12 last year, an increase of 15.7%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal \u201824 interest expense is expected to be $100 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal \u201823, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal \u201824 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal \u201823. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal \u201824 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal \u201823 compared to fiscal -- I'm sorry, fiscal \u201824 compared to fiscal \u201823. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. I'll turn it back to Jared. Yeah. The only other thing I might add is, as Todd just talked about, we have so many ways to win, and clearly, those verticals are growing faster than the average. So we still are seeing really good momentum in each of those. Manav, we -- no change in what we're seeing in M&A. Still we're working the pipeline as best we can. We've made some nice acquisitions this year. From a buyback perspective, you've heard us speak to it being an opportunistic execution. And that's what you saw this quarter. As we think back about our first quarter results, and we thought they were pretty good, the stock reacted a little bit negatively, and we saw that as a nice opportunity and we took advantage of it. So that is a -- it was a good example during the quarter of an opportunistic execution of that buyback program. And the beauty, Manav, as we speak about our capital allocation, we don't always have to choose right in the quarter or maybe let's call it for the year. We've invested in the business as we've talked about. Our CapEx is up, which is important to us as a part of that investment. M&A is up from last year. Dividends are up 17% from last year, and we've been able to execute on the buyback program. So when you hear us talk about the sort of the four levers of capital allocation, we've done them all, I think, nicely this year. And again, the beauty of our cash flow and our balance sheet is we don't really have to choose. Heather, the no programmers is still -- we get -- more than 60% of our new business comes from no programmers. Your reference to the pandemic might be, we did certainly, in the early days of the pandemic, see an increase in personal protective equipment and things like hand sanitizer. Those have normalized back to what we would call normal and ongoing levels, so that might be the only change that we had, and back to normal. Andy, I'd lead with it's our normal prudent approach. And when you think about where we are, we've talked a little bit already about growth is still good, momentum is good, and so we like where the business is going. The range for the back half of the year does -- certainly does imply a little bit over 7% at the midpoint, a little over 8% at the high point. We like that range. The cadence is good for us, as you know. But, look, as we look into calendar \u201824, there certainly is a little bit of uncertainty as to what the new economy may bring, what the Fed movements may bring, and so we think it is wise to be prudent as we look out. And as we talk, we win in a lot of ways. And the momentum in the rental business is still really good. But we also saw in the quarter some really nice acceleration in First Aid and Safety from 11% in the first quarter to 12.7% organically in the second quarter. And we saw some nice improvement in Fire where we went from a little over 14% in the first quarter to 17.8% in the second quarter. So we just see some really good momentum in all of our businesses. And particularly those two had some really nice performance in the second quarter. Sure. Jasper, we have seen some nice performance in that business and I spoke to a few of them where from a margin perspective, first of all, the value that we sell with, nothing is more important than the health and safety of your employees is really still resonating well. And so our growth has been really good in that business. We talked a little bit in the opening comments about sort of the recurring revenue streams of AED rentals, our eyewash stations and our WaterBreak. And these have been great businesses for us. The growth has been really good and the margins are great for us. Many times these are add-on products to existing customers. But in all three of them, we install, and then we have a recurring service program that goes on after that. And again, it leads to really nice stickiness and also nice margins. The other thing that I'll point out is we opened a first aid and safety distribution center a couple years ago and that allows us to source more. It allows us to centralize some of our sourcing, and those kind of things lead to a better product cost, and that again drives down the material cost in our first aid and safety business. So the combination of really good sales mix, really good growth in the business, good sourcing, the one I didn't mention was SmartTruck technology that is also having a benefit there. All of those things are contributing. And so this is not a case of six months of sort of unusual items. This is a little bit of a lot of hard work and execution by our first aid and safety partners to really get this margin going. Maybe I'll add two things to the fire, and a little bit of first aid too. The market opportunity in those businesses is really large and our expectation as we've talked about is that those businesses will continue into the future near that double digit type of a place. Again, the market opportunity is really large. One last comment on the SAP, we've not started it. And so as we get into that, which is likely going to be more about next fiscal year, we may see a little bit of pressure in the fire segment because as you can imagine, when you turn -- when you start to go into an SAP conversion, you don't get benefits overnight. It takes a little bit of time. So we'll have some additional costs in \u201825 and certainly then setting up really nice benefits into the future for that business. Yeah, we typically would say in the low to mid-single-digit growth. So this quarter is sort of in line with that expectation. Sure, not a lot of change in the strategy, Scott, and that is we love rental tuck-in opportunities and we've made a number of those this year. And as you can imagine, when we do that in a marketplace, we add immediate capacity utilization improvement, route density, and so those things really help us in the rental business. So we've made some of those. We certainly have made some first aid acquisitions, and we've made fire acquisitions. Again, the dynamic is similar in all three of these. These are really nice tuck-in opportunities that just strengthen our business in the local markets in which we acquire them, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities as best we can. Shlomo, when our quarters end on a holiday and it seems like too many of them do, it does create a little bit of disruption in terms of the ability to collect the mail, the application. We have seen maybe just a touch of slowing in the AR, but we've not seen any, I'll say deterioration from the standpoint of additional write-offs. But we did see a little bit of slowing, and the Thanksgiving holiday can usually contribute to that. Well we -- certainly the revenue growth is powerful in all of our businesses and when we see some really nice revenue growth, that's important. The other thing that I would say is you know the uniform direct sale business went from a negative 2.7% in terms of revenue growth to 4.7%. And that is important for operating margins too. So we did see some nice improvement there in the direct sale. Nothing I would say that is noteworthy other than, again, some nice acceleration in the revenue. Well, Leo, I'll start with, we call them out because we think it's important to make sure that our investors understand that we are looking at the long term and we want to continue to invest in the business. And those investments are really important and they set up, let's say, more penetration opportunities, more cross-sell opportunities, but also productivity improvements, capacity utilization opportunities. In these cases, we wanted to call them out to show that, look, we're focused on the long-term and we're going to continue in the business.

            "content": "Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our second quarter results and are excited about the future. Second quarter total revenue grew 9.3% to $2.38 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. Our momentum in the business is good and volume remains robust. We can grow in a number of different ways. Contribution to our growth from new business remained strong and comes from companies that either outsource their program today or they are managing it themselves. We continue to have great success cross-selling to existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels, and our value proposition of image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance continues to resonate across businesses of all sizes and in all verticals. We continue to be pleased with the results from our focus on prospects within the verticals of healthcare, hospitality, education, and state and local government. We recently announced the opening of two cleanroom facilities, one in North Carolina and the other in Wisconsin. These facilities will provide additional capacity in these regions in order to expand our efforts in this area of attractive growth from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the second quarter grew 11.6% and operating income grew 12.3%. Diluted EPS grew 15.7% to $3.61. Cash flow remained strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter grew 17.8% over the prior year. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital. In the second quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses. We also acquired several smaller businesses. On December 15th, we paid shareholders $137.5 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid the previous December. During the second quarter, we also purchased $320.3 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. I would like to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Now, before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our second quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.40 billion to $9.52 billion to a range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion, a total growth rate of 7.5% to 8.4%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14.00 to $14.45 to a range of $14.35 to $14.65, a growth rate of 10.5% to 12.8%. Mike? Good morning, Ashish. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. We don't -- I don't have any specific number for you as far as that exact number, but I can tell you that our verticals are performing quite well. We're having really good success. Our focus around not just selling but organizing around those is really paying off for us. And I've just got a couple of wins I can share with you regarding the verticals. In healthcare, in the acute space, we're having good success and non-acute as well. We've got a scrub rental program to a big hospital network in South Carolina that is benefiting from a new consistent image but also identification. The customer told us that they were interested in being able to -- pardon me, identify their people, understanding who was supposed to be in what area and this new scrub program did that. We had a really similar experience with a nursing home in Virginia. Same thing. They were buying their own and they -- but the leadership wanted to be able to identify and have a consistent image with their people. We had a -- on the acute side, again a hospital in Florida that we rolled out a new microfiber program because they were struggling with inventory control and product quality, which led to cleanliness concerns. And our program offered some great products, technology to control the inventory, which allow them to focus more on their patients, instead of having a full run with trying to manage the microfiber. Excuse me. And then I've got a couple of other examples I thought might be helpful for the group. In our government sector, we have -- we just recently rolled out a first aid and AED rental program to a public library system in California, which is -- you wouldn't think of a public library system as being a great prospect for us, but it is. They realized that the value would bring to their employees and being prepared with the AEDs in case it was needed because the publics in their locations. And then lastly, I'll just share with you a little bit on education. A variety of wins there. We had a chemistry department at a nice-sized university in Virginia. They put all their educators and students in a lab tour program. The maintenance department at a University in California put all of their people in Carhartt uniforms, a rental program from us, they love the Carhartt. And then the last item would be there was a dining facility at a university in Arizona where they put all their culinary people in Chef Works, which is a big win for those folks. The branded programs with Carhartt and Chef Works were big wins. So, I don't want to belabor it, but I thought I would just share a few wins because I know verticals are of interest to yourself, Ashish, but also plenty of other folks on the call. Certainly. I think how -- one of the things we have around here is we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop. And -- so we're -- or the way Mike described it, in total for our company, we grew revenues over 9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure in total. So that means we're spending more time with the customer, less time driving, which is better for our customers, better for our partners, and better for Cintas. So we're pleased with that. Our technology and we still have plenty of room to go there. We're focused on bringing those efficiencies, extracting out the inefficiencies in our business. We sent out a note -- a press release regarding our migration this quarter to the Google Cloud, that has been very successful for us. There's a number of benefits that we get from moving from a server farm to the Google Cloud. The first one is it's more secure, so very important to us. Second item is, over time, we believe we will -- that'll be more cost-effective for us. And the third is it gives us access to Google's AI platform. So certainly in the very early innings, we just migrated, but we think that that will be able to help us longer term in making it more attractive, making it easier to do business with Cintas, making sure that we are positioning our people to be successful, to point them in the right direction and leverage that type of -- those types of tools. Good morning, Manav. Great question. As Mike said, we win in many ways. We have been selling no programmers since the inception of my career, I can tell you that, and we continue to. And I'll just remind you, there is -- we service a little over a million businesses, but there's 16 million businesses in the US and Canada, so there's plenty of opportunity there. And we like both. We certainly win some from the competitors. We like growing the pie. And then the examples I was giving, it's a mix. But in large part, it is -- they were either doing it in house, meaning they were processing microfibers in house, or they were telling their employees to go buy product. So there's different variations of no programmers, meaning some are just -- were buying products and providing to their people and telling them to wear them. Some of them, they were just telling them to show up to work and look good. But nevertheless, we bring so much better consistent program identification, cleanliness, all these and compliance are big drivers for our customers. Mike, I would just add that we think we're being really good fiduciaries of our shareholders' investments. Mike mentioned all the levers. And the net-net of that is we still have great dry powder, which allows us to take on M&A of all shapes and sizes and we're interested in that. Thanks for the question, Josh. Yeah, the cleanroom business is, it's an attractive sector for us. I mentioned pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and there's -- it seems like there's more and more every year that need that level of cleaning, that level of cleanliness. So, that is -- we think that bodes well for that business in the future. And there has been -- you've seen some momentum onshoring in that area. And we want to make sure that we have the appropriate capacity to serve our current customers and that we're prepared for the future as well. So, we like the trends in that business, and we like the business. Yeah. Great question. Yeah. So, we recognize that energy prices go up, they go down. But one thing that's going to be consistent is, we're going to be focused on extracting out inefficiencies in our route structure and in our production facilities. So, that will be really important to us. And we think there is certainly ample opportunity there still to go. We've talked about the SmartTruck technology, that's been impactful to us in many ways. But what's also impactful is, as Mike mentioned, our Six Sigma team of professionals, our Engineering professionals, and then layering in with that technology allows us to have a centralized visibility into our operations at a level that we've never had before in the history of the company this technology allows us. So -- and it allows us to maximize our labor, our equipment, ultimately our energy spend. So -- and we're focused on extracting out those inefficiencies, so that we can manage it moving forward. We love when energy goes -- costs go down, but we recognize those markets will move, but we're going to be focused on extracting out those inefficiencies. Well, Heather, it's a great question. I'll start. Mike, feel free to chime in. We're -- there's various reasons why a prospect would turn into a customer. Going from a no programmer to a customer. One of them is, hey, where we'd like to outsource it, because we're not very good at it or we're not -- we don't have -- we're struggling to staff and we're struggling to find people to manage this. So, that still continues. But there's other reasons. It might be, we don't like the image that we're portraying. We don't like the lack of identification. We don't like the lack of compliance. You can provide them, and we know that they're hygienically clean. So, there's many different motives. One of it might be, hey, we can't staff, and we need help. And we still see that, frankly. And it allows our customers to focus on what's most important to them, taking care of their customers, their patients, their guests, whatever it is, instead of having to manage through these various programs. Heather, it's a good question. We don't really discern the difference between our Six Sigma team, our Engineering team and our Technologies. They all have to work, be orchestrated appropriately to get the efficiencies, so -- and that's exactly what we're doing. So, everybody has to be involved. And that's what produces the great results. As for G&K, yeah, we're -- we now -- we're I think about six and a half years since we acquired, if my math is correct. So, yeah, I wouldn't say that there's anything left on the bone there. Thank you, Andy. George, we -- good morning, George. We -- forward-looking, as Mike said, there's always -- we're not trying to prognosticate exactly how our customers will react to the turning of the calendar year, but we're not seeing any change in sales cycles, and we haven't seen a change in our customer base and they're -- how they're reacting to what's going on in the marketplace. So, it's kind of business has been consistent, and it's more what Mike referred to the turn of the calendar year. And we'll see how businesses react coming out of the holidays. Yeah, George. Cross sell is -- it's an important component of our growth, and the nature of it is we're having good success across all of our areas of our business. We're blessed to be in a position where our customers, fortunately, they really like us. They like our relationships. We have people in their businesses on a really frequent basis, mostly on a weekly basis. So they -- and we have -- so that means we have eyes, ears, and minds in their business and we can help. And it doesn't matter to us what a customer might lead with, whatever they're interested in, but then we will quickly pivot and we can help them in many ways. So -- but just the nature of the size of the rental division is such that because there is -- are so many customers there, there's plenty of opportunity for our First Aid and Fire business to cross onto that just because of the numbers there. But nevertheless, it's working quite well across all of our organization. We share leads, we share thoughts, and we make sure that the customer is well taken care of. Yeah, good morning Tim. So our new business is robust. As I mentioned, retention levels are very good and our cross-sell is very good. And the pricing is still, it's lower than last year. It is higher than historical, but it's certainly getting much closer to historical. So -- but when you -- so when you think about that, it is -- our various inputs to growth are all performing well, and we expect that to continue. Thank you, Tim. You as well. Good morning, Andrew. Our ad stop metrics are -- have been pretty consistent. We haven't seen much of a change in our customer base. And so I'd say that's how I would describe it. We see still positive trends in our ad stop metrics, but that's pretty consistent as it has been for the last six to twelve months. Yes sir, thank you. Yeah, I'll start, Jasper. Good morning. Our -- we're seeing -- just like you're seeing with inflation in total, we're seeing that come down. It's never coming down as fast as we like, but we are seeing it. Cotton is stabilized. We're seeing freight come down and that's important to us. And the labor market is easier. It's still not easy, but it is easier. So I think that probably the right way to think about it would be as the labor market eases, and that will lessen pressure on wage growth as well. Good morning, Faiza. Thanks for the question. We really like the fire business. It's the only business we're in where you legally have to have it. So there is, I'll call it double negative, no program market. Everyone is a programmer. But we are able to cross-sell very well into that market. We're using various technologies that Mike referenced to make sure that we're positioning our partners to be more successful, meaning we use SmartTruck technology in all of our businesses, and that helps us. But we're getting leverage from our growth. And the growth is attractive. And we think it's \u2013 there's certainly -- running a business isn't linear. So there will be ebbs and flows, but we like the long-term outlook for the fire business. That being said, as you mentioned, we are going through an SAP implementation. We certainly -- we haven't even implemented at this point, so we haven't seen any benefits just yet, but we're optimistic about how that can help our business over the coming years. Well, I'll start, Faiza, with, our history has been we grow certainly in multiples of GDP and employment growth and you hit it. We are able to sell into no programmers. Even when they're not, let's say, adding people, we can take pressure off of them by managing programs for them. So our new business effort is always really good. But certainly, if we see turns in the economy, we've got to adjust potentially. If we see our customers start to reduce their number of people, we've got to adjust. And so it is prudent for us to sort of think about that as we look into our guidance and into the future of the business. Yeah, Seth, thank you for the question. As you know, that's a segment of the uniform market. As I mentioned earlier, it does seem more companies over the last decade or so have higher cleaning quality requirements, so we think there's a tailwind there. As far as the CapEx required for a facility like that, you can think of it as very similar to a uniform facility. The only difference I think that you may want to think about is, it serves usually a larger geographic area than we would with a traditional facility. And the reason being is we only have so many of them and they have to cover the customer base. So as a result of that, we do cover a larger geographic area for -- out of each of those facilities. Yeah, Seth, I wouldn't -- you're not going to see ones and twos coming out every quarter or every year based upon the size of the market. So it certainly won't be anywhere near that pace. But it will be paced based upon the demand from the marketplace. If there's more and more customers that are interested in it, then we'll be prepared to meet that demand. Good question, Seth. The design collective business, the direct sale portion of it, we've spoken in the past, it's certainly lumpier. And so as far as where that growth is coming from, it's really more national accounts, where we would get it, hospitality, lodging. And when they have rollouts or new allotment programs, you tend to get spikes. And then -- so we love the spikes and then the, what comes after the spike isn't as good, but I wouldn't think about it as a big growth engine for us. Good morning, Stephanie. Well, you can think about it -- we call it cross-sell. There's -- cross-sell is really division to division. There's also upsell which would be, we have products that our customers don't use all of our products, even within the rental division, or the first aid division, and what have you. So, those are all components of growth for us, and we see a significant, massive, frankly, runway in all those areas. So we're trying to position our employee partners to make sure that they're in the right spot and have the right information to help the customer. And then we're also continually, it's part of our corporate culture, is to invest in new products and new services. We're always working on that. And we get those ideas from those customers and then we test them and then we launch them and we're always working on that. It's always been a component of our growth and always will be. Thank you. Yeah. Good morning, Scott. We're -- the items that you mentioned, they're all really important to us. We are -- there's not one that I would call out, but I would think about it this way. We think the future's really bright and we want to invest for the future. We know we need the talent acquisition team to be attracting the very best talent. The management trainee programs are leaders of the future, and we think they are a critical pipeline, and we're going to need those leaders. And then the selling resources are, we see the -- it looks, we think the future's bright with our, how many customers we have, what the size of the market is. I mentioned 1 million customers, about 16 million businesses. So that's all great. And then you kind of wrap it all with technology, because technology will, we want to make it easier to do business with us, and we want to leverage technology to make our partners more successful. Point them in the right direction, give them the right tools in their toolbox to spend their time in the right spots, but also to make it easier for the customer to buy, easier to do business with in totality. One thing I might add is, to Mike's point, we get synergies. It helps us with density, helps us with capacity utilization, allows us to spend more time with the customers. So all that's valuable, but in each of the businesses, depending upon the business we acquire. But normally when we make an acquisition in rental, first aid, or fire, we're able to provide an offering to that customer base that's broader than what they had in the past. So the rental waiver broader offering than most companies out there, certainly in the first aid we do as well. And depending upon the [fire] (ph) acquisition, that's very consistent. Separate from, then we can cross sell. So it adds nice value. Good morning, Toni, thank you for the question. So we've had a long standing relationship with Carhartt and Chef Works, and we are the exclusive licensees for those folks, for those companies on the rental programs. And so we work with them to design products that the end users want, want to wear, and -- but also that goes very well through our processing systems. So that's all very important to us. As far as, we don't get into contractual arrangements with them, but I can tell you this. We love products that our end users are, that get excited about wearing them. And Carhartt and Chef Works are two great examples of that, in great companies, great brands, great products. And as far as are there other opportunities, we're constantly looking for that. And we spend a lot of time with our customers and with our working partners to talk about that and to see where those opportunities do come from. But those are two great relationships, long-standing relationships that are really important to us. I'd say, similar to products, we're always looking at those types of opportunities. We certainly know, stay in contact with the people that are running those businesses. But the great news is we don't have to do that to -- in order to be really, really successful in the future. We look at it and say there's, again, we're servicing about 1 million businesses. There's 16 million businesses in US and Canada. Here's what's really exciting is by the time we get to 2 million customers, there will be more than 16 million businesses in the US and Canada. So that's kind of a bummer if you're running a race but it's really exciting if you're running a business because once we get to the 2 mile mark, the race is going to be extended. So that's separate from -- we're going to have more products and services over the coming year. So all that being said is, we continue to watch it, we evaluate it, we look for the right opportunity, and if that opportunity presents itself, then we will seize it, but it's certainly not -- it's not required in order for us to be successful in the future."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our fiscal 2024 first quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our start to fiscal year 2024. First quarter total revenue grew 8.1% to $2.34 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flow through to our bottom line. Operating income margin increased 110 basis points to an all-time high of 21.4%, and diluted EPS grew 9.1% to $3.70.  I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.83 billion compared to $1.7 billion last year. Their organic revenue growth rate was 7.6%. While price increases moved near historical levels, revenue growth continues to be driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $260.7 million compared to $234.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11%. Our value proposition continues to resonate in our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind.  We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $254.8 million compared to $234.5 million last year.  The Fire business revenue was $174.3 million, and their organic revenue growth rate was 14.2%. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $80.5 million which was down 2.7% organically compared to last year. Now before I turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion to a range of $9.4 billion to $9.52 billion, a total growth rate of 6.6% to 8%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $13.85 to $14.35 to a range of $14 to $14.45, a growth rate of 7.8% to 11.2%. Mike?\nMichael Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 first quarter revenue was $2.34 billion compared to $2.17 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 11%.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue was an all-time high of 48.7% for the first quarter of fiscal '24, compared to 47.5% last year, an increase of 120 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this record gross margin. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 50 basis points from last year.  Please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies we've created with our proprietary SmartTruck technology. Certainly, we've also seen a benefit from a drop in prices at the pump compared to a year ago. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 55.9% for First Aid and Safety Services, 49% for Fire Protection Services and 38.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $500.6 million compared to $440.1 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.4% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.3% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 19.2% compared to 14.8% last year.  The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the first quarter was $385.1 million compared to $351.7 million last year. This year's first quarter diluted EPS of $3.70 compared to $3.39 last year, an increase of 9.1%.  Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter grew 13% over the prior year. On September 15, we paid shareholders $138.3 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.8% from the amount paid the previous September. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt; our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23.  The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. Guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. Jared?\nJared Mattingley: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow up if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy: I wanted to see if you could provide a bit more color on the new business environment. And if you've noticed any change in terms of the macro environment. Certainly, you guys are talking to your customers every day. So just a bit more perspective around what you're seeing out there in the marketplace.\nTodd Schneider: Great. Yes, our new business pipeline is quite good. We love the state of our sales organization, the focus that they have, the scope. And so new business is quite good, and that's a big driver of our growth that you're seeing and we see that continuing. As far as macro environment, it is -- we haven't seen any real change in our customers' behavior, I would say, since we reported last.  So it's pretty consistent with what we have seen over the past few quarters. And we are watching it very, very closely and monitoring it as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more color, I think, in terms of the pricing strategy and then also the strong volume growth. So I think you said pricing is back to historical levels. So I'm guessing that's down in that low single-digit camp versus almost every other company talking about still, I guess, pricing higher than above and average. So it just maybe the first question is just how do we think about your pricing strategy here?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, it is certainly closer to historical levels, and we like that. That's, we think, appropriate based upon our cost inputs. But we're very proud of the fact that we're growing our business attractively, and we think we can continue this based upon new business being robust and our customer retention levels, being very good as well.  And we're seeing that in our customer satisfaction scores as well. And then the status of our customers is -- they're continuing on in the operating environment as they have in the past. So we like where we're positioned. We like the momentum in our business, and we like how we're growing it as well, and we think it's -- it bodes well for the future.\nMichael Hansen: Manav, I might just add -- Manav, I might just add to that, you asked about our pricing strategy. And as we've talked in the past, our goal is operating margin improvement, right? And pricing can be a lever within that, but we have other levers. It's not the only way for us to improve margins.  And so as we think about the operating margin strategy of increasing, we've got a lot of good things going on. And this is a great quarter that shows where pricing is sort of returning back to that historical level. We still increased margins quite nicely even to record levels. And again, it's just that pricing is a part of that strategy.\nManav Patnaik: Yes, that make sense. That's quite impressive. And then maybe just on the strong volume growth. Could you just help provide some color on how much of that is new business, cross-selling, maybe share gains? Any color around that?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Good question, Manav. I mean, it's everything. As I mentioned, our new is quite good. Our retention levels, we're very happy with, and we're cross-selling. And we've -- we're continuing to make good progress there. We're never satisfied. But our value proposition is resonating with our customers, and we're trying to make it easier to do business with us through various technologies. And I think it's showing up in our results, and we're again bullish.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS.\nJoshua Chan: I guess could I ask about inflation and what you're seeing across your different cost buckets, labor, energy, material? And how you expect that to kind of transpire over the coming quarters as well?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, I'll start, and Mike wants to chime in as well. Yes, so what we're seeing from an input cost standpoint, labor is still higher than historical. But to Mike's point earlier, we're finding ways to improve operating margin in that environment still. And part of it is because productivity is quite attractive.  And we're trying to position our employee partners so that they can be more successful in the marketplace, which is good for them and it's good for ourselves. And obviously, with that retention levels of our employee partners being much back -- very close to historical levels. That's good for our customers as well.  Other input costs, you saw where energy was down year over prior. That is really a Q1 subject because if you recall last year, the price at the pump was very high. And so we got a little bit of a tailwind there. But we think that will be pretty muted through the balance of the fiscal year.  And then last, material costs. Our global supply chain team is doing one heck of a job in trying to make sure that we're well positioned to have very competitive prices and access to all that product. And we've spoken in the past about how a very small percentage of our products are single sourced. So that positions us well as far as having access to product, but also being giving them at very competitive rates.\nJoshua Chan: And I guess for my follow-up, could you talk about what your CapEx expectations are this year and kind of the types of projects that you're investing in?\nMichael Hansen: Sure. We did see a little bit of an increase in CapEx in Q1. We are -- as we've talked, we are in the midst of implementing SAP for our Fire Protection business and that adds a little bit of CapEx. In the first quarter, we also saw -- over the last couple of years, supply chains, our vendors have had some disruption in their ability to deliver trucks being the best example.  And in the first quarter, we saw a little bit of a catch-up in terms of us receiving more of those trucks. And so we saw a bit of an increase there too in the first quarter. I expect for the year that we're going to likely be right around 4%. Longer term, we still believe 3.5% to 4%. But because of SAP and sort of that catch-up might be a little closer to 4% this year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky: I was hoping, first, you could talk about your exposure to the auto sector and any exposure you may have to, I guess, some of the current disruption? And then two, if you could talk about through the end markets, are there any areas where just in this macro, you're seeing softness and areas where you're seeing strength would be great?\nTodd Schneider: Heather. Yes, we're certainly watching what's going on with the auto worker strike, but it is not affecting us in any material way whatsoever. We have a very broad-based customer base. And as a result of that, it's not affecting us to any material degree whatsoever.  And keeping in mind that we have no one customer that's greater than 1% of our revenue and no even sector that's greater than 10% for 3-digit NAICS codes. So that helps us and insulates us a bit from all that. As far as the macro environment, it really -- it varies based upon the sector, geography, whether they're goods producing or services providing. But the labor market is a little easier, but still not easy.  And you see that through the -- what we've -- what we're reading with the job openings, still 9.5 million job openings. And that affects our customer base from a standpoint of them trying to attract and retain people. We would love to see those jobs filled because we think that would be really good for our customers and for the economy in general.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Justin Hauke from RW Baird.\nJustin Hauke: I wanted to ask about the First Aid margins because it kind of sustainably been higher than they have been historically and really more comparable to the Uniform Rental and the Facility Services segment. And I guess the question is, I mean, for years, that was kind of a scale business where you were building it out and it had lower margins. Are you at the point now where like that business has reached a point where it has very comparable margin sustainably to the Uniform Rental business?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, we really like the First Aid business. I mean it's -- that it resonates with our customer base. They -- a strong value proposition is helping our revenue growth. The mix has returned closer to historical with First Aid and Safety. And Justin, just like our other businesses, we're using various technologies to extract inefficiencies out of our business.  And there's certainly no exception to that. I mentioned that our global supply chain team has done -- doing a great job in sourcing product, and we're benefiting from sourcing there. But yes, we see -- certainly, there is -- running a business is not linear. But that being said, we certainly think that gross margins in excess of 50 are sustainable in that business.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. Great. And then I guess the last one is kind of more procedural, I guess. But you did -- it looks like on the cash flow about $56 million spending on acquisitions in the quarter, which is a little bit higher than what you guys typically do. Do you have any comments on kind of where that was, where we should see the revenue flow from it?\nTodd Schneider: Well, I'll start, and Mike can chime in. The -- Justin, as you know, we love leveraging our balance sheet for M&A. And we think it's a great use of cash, and we're very happy with the fact that we were able to deploy some of the cash to leverage that opportunity. And we are acquisitive in all 3 of our operating segments that are route-based. And we made acquisitions in all 3, so -- in Q1. So we're pleased with that, and we think that will -- is a great opportunity for us to bring those customers into the fold, those partners, those employee partners into the fold and provide more value and cross-sell to those customers that are now part of Cintas.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: In the past, you've talked about strong demand from the health care, education and government verticals in driving Uniform Rental's growth. Can you discuss the latest trends you're seeing in these end markets and what's fueling the growth?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, those are 3 great verticals for us. I mean, they're 3 great segments of the North American economy. And so, yes, we're still seeing outsized growth in those markets. And as we've chatted about in the past, it's more than just a sales effort. We've organized around them. We've got products for them. We've got technologies for them.  And that is resonating with that customer base. So we think we've chosen them quite well, and there's plenty of runway in all of them. So we're, again, quite bullish on the future of those segments.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. And then with respect to margins, your gross margins expanded 60 bps year-over-year in your Uniform segment. Most of that appears to be driven by lower energy costs. Can you discuss puts and takes around Uniform gross margins in the quarter and opportunities for additional margin expansion over the remainder of this year that comes above and beyond tailwinds you're seeing from lower energy costs?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. George, we're -- the nature of the math around our businesses, the Rental business is obviously a large percentage of it. And we're guiding towards margin expansion for the year. And we do not see energy being a tailwind for the balance of the year.  So we expect margin expansion based upon certainly leverage on revenue growth, that's going to be helpful. But we're extracting those inefficiencies out of our business. And as Mike mentioned earlier, we're proud of the fact that pricing is returning back to historical levels, but we're still able to grow operating margin -- gross margin and operating margin at very attractive levels and to levels that are all-time highs. So that's part of our plan. And our team is actually treating at a very high level, and we expect that, that will continue.\nMichael Hansen: George, I might just reiterate what I mentioned in the prepared remarks that keeping in mind that the energy benefit that we are getting is partly because we are working really hard at things like our SmartTruck initiative. So in other words, as we continue to grow really nicely with volumes, we don't need to add as many routes and trucks as we have in the past, and that creates then better fuel efficiency, if you will, throughout our network. And so that's a -- it is a proactive initiative to get energy down. And one of those proactive ways is through that SmartTruck technology.\nTodd Schneider: And Mike, I might add that when we extract those inefficiencies out, that's better for our customers because we're able to spend more time in front of them instead of on the road. It's certainly better for our partners, our employee partners because it makes them that much more productive, and that's good for them and our organization.  And it's really good for the environment. So we think -- let's say there's a lot of boxes checked there, and we've worked hard on that technology over the years, and it's showing up. And it's benefiting not just the P&L in a more simplistic fashion, but in many ways.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair.\nSamuel Kusswurm: This is Sam Kusswurm on for Tim. I guess I want to start with another health care question here. But as it relates to your health care clients, you've talked a lot about the opportunity here, especially as more no programmers convert. But I guess I'd like to know for those health care operators who already use a service partner, what do you think your penetration rate is? And how might that compare to some of your other customer verticals?\nTodd Schneider: Sam, that's a good question. I don't have that in front of me. But we know this. We're in the early innings with health care. And we're coming up with more products and services that they find attractive. And that's part of our culture. We will enter into a business. But then we get out from behind our desk and we go spend time with our customers.  And when we find that we find the answers to what they are most interested in by speaking to them, and our customers and our employee partners. And we're hearing from them on various areas where we can help them, and we're taking action there. So again, a very long runway in that vertical, and that's again part of our culture and will be part of how we go to market moving forward.\nSamuel Kusswurm: Got you. Appreciate it. Maybe just another quick one on the margins. I see SG&A as a percentage of sales picked up again in the quarter compared to last year. I guess I'm wondering if there was any variable costs like your insurance expenses? Or if it was mainly some of the selling and branding investments you've talked about previously? Maybe you could just help break that out for us a little more.\nMichael Hansen: Nothing unusual in the quarter. We did see the -- we talked in the fourth quarter about some claims getting higher, but not structural. We saw those come back down to something more normal. But as it relates to the quarter, just some puts and takes, nothing of any significance. Our goal is to continue to leverage particularly the G&A piece of that, and we're going to continue to work at that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities.\nAndrew Steinerman: I wanted to talk to you about incremental margins, which were super strong in the quarter and last quarter on a year-over-year basis. I surely know, Cintas historically has targeted 20% to 30% as a range for incremental margins. But kind of given where we are right now, it definitely feels like that kind of low end of the range, the 20%, might not be as appropriate. And so my question is, has your medium-term range for incremental margins been creeping up?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. 20% to 30% is our target. We -- Q1 was a very attractive incremental margins. And there's always puts and takes in every quarter as I mentioned. Running a business is not linear. But we will expect that we will be in that 20% to 30% range. I certainly like higher in the range than lower. And we are -- and I think our guide speaks to where attractive margin improvement for the year as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo.\nSeth Weber: I wanted to ask just about the small tick down in Uniform Direct Sales organic growth here in the quarter. It's the first, I think, decline that we've seen there in a while. I know the comp was hard. Is there anything else that you'd call out there for that business?\nTodd Schneider: Certainly, what we have seen outstanding performance from that business over the past really 2 years. And -- but it is -- as we've spoken about in the past, the Uniform Direct Sale business tends to be a little bit lumpier based upon rollouts of large programs, whether it's hospitality or a Fortune 1000-type customer. So nothing more than that. We still are bullish on the future of that business and for the year and moving forward.\nSeth Weber: Do you think, Todd, do you think that business could be up for the year? Or do you think that's kind of flattish or down?\nTodd Schneider: I would suspect -- well, we expect all of our businesses to grow. So I would suspect that we would see that up. But just the comps are set with the level of what we dealt with hospitality in that vertical, in Fortune 1000, the level of where employees came back so strongly. I wouldn't suspect that you'll see anywhere near the level of growth that we've seen in the last couple of years, but we expect it to grow.\nMichael Hansen: Seth, I might point out that the last 2 years have -- they have been a significant recapture of what we sort of lost in that pandemic period of time. In our fiscal '22, that business grew organically over 50%; in fiscal '23, it was almost 30%. So there was a lot of recapture going on, but keep in mind that our longer-term goal for that business, Todd expects it to grow, but it's probably more of a low single-digit to mid-single-digit grower in our portfolio.\nSeth Weber: Right. Okay. Understood. And then maybe just on the First Aid and Safety business, given the margin strength that you're seeing there, can you talk about are you seeing any incremental competition in that space? Are you seeing any bigger players trying to get into that space or just smaller regional players getting more active?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Good question, Seth. Certainly, it's a very competitive marketplace and First Aid products, Safety products, there is hundreds of competitors out there. There's many, many ways to procure those products, whether it be van delivered or e-commerce, you name it, we see it there.  But as a result of that, it's a very competitive market. And we've talked about the health and safety of employees being the #1 item that businesses are focused on. And when that occurs, there's certainly -- it attracts plenty of people into the marketplace because the value proposition of taking great care of employees is resonating with folks. And so yes, it's a very competitive environment, and I'm sure it will continue to be.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.\nStephanie Moore: Actually, maybe continuing on that last question there. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape and your more core Uniform ancillary product segment? As you continue to win new business, where are you seeing the majority of that new business coming from? Is it nonprogrammers, some of the regional players, larger players? Any color there would be helpful.\nTodd Schneider: So I've been in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business my entire career, 34 years. It's been highly competitive my entire career, and I'm sure it will continue to be that way. But we haven't seen a change in the landscape. It's always really competitive. So that being said, we -- our sales organization is highly skilled. And what we know is, there is a massive opportunity with the no program market.  And for years, our organization has been focused on expanding the pie, and they are continuing to do exactly that. And when we talk about expanding the pie, they are -- those employees at a no programmer mean -- they're wearing garments, right? It's -- but they are -- they may be buying it themselves. They may be buying it through a catalog, it might be a centralized program for the company, but they're purchasing them.  And then we provide more value to them with the products and services that we offer, whether they're unique products like Carhartt or Chef Works or Landau, great branded programs. But the no-program market is really attractive for us, and we find that market sees really good value in what we're offering. So we're focused on expanding that high, and that will continue.\nStephanie Moore: Got it. And just a follow-up, if I may. You noted that retention level continue to be really high. I'm just curious, in this current environment, what do you think is resonating the most with your customers that your sales force kind of goes in? Is it kind of the willingness to work with them on price? Is it the product offering, your scale? I'd love to just get your thoughts on what do you think is resonating the most to drive such a nice retention level.\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Great question, Stephanie. That's a very complicated answer because there's so many inputs to it. But it starts with being highly focused on taking incredibly good care of our customers and attracting and retaining the very best people. But then giving them product, services, tools so that they can not only have the intent to take great care of our customers, but do just exactly that.  So -- and that gets into great products that I mentioned earlier, the service -- focus that we -- or the tools that we're making that make it easier to do business with us. But it gets down to our people and positioning them to take a really, really good care of our customers and then executing on that. And they're executing at a really high level.  And we talk often about when markets -- when things are challenging, when it's hard to attract people, when it's hard to procure products, when it's hard to operate in the marketplace, it gives us a chance to shine. And our culture is shining through. And our people are doing one heck of a job in taking care of our customers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: Guys, you've certainly -- it sounds like you really want to speak to a SmartTruck because that's been going very well. I was hoping you could add also on automation to facilities. And where I'm going here, just kind of an update on where I'm going here is it sounds like you've been getting nice efficiencies and you still see more room to run.  Is there any quantification you can put on that? I know you're looking for margins up this year overall business. But maybe just help us get an idea of what's at play there and how much you can do.\nTodd Schneider: Scott, I'll start. Mike, if you would like to chime in there. We're deploying technology, and you can call it automation, you can call it technology, you can call it digital. We're deploying that across all of our businesses and across all areas of our business as well, and we've been focused on that for years.  But there certainly is -- we're seeing some real benefits there with our investment with SAP, with our investments -- our partnerships with Google and with Verizon. And it's -- those are -- we see that there's plenty of opportunities still to come there to improve in the efficiencies of our business and to automate certain functions.  And we call it -- make it easier for our customers to do business and make it easier for our employee partners to take great care of our customers. The more we can invest there, we think it's an incredibly good use of our balance sheet because it positions us well for not just the short term, but the long term as well.\nMichael Hansen: Yes. There are so many details that go into all of the things that Todd just talked about, that it's really hard to put a number on it. Our goal is, as you've heard us say, is continue to improve margins. We have a number of different levers to do so. Our goal is incrementals in that 20% to 30% range, recognizing we're at the bottom of that range today.  But it's hard to put a specific number on what's left because we're always working on what's -- what more can we do. And there are so many details and so many different projects we're working on. So our guide certainly does imply for continued margin improvement over last year, and that's the way we think about it.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Appreciate that. The -- you just referenced SAP, and you mentioned CapEx may be high end of the range this year, working on some implementation in the Fire segment. Could you just speak to -- would that have a tail to next year? How much more -- I mean, are we going to see SAP projects for years to come? Just a sense of what you have on the spend side going forward.\nMichael Hansen: From a Fire perspective, the -- we are in the midst of the early innings of the implementation. And so we'll see some pressure in the Fire margins a little bit this year and a little bit next year. The synergies and the benefits don't come overnight. It's not a flip of the switch.  And so we -- just like we did with the Rental business and the First Aid business before that, we need to get onto the platform. It takes a little bit of time to get really good at using the platform, and then we really start to see the benefits accelerate just like we have in First Aid and Rental. Now that's a -- Fire is a smaller part of our business, but we certainly expect that those benefits will come.  As it relates to SAP, SAP is not -- it's a journey, right? And we are -- even though we are on SAP and will be for most of our business after the Fire Protection business gets on, there are constant things to learn from SAP. There are new initiatives in working with SAP and Google and Verizon that create new and different things. And so we look at this -- I think Todd's talked about it as one of his largest initiatives in terms of technology.  And it's a journey. It's not a flip of the switch. We turn on new systems here and there. So we're in the midst of that. We'll continue to invest in all of that. And our expectation is, it's going to continue to bring benefits into the future.\nTodd Schneider: Scott, to expand upon what Mike said, it is a journey. But when you're on that journey, there is benefits -- a long, long tail of benefits as well. And so we will continue to invest appropriately. We have relationships at a very high level in each of those organizations, and it's going to bear fruit for us. And that's part of our plan.  It's not easy. It's very challenging to go through these processes. But our team has shown the wherewithal to not only digest the change, but then leverage the opportunities that are in front of them.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Todd, maybe you can just peel the onion back a little bit more on that margin on the First Aid side? I know you pointed to some sourcing and stuff like that. But it seems like the business has gone from mid-teens to low 20s in the course of the year. And I was wondering if there -- is there something to do with the route optimization?  Is it mix related, pricing? Anything else that operationally made such a significant difference? And after that, I have just a question on the labor environment for you guys yourselves? Are you -- is it easier for you guys to source people for what you need?\nTodd Schneider: Good question, Shlomo. Yes. Again, we love the First Aid business. But we're -- there's so many inputs to margin expansion, and we're leveraging them all. It starts with really good revenue growth, and we're seeing that. And that's in a big way because the value proposition is resonating, the products, the services that we offer in the marketplace, trying to attract and retain people is still challenging.  And people are trying to -- customers are trying to take really good care of their people. And we're benefiting from that and we're helping them accomplish exactly that. We're helping them run their business better. So that's helpful. The mix, as you know, has -- back during the pandemic, it was certainly so much more focused on safety products, a lot of clubs and a lot of sanitizer and those types of items.  And that has abated a bit, and the mix is back focused on First Aid and those types of products, more recurring revenue type. And yes, we are absolutely leveraging technology to make it easier to do business, but also to position our partners, our employee partners to provide more value to our customers.  And SmartTruck is a component of that. We did have a little bit of energy tailwind, 40 basis points. But as Mike cited earlier, not all that's because of the price at the pump. That is also because we are extracting the inefficiencies out. And we always talk around here about how we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop.  That's better for our customers, that's better for our employee partners. And all that is contributing. And then lastly, as I mentioned, our supply chain team has done a great job. They are leveraging the opportunities there. The larger we get in that business, the more leverage they have, and they're executing at a high level.  And -- so many inputs that are contributing to it, and -- but the -- what's really encouraging is, we see those having an opportunity to continue in the future. So certainly, no event is more of a process.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: And then just the labor environment on your own, like for the people that you're sourcing?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Pardon me. So from a labor standpoint, yes. As I mentioned earlier, it is easier, but not easy. And we are looking for great people. We want to hire not only people that are employed somewhere else, but happily employed, which is very challenging. And -- but we think we have a great employee value proposition as well.  And so we're highly focused on that. So -- but yes, easier than it was a year ago. But Shlomo, throughout my career, it's always been challenging. It's a little bit more challenging than it has been historically, but not what it once was a year ago or so.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: I know there's a lot of questions and maybe thoughts on what happens to new sales. And I'm wondering, if you go back to kind of 2008, 2009 and hopefully never have that recession again. But if you look at new sales back then, how did Cintas perform for new sales? And any lessons from that you would take as we move forward?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Kartik. First of all, we're a really different company today than we were in 2008, 2009. We have a much more diversified customer base. We're now -- today 70% of our customers are service is providing, 30% are goods producing. We have significant verticals that we didn't have as well, health care, education, government.  So we think we're really well positioned for whenever the next recession is. And I remember '08, '09 because I was running the sales organization back then. And our value propositions still resonated with people, and we still sold new business. And we did so at attractive rates. As I mentioned, it's not always are we asking for new money. Sometimes it's just a redirection of those from somewhere else to us, not only in a -- maybe a direct competitor standpoint, but also they're purchasing clothing, they're purchasing items to take care of the facilities. So we think we're well positioned. I might also mention, you didn't ask specifically about it, but we love having a pristine balance sheet. And we think whenever the next recession is that might open up opportunities for us. And just the fact that we've -- our organization is focused on fighting through whatever the economic environment is, taking great care of our customers, taking great care of our employee partners.  And we've grown sales in 52 of the last 54 years. And we suspect that whatever the economic environment is, we believe we're going to be successful in it.\nMichael Hansen: Kartik, I might add, Todd might be a little modest. He was running that organization. It was a difficult environment, and he and the sales team exceeded their internal goals and really continued to show that value even in tough times, as Todd mentioned. And as he also talked about, our customer base is quite a bit broader than it was back then, and our sales team is a little bit different.  But the really good news is even back then, in the deepest, longest, broadest recession we'd seen in 100 years, we still sold a lot of new business. And it's a nice reflection of the value proposition that we have.\nKartik Mehta: Yes. And just as a follow-up, if you look at the First Aid and Safety business, you're doing really well in it. Is there a way you would look at to say a certain percentage is recurring? Do you consider a certain percentage recurring? I know you don't have long-term contracts in that business. But just from a demand standpoint and what you've seen from a historical standpoint?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Kartik, it's a good question. I don't have that in front of me, but I know it's -- it has returned much closer to historical or even higher as far as what we see from a repeat -- recurring type of revenue. And we want to provide value to the customers, whatever product services they want. It's just the nature of it, what we provide, whether it be First Aid supplies, access to AEDs, access to eyewash stations, access to clean water through our WaterBreak offering.  Those are all items that are really important to our customers more so today than they were pre-pandemic, and we think that, that trend will continue.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: So one of your competitors has been talking about using a strategy where they're incentivizing their drivers to cross-sell products. Can you talk about why you don't use that strategy? What the disadvantages are that you have found when doing that?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Great question, Toni. I'm glad you asked because my first job 34 years ago was on the trucks. And we have been cross-selling our products via our -- we call them our service sales representatives. We've been cross-selling them since I started, and I'm sure it was in place well before I started as well. So we see -- the fact that we have 12,000 or so trucks that roll out of our parking lots every single day that are focused on taking great care of our customers, when they roll out of those parking lots, they're spending time in those businesses.  And they have eyes. They have ears, they have minds, and they see what's going on in those businesses, and they see opportunities. And it always has been and always will be a key component of our growth trajectory because we see that infrastructure as a real advantage. And we leverage it and make sure that those service providers, either they provide more products and services or they provide a lead to provide more products and services based upon the nature of the product that the customer might be interested in.\nMichael Hansen: And Toni, we've talked a lot about this over the last -- more than 10 years, we've got customers of all different sizes, verticals, et cetera. And so while we do certainly expect those service sales reps to continue to penetrate and sell, we recognize that some businesses are just more complex than others, are larger than others.  And so sometimes, there's a strategy to enhance that opportunity. And it might be through, for example, in health care. We have dedicated people that really do reach out to the decision makers. So it's not just the service sales rep, but it's also other people that have relationship responsibilities that are looking for those new and different penetration opportunities.  It's not as simple just to simply say we're going to go in and have a service sales rep or an SSR go into each customer and sell it, all customers are so different. And so we need a strategy that can attack all types of customers, and we do.\nTodd Schneider: Toni, we know that our customer satisfaction scores are really good. And in large part because they really like our people. They like our service providers, our frontline service providers. And we leverage that. And whether it be, as Mike mentioned, a more -- a smaller type customer, we can cross-sell via the service provider. A larger one that's a little bit more complicated.  There might be a need for some air cover, for some help there. But nevertheless, that's always been an important component of our strategy and always will be.\nToni Kaplan: That is super helpful. I wanted to also ask, I think the last few calls, you've been talking more about technology and investments and things of this sort. Are there any, I guess, technology capabilities that you think you still need? Will -- that you either are getting through hiring technology people or maybe even doing M&A? Like -- and maybe you've done it, maybe you still have yet to do, but are there any technology capabilities that you need that basically would be helped through M&A or hiring internally new technology people?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Toni, great question. So we are always on the lookout for those opportunities. We think we have a really strong technology platform that we can build off of. But we know that the answer for what our customers are interested in is with spending time with our customers, and our employee partners are the ones who discern those opportunities.  So we're always asking now, how do we make it easier to do business, what -- is there any void? And frankly, that's where most of our investments have come from, that information, been trying to make it easier to do business with us. So we're always in search of trying to be a world-class service provider, but having an incredibly strong technology platform that makes it easier for our customers to do business with us, that makes it easier for our employee partners, our service providers to create a world-class experience for those customers. So yes, we're in search of whether it's -- we buy it or we bolt it on to our current platform or we created ourselves, all of those are of interest to us, and we'll be moving forward.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared Mattingley for closing remarks.\nJared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '24 financial results in December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Schneider",
            "content": "Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our start to fiscal year 2024. First quarter total revenue grew 8.1% to $2.34 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flow through to our bottom line. Operating income margin increased 110 basis points to an all-time high of 21.4%, and diluted EPS grew 9.1% to $3.70.  I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.83 billion compared to $1.7 billion last year. Their organic revenue growth rate was 7.6%. While price increases moved near historical levels, revenue growth continues to be driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $260.7 million compared to $234.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11%. Our value proposition continues to resonate in our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind.  We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $254.8 million compared to $234.5 million last year.  The Fire business revenue was $174.3 million, and their organic revenue growth rate was 14.2%. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $80.5 million which was down 2.7% organically compared to last year. Now before I turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion to a range of $9.4 billion to $9.52 billion, a total growth rate of 6.6% to 8%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $13.85 to $14.35 to a range of $14 to $14.45, a growth rate of 7.8% to 11.2%. Mike? Great. Yes, our new business pipeline is quite good. We love the state of our sales organization, the focus that they have, the scope. And so new business is quite good, and that's a big driver of our growth that you're seeing and we see that continuing. As far as macro environment, it is -- we haven't seen any real change in our customers' behavior, I would say, since we reported last.  So it's pretty consistent with what we have seen over the past few quarters. And we are watching it very, very closely and monitoring it as we move forward. Yes, it is certainly closer to historical levels, and we like that. That's, we think, appropriate based upon our cost inputs. But we're very proud of the fact that we're growing our business attractively, and we think we can continue this based upon new business being robust and our customer retention levels, being very good as well.  And we're seeing that in our customer satisfaction scores as well. And then the status of our customers is -- they're continuing on in the operating environment as they have in the past. So we like where we're positioned. We like the momentum in our business, and we like how we're growing it as well, and we think it's -- it bodes well for the future. Yes. Good question, Manav. I mean, it's everything. As I mentioned, our new is quite good. Our retention levels, we're very happy with, and we're cross-selling. And we've -- we're continuing to make good progress there. We're never satisfied. But our value proposition is resonating with our customers, and we're trying to make it easier to do business with us through various technologies. And I think it's showing up in our results, and we're again bullish. Yes, I'll start, and Mike wants to chime in as well. Yes, so what we're seeing from an input cost standpoint, labor is still higher than historical. But to Mike's point earlier, we're finding ways to improve operating margin in that environment still. And part of it is because productivity is quite attractive.  And we're trying to position our employee partners so that they can be more successful in the marketplace, which is good for them and it's good for ourselves. And obviously, with that retention levels of our employee partners being much back -- very close to historical levels. That's good for our customers as well.  Other input costs, you saw where energy was down year over prior. That is really a Q1 subject because if you recall last year, the price at the pump was very high. And so we got a little bit of a tailwind there. But we think that will be pretty muted through the balance of the fiscal year.  And then last, material costs. Our global supply chain team is doing one heck of a job in trying to make sure that we're well positioned to have very competitive prices and access to all that product. And we've spoken in the past about how a very small percentage of our products are single sourced. So that positions us well as far as having access to product, but also being giving them at very competitive rates. Heather. Yes, we're certainly watching what's going on with the auto worker strike, but it is not affecting us in any material way whatsoever. We have a very broad-based customer base. And as a result of that, it's not affecting us to any material degree whatsoever.  And keeping in mind that we have no one customer that's greater than 1% of our revenue and no even sector that's greater than 10% for 3-digit NAICS codes. So that helps us and insulates us a bit from all that. As far as the macro environment, it really -- it varies based upon the sector, geography, whether they're goods producing or services providing. But the labor market is a little easier, but still not easy.  And you see that through the -- what we've -- what we're reading with the job openings, still 9.5 million job openings. And that affects our customer base from a standpoint of them trying to attract and retain people. We would love to see those jobs filled because we think that would be really good for our customers and for the economy in general. Yes, we really like the First Aid business. I mean it's -- that it resonates with our customer base. They -- a strong value proposition is helping our revenue growth. The mix has returned closer to historical with First Aid and Safety. And Justin, just like our other businesses, we're using various technologies to extract inefficiencies out of our business.  And there's certainly no exception to that. I mentioned that our global supply chain team has done -- doing a great job in sourcing product, and we're benefiting from sourcing there. But yes, we see -- certainly, there is -- running a business is not linear. But that being said, we certainly think that gross margins in excess of 50 are sustainable in that business. Well, I'll start, and Mike can chime in. The -- Justin, as you know, we love leveraging our balance sheet for M&A. And we think it's a great use of cash, and we're very happy with the fact that we were able to deploy some of the cash to leverage that opportunity. And we are acquisitive in all 3 of our operating segments that are route-based. And we made acquisitions in all 3, so -- in Q1. So we're pleased with that, and we think that will -- is a great opportunity for us to bring those customers into the fold, those partners, those employee partners into the fold and provide more value and cross-sell to those customers that are now part of Cintas. Yes, those are 3 great verticals for us. I mean, they're 3 great segments of the North American economy. And so, yes, we're still seeing outsized growth in those markets. And as we've chatted about in the past, it's more than just a sales effort. We've organized around them. We've got products for them. We've got technologies for them.  And that is resonating with that customer base. So we think we've chosen them quite well, and there's plenty of runway in all of them. So we're, again, quite bullish on the future of those segments. Yes. George, we're -- the nature of the math around our businesses, the Rental business is obviously a large percentage of it. And we're guiding towards margin expansion for the year. And we do not see energy being a tailwind for the balance of the year.  So we expect margin expansion based upon certainly leverage on revenue growth, that's going to be helpful. But we're extracting those inefficiencies out of our business. And as Mike mentioned earlier, we're proud of the fact that pricing is returning back to historical levels, but we're still able to grow operating margin -- gross margin and operating margin at very attractive levels and to levels that are all-time highs. So that's part of our plan. And our team is actually treating at a very high level, and we expect that, that will continue. And Mike, I might add that when we extract those inefficiencies out, that's better for our customers because we're able to spend more time in front of them instead of on the road. It's certainly better for our partners, our employee partners because it makes them that much more productive, and that's good for them and our organization.  And it's really good for the environment. So we think -- let's say there's a lot of boxes checked there, and we've worked hard on that technology over the years, and it's showing up. And it's benefiting not just the P&L in a more simplistic fashion, but in many ways. Sam, that's a good question. I don't have that in front of me. But we know this. We're in the early innings with health care. And we're coming up with more products and services that they find attractive. And that's part of our culture. We will enter into a business. But then we get out from behind our desk and we go spend time with our customers.  And when we find that we find the answers to what they are most interested in by speaking to them, and our customers and our employee partners. And we're hearing from them on various areas where we can help them, and we're taking action there. So again, a very long runway in that vertical, and that's again part of our culture and will be part of how we go to market moving forward. Yes. 20% to 30% is our target. We -- Q1 was a very attractive incremental margins. And there's always puts and takes in every quarter as I mentioned. Running a business is not linear. But we will expect that we will be in that 20% to 30% range. I certainly like higher in the range than lower. And we are -- and I think our guide speaks to where attractive margin improvement for the year as well. Certainly, what we have seen outstanding performance from that business over the past really 2 years. And -- but it is -- as we've spoken about in the past, the Uniform Direct Sale business tends to be a little bit lumpier based upon rollouts of large programs, whether it's hospitality or a Fortune 1000-type customer. So nothing more than that. We still are bullish on the future of that business and for the year and moving forward. I would suspect -- well, we expect all of our businesses to grow. So I would suspect that we would see that up. But just the comps are set with the level of what we dealt with hospitality in that vertical, in Fortune 1000, the level of where employees came back so strongly. I wouldn't suspect that you'll see anywhere near the level of growth that we've seen in the last couple of years, but we expect it to grow. Yes. Good question, Seth. Certainly, it's a very competitive marketplace and First Aid products, Safety products, there is hundreds of competitors out there. There's many, many ways to procure those products, whether it be van delivered or e-commerce, you name it, we see it there.  But as a result of that, it's a very competitive market. And we've talked about the health and safety of employees being the #1 item that businesses are focused on. And when that occurs, there's certainly -- it attracts plenty of people into the marketplace because the value proposition of taking great care of employees is resonating with folks. And so yes, it's a very competitive environment, and I'm sure it will continue to be. So I've been in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business my entire career, 34 years. It's been highly competitive my entire career, and I'm sure it will continue to be that way. But we haven't seen a change in the landscape. It's always really competitive. So that being said, we -- our sales organization is highly skilled. And what we know is, there is a massive opportunity with the no program market.  And for years, our organization has been focused on expanding the pie, and they are continuing to do exactly that. And when we talk about expanding the pie, they are -- those employees at a no programmer mean -- they're wearing garments, right? It's -- but they are -- they may be buying it themselves. They may be buying it through a catalog, it might be a centralized program for the company, but they're purchasing them.  And then we provide more value to them with the products and services that we offer, whether they're unique products like Carhartt or Chef Works or Landau, great branded programs. But the no-program market is really attractive for us, and we find that market sees really good value in what we're offering. So we're focused on expanding that high, and that will continue. Yes. Great question, Stephanie. That's a very complicated answer because there's so many inputs to it. But it starts with being highly focused on taking incredibly good care of our customers and attracting and retaining the very best people. But then giving them product, services, tools so that they can not only have the intent to take great care of our customers, but do just exactly that.  So -- and that gets into great products that I mentioned earlier, the service -- focus that we -- or the tools that we're making that make it easier to do business with us. But it gets down to our people and positioning them to take a really, really good care of our customers and then executing on that. And they're executing at a really high level.  And we talk often about when markets -- when things are challenging, when it's hard to attract people, when it's hard to procure products, when it's hard to operate in the marketplace, it gives us a chance to shine. And our culture is shining through. And our people are doing one heck of a job in taking care of our customers. Scott, I'll start. Mike, if you would like to chime in there. We're deploying technology, and you can call it automation, you can call it technology, you can call it digital. We're deploying that across all of our businesses and across all areas of our business as well, and we've been focused on that for years.  But there certainly is -- we're seeing some real benefits there with our investment with SAP, with our investments -- our partnerships with Google and with Verizon. And it's -- those are -- we see that there's plenty of opportunities still to come there to improve in the efficiencies of our business and to automate certain functions.  And we call it -- make it easier for our customers to do business and make it easier for our employee partners to take great care of our customers. The more we can invest there, we think it's an incredibly good use of our balance sheet because it positions us well for not just the short term, but the long term as well. Scott, to expand upon what Mike said, it is a journey. But when you're on that journey, there is benefits -- a long, long tail of benefits as well. And so we will continue to invest appropriately. We have relationships at a very high level in each of those organizations, and it's going to bear fruit for us. And that's part of our plan.  It's not easy. It's very challenging to go through these processes. But our team has shown the wherewithal to not only digest the change, but then leverage the opportunities that are in front of them. Good question, Shlomo. Yes. Again, we love the First Aid business. But we're -- there's so many inputs to margin expansion, and we're leveraging them all. It starts with really good revenue growth, and we're seeing that. And that's in a big way because the value proposition is resonating, the products, the services that we offer in the marketplace, trying to attract and retain people is still challenging.  And people are trying to -- customers are trying to take really good care of their people. And we're benefiting from that and we're helping them accomplish exactly that. We're helping them run their business better. So that's helpful. The mix, as you know, has -- back during the pandemic, it was certainly so much more focused on safety products, a lot of clubs and a lot of sanitizer and those types of items.  And that has abated a bit, and the mix is back focused on First Aid and those types of products, more recurring revenue type. And yes, we are absolutely leveraging technology to make it easier to do business, but also to position our partners, our employee partners to provide more value to our customers.  And SmartTruck is a component of that. We did have a little bit of energy tailwind, 40 basis points. But as Mike cited earlier, not all that's because of the price at the pump. That is also because we are extracting the inefficiencies out. And we always talk around here about how we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop.  That's better for our customers, that's better for our employee partners. And all that is contributing. And then lastly, as I mentioned, our supply chain team has done a great job. They are leveraging the opportunities there. The larger we get in that business, the more leverage they have, and they're executing at a high level.  And -- so many inputs that are contributing to it, and -- but the -- what's really encouraging is, we see those having an opportunity to continue in the future. So certainly, no event is more of a process. Yes. Pardon me. So from a labor standpoint, yes. As I mentioned earlier, it is easier, but not easy. And we are looking for great people. We want to hire not only people that are employed somewhere else, but happily employed, which is very challenging. And -- but we think we have a great employee value proposition as well.  And so we're highly focused on that. So -- but yes, easier than it was a year ago. But Shlomo, throughout my career, it's always been challenging. It's a little bit more challenging than it has been historically, but not what it once was a year ago or so. Yes, Kartik. First of all, we're a really different company today than we were in 2008, 2009. We have a much more diversified customer base. We're now -- today 70% of our customers are service is providing, 30% are goods producing. We have significant verticals that we didn't have as well, health care, education, government.  So we think we're really well positioned for whenever the next recession is. And I remember '08, '09 because I was running the sales organization back then. And our value propositions still resonated with people, and we still sold new business. And we did so at attractive rates. As I mentioned, it's not always are we asking for new money. Sometimes it's just a redirection of those from somewhere else to us, not only in a -- maybe a direct competitor standpoint, but also they're purchasing clothing, they're purchasing items to take care of the facilities. So we think we're well positioned. I might also mention, you didn't ask specifically about it, but we love having a pristine balance sheet. And we think whenever the next recession is that might open up opportunities for us. And just the fact that we've -- our organization is focused on fighting through whatever the economic environment is, taking great care of our customers, taking great care of our employee partners.  And we've grown sales in 52 of the last 54 years. And we suspect that whatever the economic environment is, we believe we're going to be successful in it. Yes, Kartik, it's a good question. I don't have that in front of me, but I know it's -- it has returned much closer to historical or even higher as far as what we see from a repeat -- recurring type of revenue. And we want to provide value to the customers, whatever product services they want. It's just the nature of it, what we provide, whether it be First Aid supplies, access to AEDs, access to eyewash stations, access to clean water through our WaterBreak offering.  Those are all items that are really important to our customers more so today than they were pre-pandemic, and we think that, that trend will continue. Yes. Great question, Toni. I'm glad you asked because my first job 34 years ago was on the trucks. And we have been cross-selling our products via our -- we call them our service sales representatives. We've been cross-selling them since I started, and I'm sure it was in place well before I started as well. So we see -- the fact that we have 12,000 or so trucks that roll out of our parking lots every single day that are focused on taking great care of our customers, when they roll out of those parking lots, they're spending time in those businesses.  And they have eyes. They have ears, they have minds, and they see what's going on in those businesses, and they see opportunities. And it always has been and always will be a key component of our growth trajectory because we see that infrastructure as a real advantage. And we leverage it and make sure that those service providers, either they provide more products and services or they provide a lead to provide more products and services based upon the nature of the product that the customer might be interested in. Toni, we know that our customer satisfaction scores are really good. And in large part because they really like our people. They like our service providers, our frontline service providers. And we leverage that. And whether it be, as Mike mentioned, a more -- a smaller type customer, we can cross-sell via the service provider. A larger one that's a little bit more complicated.  There might be a need for some air cover, for some help there. But nevertheless, that's always been an important component of our strategy and always will be. Yes, Toni, great question. So we are always on the lookout for those opportunities. We think we have a really strong technology platform that we can build off of. But we know that the answer for what our customers are interested in is with spending time with our customers, and our employee partners are the ones who discern those opportunities.  So we're always asking now, how do we make it easier to do business, what -- is there any void? And frankly, that's where most of our investments have come from, that information, been trying to make it easier to do business with us. So we're always in search of trying to be a world-class service provider, but having an incredibly strong technology platform that makes it easier for our customers to do business with us, that makes it easier for our employee partners, our service providers to create a world-class experience for those customers. So yes, we're in search of whether it's -- we buy it or we bolt it on to our current platform or we created ourselves, all of those are of interest to us, and we'll be moving forward."

            "name": "Michael Hansen",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 first quarter revenue was $2.34 billion compared to $2.17 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 11%.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue was an all-time high of 48.7% for the first quarter of fiscal '24, compared to 47.5% last year, an increase of 120 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this record gross margin. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 50 basis points from last year.  Please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies we've created with our proprietary SmartTruck technology. Certainly, we've also seen a benefit from a drop in prices at the pump compared to a year ago. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 55.9% for First Aid and Safety Services, 49% for Fire Protection Services and 38.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $500.6 million compared to $440.1 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.4% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.3% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 19.2% compared to 14.8% last year.  The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the first quarter was $385.1 million compared to $351.7 million last year. This year's first quarter diluted EPS of $3.70 compared to $3.39 last year, an increase of 9.1%.  Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter grew 13% over the prior year. On September 15, we paid shareholders $138.3 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.8% from the amount paid the previous September. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt; our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23.  The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. Guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. Jared? Manav, I might just add -- Manav, I might just add to that, you asked about our pricing strategy. And as we've talked in the past, our goal is operating margin improvement, right? And pricing can be a lever within that, but we have other levers. It's not the only way for us to improve margins.  And so as we think about the operating margin strategy of increasing, we've got a lot of good things going on. And this is a great quarter that shows where pricing is sort of returning back to that historical level. We still increased margins quite nicely even to record levels. And again, it's just that pricing is a part of that strategy. Sure. We did see a little bit of an increase in CapEx in Q1. We are -- as we've talked, we are in the midst of implementing SAP for our Fire Protection business and that adds a little bit of CapEx. In the first quarter, we also saw -- over the last couple of years, supply chains, our vendors have had some disruption in their ability to deliver trucks being the best example.  And in the first quarter, we saw a little bit of a catch-up in terms of us receiving more of those trucks. And so we saw a bit of an increase there too in the first quarter. I expect for the year that we're going to likely be right around 4%. Longer term, we still believe 3.5% to 4%. But because of SAP and sort of that catch-up might be a little closer to 4% this year. George, I might just reiterate what I mentioned in the prepared remarks that keeping in mind that the energy benefit that we are getting is partly because we are working really hard at things like our SmartTruck initiative. So in other words, as we continue to grow really nicely with volumes, we don't need to add as many routes and trucks as we have in the past, and that creates then better fuel efficiency, if you will, throughout our network. And so that's a -- it is a proactive initiative to get energy down. And one of those proactive ways is through that SmartTruck technology. Nothing unusual in the quarter. We did see the -- we talked in the fourth quarter about some claims getting higher, but not structural. We saw those come back down to something more normal. But as it relates to the quarter, just some puts and takes, nothing of any significance. Our goal is to continue to leverage particularly the G&A piece of that, and we're going to continue to work at that. Seth, I might point out that the last 2 years have -- they have been a significant recapture of what we sort of lost in that pandemic period of time. In our fiscal '22, that business grew organically over 50%; in fiscal '23, it was almost 30%. So there was a lot of recapture going on, but keep in mind that our longer-term goal for that business, Todd expects it to grow, but it's probably more of a low single-digit to mid-single-digit grower in our portfolio. Yes. There are so many details that go into all of the things that Todd just talked about, that it's really hard to put a number on it. Our goal is, as you've heard us say, is continue to improve margins. We have a number of different levers to do so. Our goal is incrementals in that 20% to 30% range, recognizing we're at the bottom of that range today.  But it's hard to put a specific number on what's left because we're always working on what's -- what more can we do. And there are so many details and so many different projects we're working on. So our guide certainly does imply for continued margin improvement over last year, and that's the way we think about it. From a Fire perspective, the -- we are in the midst of the early innings of the implementation. And so we'll see some pressure in the Fire margins a little bit this year and a little bit next year. The synergies and the benefits don't come overnight. It's not a flip of the switch.  And so we -- just like we did with the Rental business and the First Aid business before that, we need to get onto the platform. It takes a little bit of time to get really good at using the platform, and then we really start to see the benefits accelerate just like we have in First Aid and Rental. Now that's a -- Fire is a smaller part of our business, but we certainly expect that those benefits will come.  As it relates to SAP, SAP is not -- it's a journey, right? And we are -- even though we are on SAP and will be for most of our business after the Fire Protection business gets on, there are constant things to learn from SAP. There are new initiatives in working with SAP and Google and Verizon that create new and different things. And so we look at this -- I think Todd's talked about it as one of his largest initiatives in terms of technology.  And it's a journey. It's not a flip of the switch. We turn on new systems here and there. So we're in the midst of that. We'll continue to invest in all of that. And our expectation is, it's going to continue to bring benefits into the future. Kartik, I might add, Todd might be a little modest. He was running that organization. It was a difficult environment, and he and the sales team exceeded their internal goals and really continued to show that value even in tough times, as Todd mentioned. And as he also talked about, our customer base is quite a bit broader than it was back then, and our sales team is a little bit different.  But the really good news is even back then, in the deepest, longest, broadest recession we'd seen in 100 years, we still sold a lot of new business. And it's a nice reflection of the value proposition that we have. And Toni, we've talked a lot about this over the last -- more than 10 years, we've got customers of all different sizes, verticals, et cetera. And so while we do certainly expect those service sales reps to continue to penetrate and sell, we recognize that some businesses are just more complex than others, are larger than others.  And so sometimes, there's a strategy to enhance that opportunity. And it might be through, for example, in health care. We have dedicated people that really do reach out to the decision makers. So it's not just the service sales rep, but it's also other people that have relationship responsibilities that are looking for those new and different penetration opportunities.  It's not as simple just to simply say we're going to go in and have a service sales rep or an SSR go into each customer and sell it, all customers are so different. And so we need a strategy that can attack all types of customers, and we do."
