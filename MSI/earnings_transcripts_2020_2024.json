If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations Web site. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of this call over the Internet. The Web site address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investors. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference.\nTim Yocum: Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2020 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of Products & Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President of Software & Services. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A. We\u2019ve posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we\u2019ll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during the presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today\u2019s earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I\u2019ll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results as well as our outlook. First, I'm very pleased with our performance during the quarter. We achieved revenue and earnings per share above our guidance, had our largest quarter ever for LMR orders in North America and we ended the year with record backlog of $11.4 billion, up $175 million versus last year and up $750 million sequentially. Additionally, we generated $703 million of operating cash flow during the quarter and 1.6 billion for the full year. Second, our software and services segment had another strong quarter as demand for our LMR services, video security and command center software continues to drive growth. For the full year the segment grew 9%, expanded operating margins by 290 basis points and accounted for 37% of total revenues and 52% of total operating earnings for the entire company. Additionally, the recurring nature of this segment and record ending backlog provides us with good visibility going forward and we expect another year of strong growth in this segment in 2021. Finally, we saw a number of events during the year that continue to reinforce the importance of having secure reliable mission critical communications for first responders. Whether it was the hurricanes in the southeast, fires in California or more recently, the explosion in Nashville, our LMR networks continued to provide private, secure voice communication to the men and women on the front lines when other networks were down. And while we continue to invest in broadband solutions that augment LMR with valuable data and location capabilities, the redundancy, resiliency, and reliability that LMR provides during the most critical moments continues to be foundational and a must have for our customers. I'll now turn the call back over to Jason to take through your results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Our Q4 results included revenue of $2.3 billion, down 4% including $60 million from acquisitions and $19 million from favorable currency rates. GAAP operating earnings of $555 million and operating margins of 24.4% compared to 24.8% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $667 million, down $40 million or 6% and non-GAAP operating margins of 29.3%, down from 29.7%, due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. GAAP earnings per share of $2.37 compared to $1.39 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a noncash charge of $1.53 booked in Q4 of 2019 related to the actions taken then to derisk our pension. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.86 versus $2.94 last year, down primarily due to lower sales from Products and SI, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. OpEx in Q4 was $492 million, down $31 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary spend, lower incentives and then partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q4 effective tax rate was 21% compared to 22% in the prior year. Moving to the full year 2020. Our revenue was $7.4 billion, down 6% primarily related to lower sales of public safety LMR and PCR products, partially offset by growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenues from acquisitions was $203 million and currency headwinds were $12 million. GAAP operating earnings were $1.4 billion or 18.7% of sales versus 20% in the year prior. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales from Products and SSI, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. Non-GAAP operating earnings grew $1.8 billion, down $140 million and non-GAAP operating margins were 24.8% of sales, a decrease of only 20 bps despite the sales declines in Products and SI, driven by the actions we implemented around costs, lower incentives and growth in Software and Services. GAAP earnings per share was $5.45 compared to $4.95 in the prior year, which included the previously mentioned noncash charge for pension. Non-GAAP EPS was $7.69, down 3% from $7.96 in 2019 on lower sales and operating earnings, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in 2020. For the full year, OpEx was $1.8 billion, down $162 million from last year, primarily driven by lower incentives, lower discretionary spend and offset by $75 million from acquisitions. And the effective tax rate for 2020 was 20% compared to 22.4% in the prior year on higher R&D tax credits and higher tax benefits from share based compensation recognized in the current year. Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $703 million compared with $795 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $637 million compared with $736 million in the prior year. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.6 billion compared to $1.8 billion in the prior year and free cash flow was $1.4 billion versus $1.6 billion in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was driven by lower sales and higher cash taxes in the current year, partially offset by improvements in working capital. Capital allocation in 2020 for us included $612 million of share repurchases at an average price of 155 and $0.93 per share, $436 million in cash dividends and $287 million for acquisitions. Additionally, during the year, we refinanced outstanding debt maturities with a new $900 million 10 year debt issuance at a rate of 2.3% and raised our dividend 11%. Moving to our segment results. Q4 products and system integration sales were $1.5 billion, down 10% primarily due to lower sales of public safety LMR and lower sales of professional and commercial radio partially offset by growth in video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $44 million. Operating earnings were $408 million or 27% of sales, down from 28.9% in the prior year on lower sales. Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include $122 million P25 order for Nassau County, New York, a $61 million P25 order for state of New Jersey, over 50 million of P25 orders from several large North America utilities customers, a $26 million P25 order from Morris County, New Jersey, and a $20 million tetra order in the UK. Additionally, we had another quarter of double digit growth in fixed video sales into our government customers. For the full year, revenue in the segment was $4.6 billion, down 13% in the prior year, driven by lower sales of public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security. Revenue from acquisitions was $119 million. Operating earnings were $880 million or 19% of sales, down from 22% in the prior year on lower sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Moving next to our Software and Services segment. Q4 revenue was $763 million, up 8% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $16 million. Operating earnings were $259 million or 33.9% of sales, up 220 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q4 wins in this segment include a $100 million P25 managed services contract with the State of Tasmania, Australia, a $79 million tetra managed services contract extension in Europe, a $30 million P25 multiyear service contract with the Minnesota DOT, a $29 million P25 multiyear service contract with Austin, Texas, and finally an $11 million award for a command center software contract in Norway. For the full year, revenue was $2.8 billion, up 9% on growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions was$84 million. Operating earnings in 2020 were $955 million or 34.3% of sales, up 290 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Looking next at our regional results. North America Q4 revenue was $1.6 billion, down 4% on declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. For the full year, North America revenue was $5.2 billion, down 5% with declines in public safety, LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. International Q4 revenue was $725 million, down 6% due to declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security and LMR services. Revenues declined in Latin America and Asia-Pac while EMEA was up 2%. And for the full year, international revenue was $2.4 billion, down 8% on declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security, command center software and LMR services. Revenue declined for the year in Latin America and Asia pack while EMEA was flat year-over-year. Moving to backlog. Our ending backlog was a record $11.4 billion, up $175 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $753 million, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter. Software and Services backlog was up $213 million compared to last year, driven by multiyear agreements in North America, partially offset by revenue recognition for airways. Sequentially, backlog was up $518 million with growth in both regions. Products and SI backlog was down $38 million compared to last year, driven by delays in sales engagements during the year related to COVID-19. Sequentially, backlog was up $236 million in Products and SI, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter. Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up between 5.5% and 6% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.58 and $1.64. This assumes FX at current spot rates, a share count of approximately $174 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 19%. And for the full year, we expect sales to be up between 7.25% and 8% with mid single digit growth in Products and SI and low double digit growth in Software and Services. And we expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.50 and $8.62 per share. This assumes FX at current spot rates and a share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%. We expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion, which includes an unfavorable year-over-year impact of approximately $125 million related to higher cash taxes. And we expect full year OpEx to be approximately $1.9 billion, which includes a year over year increase of $75 million related to higher incentives as we plan for growth and $60 million related to acquisitions closed in 2020 offset by further cost reductions. Finally, I'd like to highlight that we are updating our reporting to incorporate an enhanced disclosure around our three major technologies across both segments. As a result in our forthcoming 10-K, you will see net sales in our two segments reported in the following three technologies, LMR mission critical communications, video security and analytics, and command center software. We have provided a supplemental slide in the back of our earnings presentation, representing this view for the previous three years and on an ongoing basis, we will incorporate this into our quarterly reporting. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Jason. And I thought I would end with a few thoughts on the business. First, I want to take a minute to talk about the substantial progress we're making in video security. Three years ago, we began our investment in video security with our acquisition of Avigilon. Since that time, we've added acquisitions that leverage our scale across our portfolio in AI powered analytics, NBAA compliant manufacturing, and go to market coverage. As a result, we expect to generate over a billion dollars in annual revenue this year across our portfolio of video security technologies. This includes our fixed end to end video security and access control solutions embedded with advanced analytics and mobile video, which includes purpose built body worn and in car video solutions that are integrated with back end evidence management software. Additionally, this quarter we began shipping cameras from our new global NBAA compliant video manufacturing facility in Richardson, Texas. In fixed video, we launched Avigilon cloud services last year to connect customers to cloud based analytics, system management and continuous updates. As customers embrace analytics to convert video into data and the scalability of the cloud or run their operations, we expect this to be a growth driver for the business. And in mobile video this quarter, we'll begin deploying customers on command central evidence, which is our next generation digital evidence management platform and a fully integrated component of our premier one cloud suite that includes CAD, mobile and records solutions available on the secure Azure Government cloud. Currently, we have thousands of customers using either our digital evidence management system or command center software, and we believe the intersection of our install base and mobile video in the command center positions us well for continued growth. Second, the investments we're making to integrate Video Security, Command Center software and LMR continue. This past summer, we launched Safety Reimagined, focusing the integration of our products into one unified ecosystem, helping our customers be more efficient and proactive in their security and safety operations. We're redefining the ease with which our AI enabled solutions adapt to the needs of our customers by removing systems silos, simplifying management and automating workflows for the effective detection, analysis, communication and response to incidents. Imagine a scenario where an unusual activity is detected by our Avigilon camera, all security guards with Motorola radios in the vicinity are notified and the case is automatically and seamlessly open in the Incident Management System. Simultaneously, live video streams from the relevant cameras are automatically pumped into the Avigilon control center, and an operator is able to verify the presence of a suspicious package by leveraging our appearance search feature. This intuitive, easily customizable interaction between technologies is enabled by our new cloud based business workflow automation software, Orchestra, which we launched just this past week. Finally, as we close out literally a year like no other, I want to take a moment to reflect on everything we accomplished as a company. When COVID-19 hit, we moved swiftly and with focus to make a number of immediate decisions, including implementing a work from home policy to ensure the safety of our employees and reducing operating expenses, quickly culminating in $162 million OpEx reduction year-over-year inclusive of acquisitions. And yet we remain focused on executing in a challenging environment, with Software and Services growing every quarter and Products and SI improving in the second half as we expected. We also continue to deploy capital and invest for the future. We launched several new products, accelerated product migration to the cloud across our three technologies, acquired five companies, refinanced approximately $900 million of debt at very attractive low rates, repurchased 612 million of shares as well. And additionally, with Gino's retirement, we elevated Jason Winkler to the CFO position, a strong example of our readiness and succession planning. I am really proud of the way our team performed during an unprecedented year. All that we've accomplished and the improvement in our sales engagements demonstrate the enduring strength and durability of both our business and our people, ending the year with a record backlog position is a testament to those efforts, and that momentum helps position us well for a year of strong growth, revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim.\nTim Yocum: Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I\u2019d like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow to accommodate as many participants as possible [Operator Instructions]. Operator, would you please remind all callers on the line how to ask a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tim Long with Barclays.\nTimLong: Two, if I could. First, maybe Greg, could you just give us an update, obviously, we're in a weird time with COVID and whatnot. But kind of what you're hearing from customers in the public safety side on budgeting and overall health of the customer base? And if there's any impact that you would see one way or the other, if there was some federal stimulus for state and local? And then the second one, maybe for you or Jack. On the video side, can you just talk about two of the areas, one is on the government side. Government, it sounds like it's going well. How much more room is there for growth as you further penetrate there? And then secondly, what does it take to do a better job on the body cam side and how do you see that as an opportunity? Thanks.\nGregBrown: So kind of overall, contextually, I feel pretty good about the demand signals we see overall at this point for 2021. Now obviously, we're still in a pandemic. We're matching supply and demand, given some of the supply constraints that we're currently going through. So our guidance is informed by those components and we think our full year is a prudent view given where we are. But I think that I'm really pleased with Q4, in particular, a record quarter in North America, a record quarter specifically with LMR in North America and finishing the year with record backlog are all positive trends. Environmentally, we transitioned from one administration to another. I think that what we do rises to the top of the food chain despite Republican or Democratic presidential administrations. I think our federal business, and Jack could talk about it, in 2020 was solid overall. It was down slightly but it was also coming off two back to back record years. But I think that the Biden administration has opportunities for us. I think it's more likely than not that we'll see stimulus but we'll see. And I think that there's also an opportunity perhaps in the new administration for some bipartisan support for potentially an infrastructure bill, which I think foundationally would serve us well. In terms of state and local and video\u2026\nJackMolloy: So Tim, just to kind of decompose your two questions, number one, in terms of our fixed video government sales, we're really pleased with the progress. If you remember when we acquired Avigilon, it was essentially a nascent business and very strong growth. In fact, fixed video growth in 2020 was north of 45% so we like that. That feels good. We also acquired Pelco. And I think it's important to point out that Pelco gave us federal government contractual mechanisms with which to sell upon and we enjoyed that, those contracts in 2020. So we feel good about that but more importantly, where we're going moving forward in 2021. With respect to mobile video, actually, we had a very strong year. If you look at the second half of the year, both Q3 and Q4, orders for body cams were up for us over 60% in both respective quarters. Fundamentally, what we're hearing from our customer base is customers want an alternative. I think with our market reach, our go to market coverage, our channels, I think we've got a reach to start to get into suburban rural municipalities as well, which is where we're going to start seeing the next level of decisions. The other piece of it that we haven't talked much about was we acquired a company called Edesix through our Avigilon acquisition. We had two international wins of over $1 million last year. And again, we think we're well set for the international market. The last thing and I think that really ties it all together and Greg hit it on the script is we're obviously launching a new digital evidence management platform this year with CommandCentral Evidence. We've got a differentiator and that our body worn and how mobile video flows ties into our full workflow with CAD mobile records and are obviously digital evidence management. So we're excited. We think we're well poised for the body worn space as well.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.\nAdamTindle: Greg, I just wanted to start, on the last call, you called 2021 a growth year for both segments. I know you didn't specifically guide, but there's some perception that you are comfortable with street estimates. You have strong backlog. I think currency moved your direction but now today guiding below street estimates. So is this just a case where we were off in terms of the street, or is there anything that gives you maybe a little bit more conservatism now versus 90 days ago?\nGregBrown: As I mentioned 90 days ago, I did expect us to forecast growth in 2021 and that's what we're doing. I do feel, Adam, pretty good about the growth overall but also by segment and the respective technologies and the theaters. I think that we'll grow products in mid single digit. We expect to grow Software and Services in low double digit. The backlog position, as you referenced, serves us well. I think the fact of the matter is we're still early days in February and still in the middle of a pandemic. Things are incrementally getting better. And we're still operating at this point, Adam, with some supply constraints and limitations. Now the demand signals are stronger than the current supply constraints that we have. So that's also informing our guidance and we think given the overall environment, is probably a prudent thing to do at this point in time. We'll see how the rest of the year plays out.\nAdamTindle: And just as a follow-up, I wanted to maybe paint a narrative and have you respond to it. Right now, it seems like the body worn camera market is becoming increasingly important to the customer base. And wondering how this impacts the share of wallet opportunity within the customer base for follow on products? Because the investor concern is that you're known for LMR leadership, not necessarily known for body worn camera leadership. And as this becomes more important, perhaps it's a better opportunity for your competitor to upsell their software suite. So I think you kind of understand the narrative there. I'd just be curious, your comments on that and how you would potentially debunk that.\nGregBrown: No. I mean, look, I think the body-worn video area is a great opportunity. I think historically, it's been served by one provider. Now there's a more compelling viable choice as an alternative in Motorola Solutions. I think Jack referenced the strong order activity that he saw in Q3 and Q4. I think that serves us well. We also think the integration of body worn video and evidence management into the command center, given our incumbency and strong position across the different modules that broaden the whole suite and command center software, I like that position. And look, I also think we can grow internationally with body worn camera. And at the end of the day, the body worn video addressable market, we think, is about $500 million all in with body worn camera and evidence management. I think we have a great opportunity to take share and be a competitive compelling number two. But I also like the fixed video and access control addressable market being a multiple of that. Without China, we think it's about $15 billion. So there's a lot of room to run across the technologies, inclusive of body worn. But I think historically, that market has been served by one provider.\nJackMolloy: Yes. And the only other thing I'd add on that, Greg, we don't think it's one or the other. As we said before, they all need to have technologies. Do you need body cams for accountability? Yes, without a doubt. And we've seen our growth over 60% both Q3 and Q4. But if you look at our performance from an LMR perspective, it was big deals like Nassau and New Jersey. But quite frankly, Q4 from a grassroots perspective, which we track was our strongest Q4 in five years. And so we think there's certainly opportunities on both ends of the spectrum and we think wallets won't be constrained, wallets will open up for more technology.\nOperator: And the next question is from George Notter with Jefferies.\nGeorgeNotter: I guess I was curious about some of the comments on record backlog. Was there anything unusual about the order book this quarter? Was there an Airwave contract extension, for example, anything sizable in terms of the order book?\nJasonWinkler: So we saw strong orders across the board, North America we highlighted being a record. We talked about some rather large orders, Nassau County, some utilities summing to $50 million. But as Jack just mentioned, our grassroots, which is smaller deals, transactional type deals were also up significantly. So across the board type deal activity in North America, complemented also by international with renewal of managed services in EMEA and a new contract award for the State of Tasmania in Australia. So I'd say across the board in both theaters, strong orders performance.\nGeorgeNotter: And then just as a follow-up, you guys seem to be talking a lot more about LMR services. And I know managed services in general have been a push for the company, but just based on your commentary, it seems like there's a positive inflection there. Is that the right perception to have and can you talk more about what's intuitively driving that? Thanks a lot.\nKellyMark: On the Services, we've been pleased with the performance of Services. In particular, it demonstrates the resiliency of the recurring revenue business that we've built in Software and Services. In particular, as we look at 2020 and going into 2021, North America Services has been growing, so is international. We have expanded our service offering. We are now pushing a bit more into cybersecurity as well, which is a very, very attractive area that continues to be a focus amongst municipalities. But I think that the Services business, as we look at it, continues to operate at a steady pace. As Jason just highlighted, we had a number of good orders, managed service orders internationally that either extended existing networks that we had or also added on new ones like the Tasmania transaction that we just discussed. So the Services business continues to be something that demonstrates also the resiliency of LMR and the demand for that, because we see our customers continue to renew the contracts that they have at increased rates and on time, which is a very positive indicator of both the compelling nature of our services but also the importance of LMR.\nJasonWinkler: Also, the investments we're making on the product side of LMR to advance the networks continue to get more complex and connecting them the cloud with Cirrus will continue to provide opportunities to grow our managed services offer in and around those new products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.\nKeithHousum: I guess dissecting the larger orders that came in, in the fourth quarter, again. Perhaps you can provide a little more color if you can in terms of what's the primary driver that you're seeing from your customers? Is it really the large guys versus small guys? Is it new offerings that are allowing the contracts at a higher price? I guess, is there any two or three things that are primary drivers of those large orders now?\nJackMolloy: So a few things. As you can imagine, part of this was we had, I would say, our engagement with customers, particularly in Q2, was slightly impaired. So we saw obviously the velocity of those engagements improve in the second half. But the other thing that I think we're going to start to see, particularly as it relates to Nassau County, which was one of the big deals that we cited in our script, was a mix to the APX NEXT, which we announced in October of 2019. Is that obviously come at an ASP appreciation for us? It does. But I think more importantly, as you look throughout the portfolio, you look at what Kelly has brought to market in command center software. You look at what we're doing from a PCR perspective. Just this week, we announced a category changer in the ion device, which combines a legacy PCR device but also does private LTE and CBRS in one device. And so we think some of the investments we've made from an R&D perspective on device refresh, on converging devices and those experiences will continue to provide kind of an upgrade, upsell opportunity for our customers. We think more to follow into 2021.\nGregBrown: Yes. I mean, Keith, I agree. And at the end of the day, we said things would improve sequentially in the back half of 2020 as sales engagement improved. I think that was a driver. I think there has been pent up demand and exactly what Jack just said. Even during a COVID year, I can't remember this number of new products that we invested in, in 2020. Yes, we managed discretionary expenses down. Yes, we didn't have travel incentives. We had a benefit on expenses. But at the same time, whether it was APX NEXT, a new TETRA device, Ion for PCR, cloud enabled modules in command center, refreshing the video security suite, we made a conscious effort to invest organically in product development. And I think that strong Q4 in part is because of some of those new products. Our whole intent was not only to come out of COVID but come out stronger than we went in. And I think Kelly and Jack particularly have done a great job on prioritizing new products and investments.\nJackMolloy: And the thing we failed to mention just internationally as we start to see our momentum grow there is the MXP600, which was really the first major TETRA device announcement. And quite frankly, we were oversubscribed for that in Q4. We took as many orders we could ship. So we're happy with that too.\nKeithHousum: And just follow-up a question from earlier here. Cybersecurity, I know you guys have made several small acquisitions in that space. Can you provide a little bit more color about what the plan is for cybersecurity? Is it cybersecurity related to the networks or is it beyond that for public safety agencies? I guess, what's your goal?\nKellyMark: So the cybersecurity services that we offer right now and the ones that we also expanded last year with a couple of acquisitions will focus around monitoring, in incident resolution and helping our customers understand the risk profile of what they have installed both in their command center and in their LMR networks. So our initial focus is on those core areas that we provide our products around, specifically the LMR networks, as I said, in the command center. We'll look to expand to their critical networks that they may need to manage their operations. So it's pretty focused right now but something that our customers are very interested in because those are obviously the most critical assets that they need to protect and make sure they're always up and running.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Louie DiPalma with William Blair.\nLouieDiPalma: You formally launched the command center in the cloud, PremierOne platform in October. I was wondering, have adoption trends and performance lived up to your internal expectations? And as a follow up to that, is the pandemic stimulating the shift to your PremierOne platform from your on-premise customer base?\nKellyMark: On that question, the answer is yes. It's definitely stimulated, the interest in the cloud. I think everybody from consumers all the way to government have learned the importance of cloud and the ability to operate remotely. We accelerated our efforts to drive more and more of our command center to the cloud. You'll continue to see us expand more to the cloud even this year. It is one of the faster growing areas in our portfolio. We're getting a lot of interest in regards to conversations with our customers. As you know, those buying cycles are somewhat long so you'll hear more and more about that in the future. I would highlight, just as we talk about our command center growth, our SaaS revenue growth as a component of our command center, is growing at a multiple of our overall command center software growth. So that's a good indication that we're seeing more and more customers show interest and transition towards that type of model.\nLouieDiPalma: And related to what you just said, I know you have CAD, mobile and records on the PremierOne platform and you also spoke about SaaS. You previously indicated that you plan to offer 911 call taking in the cloud in the first half of 2021. Is that initiative still on track?\nKellyMark: That's correct and yes, it is. That is definitely another component, that's the final and the last component that we need to add to the cloud.\nOperator: And the next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen.\nPaulSilverstein: First off, before I ask my question, I just want to clarify. Jason, did I hear you say that PCR was $763 million for the year?\nJasonWinkler: PCR, no. But PCR was down about $300 million from last year. That was the decline that we saw in 2020.\nPaulSilverstein: So I'll make that my first question. So I think I remember you and Greg saying that you all were expecting about $350 million or 35% decline for the year. It sounds like it wasn't that much different but somewhat better. My question to you, my first question is, is that reflective of a stronger -- I assume it means you had a stronger Q4 than you're expecting. And the real question is looking forward, what is your expectations for the pace of recovery, given how hard 65% of the revenue in PCR was hit? Are you seeing that actually come back faster than you expected? What's your expectation for the year?\nGregBrown: So Paul, you're right. Q4 was better than we anticipated in PCR. So for the full year, as Jason just mentioned, it was down about $300 million. We had signaled it could be about $350 million, so a slight improvement. We do think it will continue to improve in 2021. And in fact, at this point, overall, I think our expectation is that it can grow. Now it will be incrementally as a number of different key verticals like transportation, airline, hospitality, oil and gas as they improve. But 2020 was pretty draconian. I look at it as more or less a floor, and our expectation is for PCR to return to growth in 2021. Now having said that, we still have to operate and execute on that against the supply constraints and limitations that are in front of us. But as we've started out the year in 2021, it's a good start.\nPaulSilverstein: My second question is looking at video and your command center software, and I appreciate you all giving the breakout. I think that's great. My question here is, in video, if I look at the numbers correctly, you put up -- it almost double in calendar '19, another almost 30% growth in calendar '20. Obviously, that was helped by the many acquisitions you've made. And then in command center software, you had about 30% year-over-year growth in calendar '19, albeit less than 10% growth in calendar '20, I assume, impacted by the pandemic. In those two particular product markets that represent a significantly greater growth opportunity for you, are you seeing a step-up in organic growth? If we look beyond the pandemic in terms of the trends, especially on the software side of video but taking the two together, are you seeing a step-up in organic growth?\nJasonWinkler: So within the technologies you're referring to, the growth expectations for video security are to be up high teens this year and command center software to return to 20% growth like measures which you mentioned on some of the lookback into 2019 and 2018 as we get beyond the pandemic impact, and that LMR would be up mid single digits. Those are the expectations for '21 from a technology standpoint.\nOperator: The next question is from Fahad Najam with MKM Partners.\nFahadNajam: If you could help me understand in terms of -- I understand it's a difficult question to answer. But can you give us a rough idea on the average life of the devices in the field? I suspect you have a new product that you launched last year or year before. So maybe you can give us some indication as to when we can expect to see some meaningful upside from a device refresh perspective.\nJackMolloy: So we've seen -- historically, five, six, seven years ago, people would hold the device for 10 years. The refresh cycle now looks more like six to seven years for a device.\nFahadNajam: And can you give us some indication as to where the average life of the devices are in the field today and how the adoption of the new APX NEXT device is going? And should we expect meaningful pressure on an upgrade cycle maybe in the near term or within the next 12 months?\nJackMolloy: So obviously, within the US and globally, there's so many municipalities, law enforcement. But the one thing that I would say is that we've looked over history, the XTS family, the APX family, we typically get three to five years until the revenue becomes very meaningful, and so we're 2.5 years in. We feel like we've got a great amount of refresh cycle, both with the APX NEXT and then internationally with their MXP600 device.\nKellyMark: And I'd add, in our product cycles, we run concurrent devices, both the old and the new so that we continue to sell both. It's not a consumer like where you switch from one to the other. So customers expect the device to be available for some time. And then, of course, the new device as it becomes more feature-rich and compelling, leads to a transition point.\nOperator: The next question will be from Sami Badri with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nSamiBadri: So I kind of just wanted to cover something that I don't think has been touched on, on this conference call or in the prepared remarks. It's referring to the Hytera litigation. We didn't get an update in January of 2021. I was hoping if we could just kind of go through the latest that you guys have heard from the ongoing litigation and whether or not the actual 2021 guidance includes any contribution or award contribution from that litigation outcome.\nJasonWinkler: So Sami, the guidance for full year 2021 does not contemplate any award or anticipated monetary settlement. What I would say is our engagement and pursuit legally of Hytera is unwavering and relentless. The court recently kind of recalculated the compensatory and punitive judgment to a number, I think it's $544 million, is the recalculated federal court award, but it doesn't change the fact that Hytera stole. They sold trade secrets. They infringed and they infringed on copyright source code. So that's unchanged. And having said that, we expect the current damages award again, I think it's $544 million, we expect that to increase after a court applies a pre and post trial interest as well as a compulsory royalty going forward. So stay tuned. We continue to pursue. It will remain front and center, nothing more important than protecting our intellectual property. But none of what I described is reflective of the numbers we talked about today.\nSamiBadri: And then the other thing I want to talk about more of a Motorola strategic perspective, is on prior calls, we've talked about you going after acquisitions and targets. I'm sorry if it was mentioned earlier on this call, and I'm essentially just repeating questions already asked. But what is the appetite of Motorola to go out and do same number of deals in 2021 comparable to 2020? Is there appetite for that right now or are you guys in digestion mode?\nGregBrown: I think there's appetite and there's capacity. But if you take a step back, my priority is investing organically in the business. We have great markets. The technologies of land mobile radio, mission critical communications, all the trends around modernizing 911 and command center software and of course, all things video, fixed video and access control, as well as body worn, but these are big addressable markets, in combination approaching $40 billion of an addressable market, that's probably 3x greater than it was for this company five years ago or so. So prioritizing new products, and investments, by the way, an investment like the global manufacturing facility for fixed video in Richardson, Texas, to give us better scale, better capacity, lower unit cost. Jack talked about APX NEXT. He talked about TETRA. He talked about PCR. You know we're investing in the cloud. And by the way, we also bought back stock at attractive rates. We look at the long range plan. We do the DCF. We look at where we think this stock is attractive to buy back and we've been active on that front as well. $612 million of share repurchase last year, $289 million of acquisitions. And we did another double digit raise on dividend of 11% of $436 million. So yes, we continue to scan acquisition opportunities. There will probably be more around video security, software and services. But I think we've been good stewards of capital. We'll continue to be responsible on that front. But we like the prospects both organically and inorganically.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question will come from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.\nBenBollin: Can we start looking at this Ion device specifically, how incremental is that product relative to what's been out there historically? It looks to be higher-priced versus the previous high end turbo product. So I'm interested in the spread there. And then I'm also curious, any thoughts you have on -- does this product open up new addressable market, because it's got more features and multimode and capabilities? So does it have more use cases and it opens up some TAM? What's your perspective on that product and that line as it expands?\nJackMolloy: Ben, we invested in the Ion because we believe we had an opportunity to create a new category. So some of the things that it does, obviously, when we make an engineering decision to include higher throughput mechanisms like private LTE, CBRS, we want to do though because we have an eye on a workflow that a customer application. So as an example, it does image capture. It does scanning. It does things that no radio that we've ever made for the PCR space has ever done. So fundamentally, that creates new opportunities. Think of things like warehousing, manufacturing, even there's hospitality, stadium security type applications. We also think, as Greg referred to Safety Reimagine, as we start to see our video opportunities, access control, merge with PCR opportunities, we think that kind of device plays well into that environment too. So again, it would be accretive to what we typically do. It redefines the PCR category.\nBenBollin: And my second question, just stepping back, Greg, when I look across the portfolio, you're really the only vendor who touches radio surveillance, command center with the breadth and the scope. Could you talk a little bit about the feedback from customers as you leverage that portfolio and just your long term aspiration to gain share in some of the markets where you're not as incumbent?\nGregBrown: Well, first of all, you're right. I don't think anybody else has the width and breadth of our portfolio. But our goal is to be the best and compelling across all three technologies. I mentioned the size of the addressable market. But I also think, and I referenced this a little bit in the opening remarks, I also think the special sauce is the integration of these technologies. Not only does not no one else have them but I think you're going to see us integrate them as well. Automated workflow, machine learning, AI powered analytics that allow -- I mean, there's volumes of video. And how do you see it, how do you watch it, how do you extract it, how do you redact it, how do you push it, to an incident to a dispatcher? And we're working not just having best in class point products for these technologies, and I like the hand of cards we're playing, but it's the orchestration and the integration led by our Chief Technology Officer, Mahesh Saptharishi, who's making great progress on the orchestration and integration. So you think about the things that are going on, whether it's social unrest, wildfires, immigration, there's a lot of trends, socially and environmentally that I think are favorable. There's a lot of technology trends that I think are favorable. And as we've talked about consistently about the overarching purpose of our company, of helping people be their best in the moments, those critical, mission-critical, literally moments that matter, that's the envelope of our vision and the technologies that we invest and the integration that we're pursuing. And I think there's more room to run, to your point, outside of the United States in a number of international theaters and stay tuned for us to share some more things on that front as well.\nOperator: Next question is from Jim Suva with Citi.\nJimSuva: Congratulations, and it's very encouraging, the backlog bookings outlook. Am I correct to say that, that does not include any potential government stimulus packages? Because it seems like whenever I read the online or watch the news, they're talking about stimulus packages, and maybe some of that comes to you or maybe it doesn't come to you. Or how should we think about -- are there anything potentially being talked about in stimulus that could actually take that number higher, or does it simply not filter into you guys? I'm just kind of curious about if anything there.\nGregBrown: Yes, Jim, I would say, remember, I mean, I think that engagements improved, new products getting traction, pent up demand, and we did have some benefit of CARES Act money, about $150 million in 2020 but also CARES funding is now extended through December of 2021. So there's a good level of continuity there. But you're right. I don't think as we describe the business and look at the visibility in terms of current demand signals, potential stimulus, potential infrastructure builds and things from Washington probably would be further enabling in some of the growth that we're expecting.\nJasonWinkler: The only other thing, Jim, that I'd piggyback on to what Greg said is that, obviously, the education space appears to be a place that there's going to be funding directed at and prioritized. What's really lost in the shuffle and lost in the noise is, I think, a pretty solid print in Q4 was what we've done with connected learning with our CBRS investment. We did close to $10 million in 2020 with some pretty major cities that those projects are a little bit like a snowball. They'll continue to grow. We\u2019ll also pull through video opportunities and access control opportunities. So we think there could be some potential that in the education space as well.\nJimSuva: That's what I thought. And thank you and congratulations to your team for a strong 2020 and outlook for '21.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.\nTim Yocum: No further comments. Thanks for joining us today.\nOperator: And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the Internet in approximately three hours. The Web site address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor.

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Our Q4 results included revenue of $2.3 billion, down 4% including $60 million from acquisitions and $19 million from favorable currency rates. GAAP operating earnings of $555 million and operating margins of 24.4% compared to 24.8% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $667 million, down $40 million or 6% and non-GAAP operating margins of 29.3%, down from 29.7%, due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. GAAP earnings per share of $2.37 compared to $1.39 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a noncash charge of $1.53 booked in Q4 of 2019 related to the actions taken then to derisk our pension. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.86 versus $2.94 last year, down primarily due to lower sales from Products and SI, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. OpEx in Q4 was $492 million, down $31 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary spend, lower incentives and then partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q4 effective tax rate was 21% compared to 22% in the prior year. Moving to the full year 2020. Our revenue was $7.4 billion, down 6% primarily related to lower sales of public safety LMR and PCR products, partially offset by growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenues from acquisitions was $203 million and currency headwinds were $12 million. GAAP operating earnings were $1.4 billion or 18.7% of sales versus 20% in the year prior. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales from Products and SSI, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. Non-GAAP operating earnings grew $1.8 billion, down $140 million and non-GAAP operating margins were 24.8% of sales, a decrease of only 20 bps despite the sales declines in Products and SI, driven by the actions we implemented around costs, lower incentives and growth in Software and Services. GAAP earnings per share was $5.45 compared to $4.95 in the prior year, which included the previously mentioned noncash charge for pension. Non-GAAP EPS was $7.69, down 3% from $7.96 in 2019 on lower sales and operating earnings, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count in 2020. For the full year, OpEx was $1.8 billion, down $162 million from last year, primarily driven by lower incentives, lower discretionary spend and offset by $75 million from acquisitions. And the effective tax rate for 2020 was 20% compared to 22.4% in the prior year on higher R&D tax credits and higher tax benefits from share based compensation recognized in the current year. Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $703 million compared with $795 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was $637 million compared with $736 million in the prior year. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.6 billion compared to $1.8 billion in the prior year and free cash flow was $1.4 billion versus $1.6 billion in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was driven by lower sales and higher cash taxes in the current year, partially offset by improvements in working capital. Capital allocation in 2020 for us included $612 million of share repurchases at an average price of 155 and $0.93 per share, $436 million in cash dividends and $287 million for acquisitions. Additionally, during the year, we refinanced outstanding debt maturities with a new $900 million 10 year debt issuance at a rate of 2.3% and raised our dividend 11%. Moving to our segment results. Q4 products and system integration sales were $1.5 billion, down 10% primarily due to lower sales of public safety LMR and lower sales of professional and commercial radio partially offset by growth in video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $44 million. Operating earnings were $408 million or 27% of sales, down from 28.9% in the prior year on lower sales. Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include $122 million P25 order for Nassau County, New York, a $61 million P25 order for state of New Jersey, over 50 million of P25 orders from several large North America utilities customers, a $26 million P25 order from Morris County, New Jersey, and a $20 million tetra order in the UK. Additionally, we had another quarter of double digit growth in fixed video sales into our government customers. For the full year, revenue in the segment was $4.6 billion, down 13% in the prior year, driven by lower sales of public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security. Revenue from acquisitions was $119 million. Operating earnings were $880 million or 19% of sales, down from 22% in the prior year on lower sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Moving next to our Software and Services segment. Q4 revenue was $763 million, up 8% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $16 million. Operating earnings were $259 million or 33.9% of sales, up 220 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q4 wins in this segment include a $100 million P25 managed services contract with the State of Tasmania, Australia, a $79 million tetra managed services contract extension in Europe, a $30 million P25 multiyear service contract with the Minnesota DOT, a $29 million P25 multiyear service contract with Austin, Texas, and finally an $11 million award for a command center software contract in Norway. For the full year, revenue was $2.8 billion, up 9% on growth in LMR services, growth in video security and growth in command center software. Revenue from acquisitions was$84 million. Operating earnings in 2020 were $955 million or 34.3% of sales, up 290 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Looking next at our regional results. North America Q4 revenue was $1.6 billion, down 4% on declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. For the full year, North America revenue was $5.2 billion, down 5% with declines in public safety, LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. International Q4 revenue was $725 million, down 6% due to declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security and LMR services. Revenues declined in Latin America and Asia-Pac while EMEA was up 2%. And for the full year, international revenue was $2.4 billion, down 8% on declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in video security, command center software and LMR services. Revenue declined for the year in Latin America and Asia pack while EMEA was flat year-over-year. Moving to backlog. Our ending backlog was a record $11.4 billion, up $175 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $753 million, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter. Software and Services backlog was up $213 million compared to last year, driven by multiyear agreements in North America, partially offset by revenue recognition for airways. Sequentially, backlog was up $518 million with growth in both regions. Products and SI backlog was down $38 million compared to last year, driven by delays in sales engagements during the year related to COVID-19. Sequentially, backlog was up $236 million in Products and SI, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter. Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up between 5.5% and 6% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.58 and $1.64. This assumes FX at current spot rates, a share count of approximately $174 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 19%. And for the full year, we expect sales to be up between 7.25% and 8% with mid single digit growth in Products and SI and low double digit growth in Software and Services. And we expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.50 and $8.62 per share. This assumes FX at current spot rates and a share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%. We expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion, which includes an unfavorable year-over-year impact of approximately $125 million related to higher cash taxes. And we expect full year OpEx to be approximately $1.9 billion, which includes a year over year increase of $75 million related to higher incentives as we plan for growth and $60 million related to acquisitions closed in 2020 offset by further cost reductions. Finally, I'd like to highlight that we are updating our reporting to incorporate an enhanced disclosure around our three major technologies across both segments. As a result in our forthcoming 10-K, you will see net sales in our two segments reported in the following three technologies, LMR mission critical communications, video security and analytics, and command center software. We have provided a supplemental slide in the back of our earnings presentation, representing this view for the previous three years and on an ongoing basis, we will incorporate this into our quarterly reporting. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. So we saw strong orders across the board, North America we highlighted being a record. We talked about some rather large orders, Nassau County, some utilities summing to $50 million. But as Jack just mentioned, our grassroots, which is smaller deals, transactional type deals were also up significantly. So across the board type deal activity in North America, complemented also by international with renewal of managed services in EMEA and a new contract award for the State of Tasmania in Australia. So I'd say across the board in both theaters, strong orders performance. Also, the investments we're making on the product side of LMR to advance the networks continue to get more complex and connecting them the cloud with Cirrus will continue to provide opportunities to grow our managed services offer in and around those new products. PCR, no. But PCR was down about $300 million from last year. That was the decline that we saw in 2020. So within the technologies you're referring to, the growth expectations for video security are to be up high teens this year and command center software to return to 20% growth like measures which you mentioned on some of the lookback into 2019 and 2018 as we get beyond the pandemic impact, and that LMR would be up mid single digits. Those are the expectations for '21 from a technology standpoint. So Sami, the guidance for full year 2021 does not contemplate any award or anticipated monetary settlement. What I would say is our engagement and pursuit legally of Hytera is unwavering and relentless. The court recently kind of recalculated the compensatory and punitive judgment to a number, I think it's $544 million, is the recalculated federal court award, but it doesn't change the fact that Hytera stole. They sold trade secrets. They infringed and they infringed on copyright source code. So that's unchanged. And having said that, we expect the current damages award again, I think it's $544 million, we expect that to increase after a court applies a pre and post trial interest as well as a compulsory royalty going forward. So stay tuned. We continue to pursue. It will remain front and center, nothing more important than protecting our intellectual property. But none of what I described is reflective of the numbers we talked about today. The only other thing, Jim, that I'd piggyback on to what Greg said is that, obviously, the education space appears to be a place that there's going to be funding directed at and prioritized. What's really lost in the shuffle and lost in the noise is, I think, a pretty solid print in Q4 was what we've done with connected learning with our CBRS investment. We did close to $10 million in 2020 with some pretty major cities that those projects are a little bit like a snowball. They'll continue to grow. We'll also pull through video opportunities and access control opportunities. So we think there could be some potential that in the education space as well."

            "name": "KellyMark",
            "content": "On the Services, we've been pleased with the performance of Services. In particular, it demonstrates the resiliency of the recurring revenue business that we've built in Software and Services. In particular, as we look at 2020 and going into 2021, North America Services has been growing, so is international. We have expanded our service offering. We are now pushing a bit more into cybersecurity as well, which is a very, very attractive area that continues to be a focus amongst municipalities. But I think that the Services business, as we look at it, continues to operate at a steady pace. As Jason just highlighted, we had a number of good orders, managed service orders internationally that either extended existing networks that we had or also added on new ones like the Tasmania transaction that we just discussed. So the Services business continues to be something that demonstrates also the resiliency of LMR and the demand for that, because we see our customers continue to renew the contracts that they have at increased rates and on time, which is a very positive indicator of both the compelling nature of our services but also the importance of LMR. So the cybersecurity services that we offer right now and the ones that we also expanded last year with a couple of acquisitions will focus around monitoring, in incident resolution and helping our customers understand the risk profile of what they have installed both in their command center and in their LMR networks. So our initial focus is on those core areas that we provide our products around, specifically the LMR networks, as I said, in the command center. We'll look to expand to their critical networks that they may need to manage their operations. So it's pretty focused right now but something that our customers are very interested in because those are obviously the most critical assets that they need to protect and make sure they're always up and running. On that question, the answer is yes. It's definitely stimulated, the interest in the cloud. I think everybody from consumers all the way to government have learned the importance of cloud and the ability to operate remotely. We accelerated our efforts to drive more and more of our command center to the cloud. You'll continue to see us expand more to the cloud even this year. It is one of the faster growing areas in our portfolio. We're getting a lot of interest in regards to conversations with our customers. As you know, those buying cycles are somewhat long so you'll hear more and more about that in the future. I would highlight, just as we talk about our command center growth, our SaaS revenue growth as a component of our command center, is growing at a multiple of our overall command center software growth. So that's a good indication that we're seeing more and more customers show interest and transition towards that type of model. That's correct and yes, it is. That is definitely another component, that's the final and the last component that we need to add to the cloud. And I'd add, in our product cycles, we run concurrent devices, both the old and the new so that we continue to sell both. It's not a consumer like where you switch from one to the other. So customers expect the device to be available for some time. And then, of course, the new device as it becomes more feature-rich and compelling, leads to a transition point."

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results as well as our outlook. First, I'm very pleased with our performance during the quarter. We achieved revenue and earnings per share above our guidance, had our largest quarter ever for LMR orders in North America and we ended the year with record backlog of $11.4 billion, up $175 million versus last year and up $750 million sequentially. Additionally, we generated $703 million of operating cash flow during the quarter and 1.6 billion for the full year. Second, our software and services segment had another strong quarter as demand for our LMR services, video security and command center software continues to drive growth. For the full year the segment grew 9%, expanded operating margins by 290 basis points and accounted for 37% of total revenues and 52% of total operating earnings for the entire company. Additionally, the recurring nature of this segment and record ending backlog provides us with good visibility going forward and we expect another year of strong growth in this segment in 2021. Finally, we saw a number of events during the year that continue to reinforce the importance of having secure reliable mission critical communications for first responders. Whether it was the hurricanes in the southeast, fires in California or more recently, the explosion in Nashville, our LMR networks continued to provide private, secure voice communication to the men and women on the front lines when other networks were down. And while we continue to invest in broadband solutions that augment LMR with valuable data and location capabilities, the redundancy, resiliency, and reliability that LMR provides during the most critical moments continues to be foundational and a must have for our customers. I'll now turn the call back over to Jason to take through your results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thanks, Jason. And I thought I would end with a few thoughts on the business. First, I want to take a minute to talk about the substantial progress we're making in video security. Three years ago, we began our investment in video security with our acquisition of Avigilon. Since that time, we've added acquisitions that leverage our scale across our portfolio in AI powered analytics, NBAA compliant manufacturing, and go to market coverage. As a result, we expect to generate over a billion dollars in annual revenue this year across our portfolio of video security technologies. This includes our fixed end to end video security and access control solutions embedded with advanced analytics and mobile video, which includes purpose built body worn and in car video solutions that are integrated with back end evidence management software. Additionally, this quarter we began shipping cameras from our new global NBAA compliant video manufacturing facility in Richardson, Texas. In fixed video, we launched Avigilon cloud services last year to connect customers to cloud based analytics, system management and continuous updates. As customers embrace analytics to convert video into data and the scalability of the cloud or run their operations, we expect this to be a growth driver for the business. And in mobile video this quarter, we'll begin deploying customers on command central evidence, which is our next generation digital evidence management platform and a fully integrated component of our premier one cloud suite that includes CAD, mobile and records solutions available on the secure Azure Government cloud. Currently, we have thousands of customers using either our digital evidence management system or command center software, and we believe the intersection of our install base and mobile video in the command center positions us well for continued growth. Second, the investments we're making to integrate Video Security, Command Center software and LMR continue. This past summer, we launched Safety Reimagined, focusing the integration of our products into one unified ecosystem, helping our customers be more efficient and proactive in their security and safety operations. We're redefining the ease with which our AI enabled solutions adapt to the needs of our customers by removing systems silos, simplifying management and automating workflows for the effective detection, analysis, communication and response to incidents. Imagine a scenario where an unusual activity is detected by our Avigilon camera, all security guards with Motorola radios in the vicinity are notified and the case is automatically and seamlessly open in the Incident Management System. Simultaneously, live video streams from the relevant cameras are automatically pumped into the Avigilon control center, and an operator is able to verify the presence of a suspicious package by leveraging our appearance search feature. This intuitive, easily customizable interaction between technologies is enabled by our new cloud based business workflow automation software, Orchestra, which we launched just this past week. Finally, as we close out literally a year like no other, I want to take a moment to reflect on everything we accomplished as a company. When COVID-19 hit, we moved swiftly and with focus to make a number of immediate decisions, including implementing a work from home policy to ensure the safety of our employees and reducing operating expenses, quickly culminating in $162 million OpEx reduction year-over-year inclusive of acquisitions. And yet we remain focused on executing in a challenging environment, with Software and Services growing every quarter and Products and SI improving in the second half as we expected. We also continue to deploy capital and invest for the future. We launched several new products, accelerated product migration to the cloud across our three technologies, acquired five companies, refinanced approximately $900 million of debt at very attractive low rates, repurchased 612 million of shares as well. And additionally, with Gino's retirement, we elevated Jason Winkler to the CFO position, a strong example of our readiness and succession planning. I am really proud of the way our team performed during an unprecedented year. All that we've accomplished and the improvement in our sales engagements demonstrate the enduring strength and durability of both our business and our people, ending the year with a record backlog position is a testament to those efforts, and that momentum helps position us well for a year of strong growth, revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. So kind of overall, contextually, I feel pretty good about the demand signals we see overall at this point for 2021. Now obviously, we're still in a pandemic. We're matching supply and demand, given some of the supply constraints that we're currently going through. So our guidance is informed by those components and we think our full year is a prudent view given where we are. But I think that I'm really pleased with Q4, in particular, a record quarter in North America, a record quarter specifically with LMR in North America and finishing the year with record backlog are all positive trends. Environmentally, we transitioned from one administration to another. I think that what we do rises to the top of the food chain despite Republican or Democratic presidential administrations. I think our federal business, and Jack could talk about it, in 2020 was solid overall. It was down slightly but it was also coming off two back to back record years. But I think that the Biden administration has opportunities for us. I think it's more likely than not that we'll see stimulus but we'll see. And I think that there's also an opportunity perhaps in the new administration for some bipartisan support for potentially an infrastructure bill, which I think foundationally would serve us well. In terms of state and local and video... As I mentioned 90 days ago, I did expect us to forecast growth in 2021 and that's what we're doing. I do feel, Adam, pretty good about the growth overall but also by segment and the respective technologies and the theaters. I think that we'll grow products in mid single digit. We expect to grow Software and Services in low double digit. The backlog position, as you referenced, serves us well. I think the fact of the matter is we're still early days in February and still in the middle of a pandemic. Things are incrementally getting better. And we're still operating at this point, Adam, with some supply constraints and limitations. Now the demand signals are stronger than the current supply constraints that we have. So that's also informing our guidance and we think given the overall environment, is probably a prudent thing to do at this point in time. We'll see how the rest of the year plays out. No. I mean, look, I think the body-worn video area is a great opportunity. I think historically, it's been served by one provider. Now there's a more compelling viable choice as an alternative in Motorola Solutions. I think Jack referenced the strong order activity that he saw in Q3 and Q4. I think that serves us well. We also think the integration of body worn video and evidence management into the command center, given our incumbency and strong position across the different modules that broaden the whole suite and command center software, I like that position. And look, I also think we can grow internationally with body worn camera. And at the end of the day, the body worn video addressable market, we think, is about $500 million all in with body worn camera and evidence management. I think we have a great opportunity to take share and be a competitive compelling number two. But I also like the fixed video and access control addressable market being a multiple of that. Without China, we think it's about $15 billion. So there's a lot of room to run across the technologies, inclusive of body worn. But I think historically, that market has been served by one provider. Yes. I mean, Keith, I agree. And at the end of the day, we said things would improve sequentially in the back half of 2020 as sales engagement improved. I think that was a driver. I think there has been pent up demand and exactly what Jack just said. Even during a COVID year, I can't remember this number of new products that we invested in, in 2020. Yes, we managed discretionary expenses down. Yes, we didn't have travel incentives. We had a benefit on expenses. But at the same time, whether it was APX NEXT, a new TETRA device, Ion for PCR, cloud enabled modules in command center, refreshing the video security suite, we made a conscious effort to invest organically in product development. And I think that strong Q4 in part is because of some of those new products. Our whole intent was not only to come out of COVID but come out stronger than we went in. And I think Kelly and Jack particularly have done a great job on prioritizing new products and investments. So Paul, you're right. Q4 was better than we anticipated in PCR. So for the full year, as Jason just mentioned, it was down about $300 million. We had signaled it could be about $350 million, so a slight improvement. We do think it will continue to improve in 2021. And in fact, at this point, overall, I think our expectation is that it can grow. Now it will be incrementally as a number of different key verticals like transportation, airline, hospitality, oil and gas as they improve. But 2020 was pretty draconian. I look at it as more or less a floor, and our expectation is for PCR to return to growth in 2021. Now having said that, we still have to operate and execute on that against the supply constraints and limitations that are in front of us. But as we've started out the year in 2021, it's a good start. I think there's appetite and there's capacity. But if you take a step back, my priority is investing organically in the business. We have great markets. The technologies of land mobile radio, mission critical communications, all the trends around modernizing 911 and command center software and of course, all things video, fixed video and access control, as well as body worn, but these are big addressable markets, in combination approaching $40 billion of an addressable market, that's probably 3x greater than it was for this company five years ago or so. So prioritizing new products, and investments, by the way, an investment like the global manufacturing facility for fixed video in Richardson, Texas, to give us better scale, better capacity, lower unit cost. Jack talked about APX NEXT. He talked about TETRA. He talked about PCR. You know we're investing in the cloud. And by the way, we also bought back stock at attractive rates. We look at the long range plan. We do the DCF. We look at where we think this stock is attractive to buy back and we've been active on that front as well. $612 million of share repurchase last year, $289 million of acquisitions. And we did another double digit raise on dividend of 11% of $436 million. So yes, we continue to scan acquisition opportunities. There will probably be more around video security, software and services. But I think we've been good stewards of capital. We'll continue to be responsible on that front. But we like the prospects both organically and inorganically. Well, first of all, you're right. I don't think anybody else has the width and breadth of our portfolio. But our goal is to be the best and compelling across all three technologies. I mentioned the size of the addressable market. But I also think, and I referenced this a little bit in the opening remarks, I also think the special sauce is the integration of these technologies. Not only does not no one else have them but I think you're going to see us integrate them as well. Automated workflow, machine learning, AI powered analytics that allow -- I mean, there's volumes of video. And how do you see it, how do you watch it, how do you extract it, how do you redact it, how do you push it, to an incident to a dispatcher? And we're working not just having best in class point products for these technologies, and I like the hand of cards we're playing, but it's the orchestration and the integration led by our Chief Technology Officer, Mahesh Saptharishi, who's making great progress on the orchestration and integration. So you think about the things that are going on, whether it's social unrest, wildfires, immigration, there's a lot of trends, socially and environmentally that I think are favorable. There's a lot of technology trends that I think are favorable. And as we've talked about consistently about the overarching purpose of our company, of helping people be their best in the moments, those critical, mission-critical, literally moments that matter, that's the envelope of our vision and the technologies that we invest and the integration that we're pursuing. And I think there's more room to run, to your point, outside of the United States in a number of international theaters and stay tuned for us to share some more things on that front as well. Yes, Jim, I would say, remember, I mean, I think that engagements improved, new products getting traction, pent up demand, and we did have some benefit of CARES Act money, about $150 million in 2020 but also CARES funding is now extended through December of 2021. So there's a good level of continuity there. But you're right. I don't think as we describe the business and look at the visibility in terms of current demand signals, potential stimulus, potential infrastructure builds and things from Washington probably would be further enabling in some of the growth that we're expecting."

            "name": "JackMolloy",
            "content": "So Tim, just to kind of decompose your two questions, number one, in terms of our fixed video government sales, we're really pleased with the progress. If you remember when we acquired Avigilon, it was essentially a nascent business and very strong growth. In fact, fixed video growth in 2020 was north of 45% so we like that. That feels good. We also acquired Pelco. And I think it's important to point out that Pelco gave us federal government contractual mechanisms with which to sell upon and we enjoyed that, those contracts in 2020. So we feel good about that but more importantly, where we're going moving forward in 2021. With respect to mobile video, actually, we had a very strong year. If you look at the second half of the year, both Q3 and Q4, orders for body cams were up for us over 60% in both respective quarters. Fundamentally, what we're hearing from our customer base is customers want an alternative. I think with our market reach, our go to market coverage, our channels, I think we've got a reach to start to get into suburban rural municipalities as well, which is where we're going to start seeing the next level of decisions. The other piece of it that we haven't talked much about was we acquired a company called Edesix through our Avigilon acquisition. We had two international wins of over $1 million last year. And again, we think we're well set for the international market. The last thing and I think that really ties it all together and Greg hit it on the script is we're obviously launching a new digital evidence management platform this year with CommandCentral Evidence. We've got a differentiator and that our body worn and how mobile video flows ties into our full workflow with CAD mobile records and are obviously digital evidence management. So we're excited. We think we're well poised for the body worn space as well. Yes. And the only other thing I'd add on that, Greg, we don't think it's one or the other. As we said before, they all need to have technologies. Do you need body cams for accountability? Yes, without a doubt. And we've seen our growth over 60% both Q3 and Q4. But if you look at our performance from an LMR perspective, it was big deals like Nassau and New Jersey. But quite frankly, Q4 from a grassroots perspective, which we track was our strongest Q4 in five years. And so we think there's certainly opportunities on both ends of the spectrum and we think wallets won't be constrained, wallets will open up for more technology. So a few things. As you can imagine, part of this was we had, I would say, our engagement with customers, particularly in Q2, was slightly impaired. So we saw obviously the velocity of those engagements improve in the second half. But the other thing that I think we're going to start to see, particularly as it relates to Nassau County, which was one of the big deals that we cited in our script, was a mix to the APX NEXT, which we announced in October of 2019. Is that obviously come at an ASP appreciation for us? It does. But I think more importantly, as you look throughout the portfolio, you look at what Kelly has brought to market in command center software. You look at what we're doing from a PCR perspective. Just this week, we announced a category changer in the ion device, which combines a legacy PCR device but also does private LTE and CBRS in one device. And so we think some of the investments we've made from an R&D perspective on device refresh, on converging devices and those experiences will continue to provide kind of an upgrade, upsell opportunity for our customers. We think more to follow into 2021. And the thing we failed to mention just internationally as we start to see our momentum grow there is the MXP600, which was really the first major TETRA device announcement. And quite frankly, we were oversubscribed for that in Q4. We took as many orders we could ship. So we're happy with that too. So we've seen -- historically, five, six, seven years ago, people would hold the device for 10 years. The refresh cycle now looks more like six to seven years for a device. So obviously, within the US and globally, there's so many municipalities, law enforcement. But the one thing that I would say is that we've looked over history, the XTS family, the APX family, we typically get three to five years until the revenue becomes very meaningful, and so we're 2.5 years in. We feel like we've got a great amount of refresh cycle, both with the APX NEXT and then internationally with their MXP600 device. Ben, we invested in the Ion because we believe we had an opportunity to create a new category. So some of the things that it does, obviously, when we make an engineering decision to include higher throughput mechanisms like private LTE, CBRS, we want to do though because we have an eye on a workflow that a customer application. So as an example, it does image capture. It does scanning. It does things that no radio that we've ever made for the PCR space has ever done. So fundamentally, that creates new opportunities. Think of things like warehousing, manufacturing, even there's hospitality, stadium security type applications. We also think, as Greg referred to Safety Reimagine, as we start to see our video opportunities, access control, merge with PCR opportunities, we think that kind of device plays well into that environment too. So again, it would be accretive to what we typically do. It redefines the PCR category."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of this call over the internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investors. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference.\nTim Yocum: Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2020 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of Products & Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President of Software & Services. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A. We\u2019ve posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we\u2019ll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today\u2019s earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim. good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I\u2019ll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our Q3 results and outlook. First, I\u2019m proud of the team and I\u2019m pleased with our results and execution in these challenging times. During the quarter, we achieved both revenue and earnings per share above the guidance we provided in August driven by growth in video security, command center software and services. Additionally, we generated $392 million of operating cash flow and strengthened our portfolio by closing the acquisitions of Pelco, a leader in fixed video security solutions and Callyo, a cloud-based SaaS mobile apps provider for law enforcement. Second, our Software and Services segment continues to perform well. During the quarter, the segment grew revenue 9%, expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and generated over half of the operating earnings for the company. We were also awarded the largest command center software order in our history, $120 million plus next generation 911 multi-year contract. And finally, while the environment with COVID certainly remains fluid, I\u2019m encouraged by the improvements we saw in many areas of our business during the quarter. Orders for body-worn cameras were up significantly year-over-year. Sales of fixed video to our government customers were strong, and we saw improved demand from both our public safety LMR and PCR customers versus Q2. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Q3 results included revenue of $1.9 billion down 6% from a year ago, including $55 million from acquisitions. GAAP operating earnings of $352 million and operating margins of 18.9% of sales compared to 20.7% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $463 million down $46 million and non-GAAP operating margins of 24.8%, down from 25.5% in the year-ago quarter due to lower sales and gross margin contribution in the Products and SI segment partially offset by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. GAAP operating earnings per share were $1.18 compared to $1.51 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.95 versus $2.04 last year, primarily due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment partially offset by higher sales gross margin and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. OpEx in Q3 was $455 million, down $49 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary spend and incentives partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q3 effective tax rate was 20% compared to 23% in the year prior, a change driven primarily by higher R&D credits and a favorable U.S. Federal return to provision adjustment recorded in the third quarter. Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $392 million compared with $525 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $343 million compared with $465 million in the year prior. The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to lower sales. Capital allocation for Q3 included $181 million for acquisitions, $109 million in cash dividends, $105 million to share repurchases and $49 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we refinanced upcoming debt maturities with a new $900 million 10-year debt issuance at a rate of 2.3%. And finally, we repaid $400 million against our revolving credit facility, of which $300 million was repaid during the quarter and $100 million subsequent to quarter end. We expect to repay the remaining $100 million balance by year end. Moving to segment results, Q3 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion down 14% driven by a decline in public safety, LMR and PCR partially offset by growth in video security. Operating earnings were $219 million or 18.9% of sales down 330 basis points from last year, primarily due to lower sales. Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in the segment include a $44 million P25 order with a large U.S. Federal customer, a $28 million P25 order for the state of Wyoming, a $20 million P25 order for the state of North Carolina, a $19 million TETRA order for a large international transportation customer and we saw a strong growth in fixed video sales to government customers during the quarter. Moving to our Software and Services segment. Revenue was $705 million up 9% from last year, driven by growth in both services and software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $24 million. Operating earnings were $244 million or 34.6% of sales, up 220 basis points from last year driven by higher sales, gross margin and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q3 wins in the segment include and over $120 million next generation 911 multi-year contract, a $19 million body-worn and in-car video multi-year as a service contract in North America and an $18 million P25 multi-year services contract with Seminole County, Florida. Additionally, we received strong orders for body-worn cameras, launched our PremierOne Cloud software suite and closed the acquisition of Callyo, a cloud-based SaaS mobile application provider for law enforcement. Looking at regional results. North America Q3 revenue was $1.3 billion, down 6% due to declines in public safety, LMR and professional commercial radio, partially offset by growth in services, video security and software. International Q3 revenue was $600 million down, 8% primarily due to decline in public \u2013 professional and commercial radio and public safety LMR, partially offset by growth in services, video security and software. Sales grew in Europe while Latin America declined on continued challenges from COVID-19. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $10.7 billion down $361 million, compared to last year, driven by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts partially offset by growth in North America and $81 million of favorable currency rates. Sequentially, backlog was up $174 million, driven by growth in North America and $93 million of favorable currency rates. Software and Services backlog was down $44 million or 1% compared to last year due to revenue recognition on the Airwave, ESN contracts partially offset by growth in North America, multi-year agreements and $74 million of favorable currency rates. Sequentially backlog was up $138 million or 2% due to growth in North America and $83 million of favorable currency. Products and SI segment backlog was down $317 million or 10% compared to last year, primarily due to large international deployments and COVID-19 delaying some sales engagements. Sequentially, backlog was up $36 million or 1% driven primarily by international. Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales to be down between 6% and 5.5% with non-GAAP EPS between $2.71 and $2.76 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of 175 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. For the full year, we now expect sales to be down approximately 6.5%, up from our prior guidance of a 7% decline with non-GAAP EPS between $7.52 and $7.58, up from our prior guidance of $7.40 to $7.52, and our outlook for operating cash flow is now approximately $1.55 billion, up $50 million from our previous guidance, driven by higher earnings and improvements in working capital. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Jason. And let me just end with a few thoughts. First, I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making in our command center software business. Our command center software suite now covers the entire mission workflow from 911 intake to case closure and management. It\u2019s a $500 million business, which has been growing consistently and improving its profitability while also transitioning towards the SaaS model. Just this month, we announced our PremierOne Cloud suite, which includes fully functional CAD, and mobile and records solutions available on the secure Azure Government Cloud. So, this means we now can provide our customers the flexibility of deploying their software, either on-prem or in a fully featured cloud deployment. Currently, we have over 3,500 command center software customers with over 500 of those using two or more components of the suite. In Q3, half of our new orders were from customers further expanding into the suite, demonstrating this continued growth opportunity as customers embrace integrated software to run their operations. Second, the increased demand we\u2019re seeing for cloud solutions is not just in command center software. Customers are increasingly seeing the benefits of the cloud across their entire workflow. In LMR or land mobile radio, we\u2019ve launched our CirrusCentral cloud-based offerings for P25 networks that provide remote management and backup core options for our radio customers. In video security, we launched a video-as-a-service offering for body-worn cameras that includes our cloud-based digital evidence management software, as well as Avigilon cloud services, which now has over 4,000 ACC 7.x sites connected to the cloud. All of these subscription-based offerings provide increased capabilities to our customers and opportunities for us to grow recurring revenues. And finally, through the global pandemic, natural disasters and civil unrest, our customers continue to depend on and rely on our solutions as need to have, demonstrating the criticality of what we provide and our teams and people\u2019s resilience in support of our customers around the world was nothing and is nothing short of remarkable. Additionally, we were just recently recognized by the Wall Street Journal as one of the world\u2019s most sustainably managed companies ranking the sixth highest in the country. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on supporting both our customers and our people while also deploying the capital to drive growth and continued shareholder return. And with that, Tim, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.\nTim Yocum: Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I\u2019d like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask the question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi, there. thank you and congrats on the solid results in 3Q. I first wanted to ask about the $120 million 911 contract that you guys signed that was the highest in the company\u2019s history, and maybe two pieces to this. How will that that be recognized over time, kind of like the first question? And then I know there\u2019s probably going to be similar deals like this in the future, probably not at the same magnitude, but maybe, could you give us a little bit of an idea on how popular this type of specific large deal could potentially be in demand in the medium to long-term?\nKelly Mark: Sure. hey, Sami, it\u2019s Kelly. So, on the NGCS, I think I would say three things about it. First off, look, we\u2019re really excited about that part of the business. It is the entry point for all 911 calls, and as I think I may have referenced on a prior call, what that effectively does is creates the EazzyNet multi-lane highway entry point to 911 centers, where they can now handle video, audio, pictures, text, versus the single-lane highway of voice that they could handle before. The second thing I\u2019d say about this deal is when you think about it, this and other similar deals like that will get on NGCS. There\u2019s always an installation component that\u2019s upfront. And then there\u2019s a longer tale of as a service, where we\u2019ll run the system for our customers and that\u2019s similar to what we have here in the multi-year contract. The third thing I\u2019d just remind you about \u2013 around NGCS, is while we have some of our own software and componentry in it, we are also acting as a systems integrator. So, we are, in effect, reselling backhaul and other components as an offering for the entire solution, which is a bit different than what we do in our 911 call-taking software or our CAD software, where we are the entirety of the software solution. But we\u2019re excited about this. We think that NGCS and EazzyNet is \u2013 I would call it, if you\u2019re looking at a nine inning baseball game, I think we\u2019re somewhere around maybe, the second or the third inning, so we\u2019re early in the conversion of EazzyNet across the United States. So, there\u2019s certainly other deals out there, and we\u2019ll just continue to fight for those and update you on those as they come.\nGreg Brown: And Sami, this contract, $120 million plus, will be rev-recognized over a multi-year, long-term contract.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you. And then Greg, just one question for you. We still have the $9 billion of revenue and $10 EVP \u2013 EPS guideposts laid out for 2021, and obviously, COVID may have shifted this around a little bit, but I was hoping you\u2019d give us a little bit of an update around this guidepost or this framework on how we should be thinking about what\u2019s to come in the medium to long-term.\nGreg Brown: Yes. Well, obviously COVID was the ultimate disrupter, but I would say is I\u2019m pleased with the momentum of how the business is performing. We talked about Q2 of this year, Sami, being a low point. We would improve in Q3. We expect to improve in Q4. I think the print for this quarter reflects some of that improvement. All I would say look, I\u2019m not going to guide 2021. I think that would be premature. But I would say as we sit here today and I don\u2019t have a crystal ball, I would expect us to grow and return to overall revenue growth next year, and I would also expect us to grow in both segments for next year. but again, we\u2019ll update you a quarter from now on the next earnings call.\nSami Badri: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Sami.\nOperator: Our next question is from George Notter of Jeffries. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys. thanks very much. I was really interested in some of your comments, Greg, on the software business. I think you mentioned a $500 million run rate at this point. Can you talk a little bit more about how that \u2013 I would imagine that run rate is getting cannibalized to some degree as you move customers from perpetual software licenses to a subscription, and can you talk about potential cannibalization on that revenue run rate, or maybe, talk about the mixture of customers that are converting to subscription, or anything you can that give us more insight in that transition. Thanks.\nKelly Mark: Sure, George. So, the majority of the software revenue today is license revenue. Kelly and Andrew have done a good job, Cloud-enabling the suite. The only component left to Cloud-enable is Records, which will be done in the first half of 2021. So, we\u2019re incrementally moving more and more customers to as-a-service. But again, I think we\u2019re still going to be able to manage that transition from perpetual license incrementally to more as a service without any major dislocation or disruption of top-line revenues. Said another way, you see that Software and Services will perform this year in the high single digits and I expect Software and Services in total in the segment and both sub segments, Software and Services, to continue to grow in 2021 as well, even while we\u2019re transitioning those clients gradually to as-a-service. I view that as a multiyear transition.\nGreg Brown: And George, the only thing I might add to Kelly is the \u2013 we\u2019re really excited about the command center software suite we just announced, which now fully cloud-enables CAD, records, and our mobile. That\u2019s in addition to already what we do in Aware, our vast license plate recognition is as-a-service, and also, our Kodiak part of the portfolio as well. The only part of the entirety of what we have that won\u2019t be cloud-enabled yet is our 911 call taking. That should happen in the first half of next year. And in addition to that, we\u2019re excited about what we just did with Callyo, the acquisition we just did, which picks up a very large customer base of folks that are using that mobile application, which is also an as-a-service part of the portfolio.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. Okay. And then one just quick housekeeping item. I didn\u2019t see it in the press release or the presentation, but was there an FX impact on top line in the quarter and can you tell us what that was? Thanks.\nGreg Brown: It was pretty small.\nGeorge Notter: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question today is from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. I was hoping you could shed a light on the ability to do sales this quarter, in terms of last quarter, I think what we heard was about challenges in terms of getting in to see the customers. How would that develop over the third quarter and is that a challenge going into the fourth quarter?\nJack Molloy: Sure. Hey, Keith, it\u2019s Jack. Good afternoon. Yes. So, we saw sequential improvement in terms of our ability to engaging customers and just to kind of give you the geographic around the world. First of all, in North America, in government, we\u2019ve been able to engage in person with customers and we\u2019ve seen that manifest in terms of increase in proposals and sequential increase in terms of our LMR business and as Kelly pointed out, command center and video. In Europe, it\u2019s important to point out 55% of our revenue in Europe is recurring revenue. But we are starting to see, we saw certainly in Q3, both in the enterprise market and government, the ability of our customers to actually come, and extend and meet us virtually. So, that\u2019s been an improvement. Asia-Pac, same thing. The one area of the world, where we\u2019re having essentially lockdown, continues to be lockdown and we\u2019ve got very much diminished expectations is Latin America. But I would certainly say it\u2019s improved, been really proud of the resilience of the team in terms of use of videoconferencing and really trying to engage our customers and pull them along. We\u2019ve been heavy in terms of virtual trade shows and demonstrations. And as I said in government; particularly, in public safety, we engage with our customers in person masked up, et cetera.\nGreg Brown: And Keith, just one other anecdote I\u2019d give you is we just completed Kelly\u2019s team, the Annual Software Summit just a few days ago. We did it in person a year ago. We just completed the virtual multiday engagement just a few days ago, and attendance was literally double virtually. So, I think Molloy\u2019s team and Kelly\u2019s team, and our customers quite frankly, have been good in transitioning virtual engagement, digital engagement, business continuity. It depends on the theaters Jack referenced internationally, but we\u2019ve been able to navigate that much better than we were doing a quarter ago.\nKeith Housum: Got you. Appreciate that. And just a follow-up there. In terms of changing gears actually, in terms of like FirstNet and Airwave, can you give us the latest on where LTE versus LMR kind of stands in terms of around the world?\nGreg Brown: I think the high-level answer is no change from the last time we spoke to you. 4G and ultimately, as it transitions here in North America to 5G, LTE or 5G is a complimentary technology to mission critical land mobile radio. I think the awards that Winkler went through on state awards and upgrades, particularly in state and local reinforce and reference the criticality need to have dimensions of land mobile radio. As it relates to Airwave, I think it\u2019s the same thing. We believe \u2013 we remain in active discussions with the customer and we do have an expectation that that Airwave contract will get another extension. But that timing will be dictated largely by the customer. But again, I think LMR, LTE, or if you want to substitute that and say LMR 5G coexist, and quite frankly, we think the upgrade in faster speeds domestically and in the UK are good for command center, good for our video security business and overall, are a net positive.\nKeith Housum: Great. thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Greg, I just wanted to start with a question on margins. Between the two segments, it\u2019s been a little tale of two cities. In Products and SI, that\u2019s been the drag on overall performance, but probably, the biggest opportunity moving forward. So, hoping you can maybe, just walk through some of the moving parts to get this segment back to the kind of 22% to 23% operating margin range from years past. Does revenue need to get back above $5 billion? Are there things you can do from an opex standpoint and just a timing to that?\nGreg Brown: Yes, Adam. So, kind of taking \u2013 let\u2019s take a look at OpEx overall. For the full year, we\u2019ll remove about $250 million of OpEx out of this business this year year-over-year. If you net that to include acquisitions, it\u2019s a net $170 million reduction. So, I think the team has moved quickly and did a good job on expense structure, both structural and variable, to adapt to the COVID environment we got hit with a couple of quarters ago. So, think of OpEx this year, all in, year-over-year, being down net $170 million, about approximately $100 million of that returns next year in the form of incentive compensation. Operating margins for the two segments, we still expect Software and Services to be consistent with what we told you last time, with operating margins for the full year 2020 of being about 34%. Obviously, the product segment declines this year, given the top-line volume decline. I expect the operating margins obviously to improve with volume. And even though $100 million of OpEx returns next year, that\u2019s as we sit here today, we\u2019ll always look to see if we can refine or further improve that cost structure. But that\u2019s kind of a composite view.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. And maybe, just as a follow-up, I\u2019d imagine from a top-line standpoint, one of the big drivers in that segment is going to be the PCR business. If you could just maybe, just update us on where that business fits today, and into 4Q, so that we can kind of think about the opportunity moving forward into 2021 as it potentially rebounds?\nGreg Brown: Yes. I think that PCR has been incrementally \u2013 it clearly was an extreme low point in Q2. It\u2019s performed a little bit better in Q3 and we expect it to improve a little bit better, that\u2019s informed into our overall Q4 guidance. PCR, as you know, has been hit with primarily, the critical industries that have gotten slammed by COVID the most: hospitality, entertainment, transportation, oil and gas, and quite frankly, I think that we expect PCR to return to some form of growth in 2021. And that\u2019s in part what informs our expectations for the product segment to return to growth as well. It also might be worth noting that even in this environment, North America, which represents our largest theater and is sold primarily through channels. the channel inventory in North America is down. So that\u2019s a good \u2013 that\u2019s another good indicator in terms of potential foundation for us to continue to print improvement as time goes on.\nJack Molloy: And maybe, one other thing, Greg. Just historically as we look at PCR, new product introduction, even in challenging times, equates to growth, and we do have some product refresh on the slate for 2021 as well.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. Thanks, Greg. Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tim Long of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Yes, two if I could here. Greg, maybe first, just talk a little bit high level about the state of your customers, state and local budgeting, given the macro and stimulus and anything of note there, any changes? And then secondly, if you could talk a little bit on the video side? You mentioned that getting good traction with the government to maybe, just give us a little bit more color there, how much video is ramping there, and are you seeing kind of any level of cross-selling across that video business? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Sure, Tim. Just to take them in reverse order, on video specifically, let\u2019s start out with body-worn video. We had the strongest quarter we\u2019ve had. Really, good demand for a lot of the obvious demand driver reasons you would suspect, but I think Molloy and John Kedzierski and the team are doing a good job with the acquisition we made there in the form of WatchGuard. Quite frankly, also another impetus behind the body-worn video growth is international performance, which came through an acquisition as a part of WatchGuard called Edesix. So, I like our performance there and also, I like the increased demand. We also did have strong growth in fixed video to government, solid double-digit growth. I think a reflection of \u2013 we\u2019ve said the sales cycle is always longer in state and local and fed, but very good performance on fixed video into the government. By the way, Pelco being a benefit to that as well, given the fact that that acquisition came with a lot of contractual government clearances that allowed us to move right in to further fed government purchases that were beneficial. In terms of state and local customers, Jack mentioned it. I think that our customers have found a good way to engage during these challenging times. Many of them do meet in person. We also meet digitally or virtually. And remember, the state and local budgets have been largely set. So that\u2019s a good thing that moves us well into next year. We\u2019ve also been the beneficiaries of CARES Act money from the feds, and I think that has had a favorable impact as well. So I don\u2019t know, Jack, if you want to add anything on the state and local budgets beyond that?\nJack Molloy: No, Tim, I think it\u2019s just prioritization, prioritization, prioritization. As you\u2019ve heard me mention before, we\u2019re not in the business of a nice to have, we\u2019re in the business of a need to have in terms of emergency response. So really, we continue to see our customers drive projects through. The other thing is, I think that sometimes losses, there\u2019s just a multitude of different funding sources. Greg talked about CARES Act, but there\u2019s also things like special purpose local option taxes, which are still getting passed. And so we remain highly engaged with our customers. We see great demand across the portfolio and government and as we know with what\u2019s happening in the world right now, security means a great deal to cities, to states, and I think to our federal government. So more to follow, but we\u2019re encouraged with what we see.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you very much.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: Greg, I think, I heard somebody mention that your business is 55% recurring. What is recurring revenue for the overall company?\nGreg Brown: No, I think Molloy\u2019s reference was that the majority of our European revenue is recurring, largely because of the Airwave contract.\nPaul Silverstein: My fault.\nGreg Brown: No, that\u2019s all right, Paul, but if you look at overall, Software and Services, which we view as largely a proxy for recurring. This year, in full year 2020, Software and Services will be higher than 35% for this year, which we view as a favorable byproduct of the year, I guess, so that\u2019s good.\nPaul Silverstein: Then as a follow-up. On the government\u2019s piece of video, looking out to next year, coming off this year, any quantification you can provide us, ballpark in terms of how big \u2013 I know you just started selling over a year ago, but how big can that business be next year, and how big will it be this year?\nGreg Brown: Well, so just to kind of \u2013 if you take all of the video assets that we have, fixed, body-worn, in-car, license plate recognition, domestically and internationally, this business, all-in for assets, hardware, software, is likely to be about $940 million, Paul, for this year. You\u2019ve heard us talk about growing it 3x the market. That 3x the market is around the fixed video and access control piece, which we still believe we can achieve. If you take the size of the video market, all-in, worldwide, and we always zero China out, given their indigenous competitors, this is about an $18 billion \u2013 $17 billion to $18 billion business, addressable market. It\u2019s actually the largest addressable market we have. So, I think there\u2019s room to run here with the assets we\u2019ve accumulated along with the analytics that our team is developing and intelligent edge devices as well.\nPaul Silverstein: Greg, I appreciate that. I was actually focused on the government piece market that you entered back about a year ago.\nKelly Mark: I think he\u2019s \u2013 hey, Paul. So, I think we had mentioned probably maybe three calls ago, probably nine months ago, the question was asked, hey, how big is your government video business? And really, we said approximately $200 million at the time, and that\u2019s an aggregation of two things. It\u2019s the mobile video market that\u2019s come through vis-\u00e0-vis, the WatchGuard acquisition, as well as Greg had mentioned, the Edesix that also came as an acquisition. The remnants of it are fixed video security sales into all governments, and I would tell you, both of those businesses are growing strong double-digits right now. Both fixed video into government, we\u2019ve talked about the success we had in Q3, both in the feds and state and local, but also, we highlighted some of the success we had in body-worn in terms of unit and dollar bookings substantially up in the strong double-digits there. So hopefully, that helps.\nPaul Silverstein: I appreciate that. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Fahad Najam of MKM. Please go ahead.\nFahad Najam: Thanks for taking my question. Greg, I want to ask you a big picture question. In light of the view that most of your government customers are very slow to move and they tend to be not driven by \u2013 like usually, enterprises are driven by profits and maximizing profits, your government customers tend to be more slower. Are you noticing any kind of an inflection point in your government customers\u2019 decision-making when it comes to whether it\u2019s Next Gen 911 command center solutions or video? Are we beginning on a new trend and that\u2019s going to accelerate going forward?\nGreg Brown: I would say this. I mean, in the command center software, Next Gen 911 is a new opportunity for us, and that\u2019s obviously a favorable trend. The other thing I\u2019d say, in terms of decision cycles is command center software, historically has had some of the oldest legacy technology and workflow processes literally over several years, 10, 15 years plus. So, I actually think that the inflection point is COVID-induced in part that\u2019s accelerating decisions to the cloud. Traditionally state and local customers would prefer control, and they\u2019d confer \u2013 they\u2019d prefer on-prem. I actually think that this pandemic has been a positive accelerant to decision-making around command center software, particularly around cloud. I think this suite that Kelly and Andrew\u2019s team has built also can be an accelerant to decision-making because instead of trying to decide a forklift process and an all or nothing, you can get an anchor tenant module in place and then upgrade those modules for additional components along the suite. On land mobile radio, we literally have tens of thousands of different contracts that are at different lengths and the systems are in different ages. The pandemic and the civil unrest has been an accelerant to some older systems here in North America that needed to be upgraded to digital and with state-of-the-art encryption to protect the communities and the local law enforcement better. I think as Molloy and his team have built new devices, APX NEXT, in TETRA, the MPX600 that\u2019s just announced, those two represent events and opportunities for our customers to make decisions to refresh as well.\nKelly Mark: Greg, you hit it really well. I think the other thing that \u2013 we have a compelling ecosystem for our customers. That\u2019s an overused term, but I say that under the lens of Greg nailed it. Devices that work with command center, how do you extract, how do you disseminate information in a mobile environment? Those are the expectations that we\u2019ve seen, frankly, for a number of years in the enterprise space and government is certainly catching up to that. And I think those will be accelerants moving forward for us in public safety.\nFahad Najam: Thanks. You touched upon a follow-up piece that I wanted to ask, which is, as your government customers migrate command and control infrastructure to Next Gen digital platforms, is that creating a resulting opportunity in new applications like mission critical push to talk features on the radio? And if that\u2019s the case, are you beginning to see that and can you quantify that opportunity?\nKelly Mark: This is Kelly. I would say, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s offering up those type of opportunities in the mission critical push to talk, but it offers up the opportunity to enrich the whole workflow with multimedia. And at the edge, officers today carry a mobile device with them. They can receive now from the command center video, images, and data that they couldn\u2019t receive before. But the radio as part of the workflow is instrumental in regards to its uniqueness of its communication that it provides. So it\u2019s not so much about mission-critical push to talk as much as it\u2019s about enriching the entire command center workflow with all the information that we\u2019re very used to dealing with today in our day-to-day lives. It\u2019s now enabling that across that mission critical operational workflow so they can manage that information from 911 call intake to record in case management at the end.\nFahad Najam: If I can rephrase my question, which was a little bit more simpler, I wasn\u2019t particularly honing in on mission critical push to talk. What I was trying to get at is are you beginning to see a refresh of your devices business as a result of the upgrade in the new command and control software that you\u2019re now selling?\nKelly Mark: Yes, we are. So, we announced last October the APX NEXT device. We\u2019ve already built north of $100 million in terms of funnel opportunities for that. We\u2019re very encouraged. Remember, we introduced devices at the top end. So as we get through 2021, we\u2019ll start to broaden the reach of those devices. We see great demand for those devices because it\u2019s not only purpose built P25 communications, which is truly bedrock of how cities and states and public safety communicate, but to bring in LTE capabilities for back up push to talk, the ability to do on the fly programming and those kinds of things, it brings a number of those different things, so excited about that. Greg talked about, just this week, we announced a collaborative device for the TETRA market in Europe, and essentially we\u2019re booked out for the year this year, so we\u2019re really encouraged about that as well. So, we see a need for devices that can do more for our customers as I said earlier in terms of aggregating, disseminating, and really intelligence within their ecosystem.\nFahad Najam: Appreciate the answers. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead.\nJosh Kehoe: Hi, this is Josh Kehoe on for Jim Suva. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you provide any more color on the headwinds you\u2019re facing in the public safety LMR business and when you expect to be through them? And is it largely due to COVID-19 or is there more to it? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: I think the headwinds we talked about when COVID hit us back in March were PCR and the industries that were affected by it and public safety LMR, quote-unquote, being pushed to the right. The push to the right largely around sales engagement and deployments, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed at all. That\u2019s still the primary reason for the push to the right. Although I will tell you, it performed \u2013 its public safety LMR performed better than our expectations in Q3, and we expect it to improve again in Q4, which informs our guide. And I think public safety LMR and PCR, as I referenced earlier, I think will both improve, which will primarily drive why we expect the product segment to return to growth next year. There\u2019s a lot of still budget sources that Molloy referenced, we\u2019ve been the beneficiaries of The CARES Act as well, but that\u2019s what I would say.\nJack Molloy: Yes, the only thing I\u2019d just piggyback onto Greg\u2019s comments there, the one issue that we\u2019ve been challenged with is actually physical deployment of systems in the Middle East and Africa and in Latin America. So, we\u2019re completely impaired to go do anything, and that\u2019s really elongated our ability to recognize revenues in those theaters.\nJosh Kehoe: Okay. And as a follow-up, as we look into 2021, how are you thinking about prioritizing M&A versus share repurchases? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: I think that our capital allocation framework is 50-30-20. 50% of the cash flow being available for either acquisitions or share repurchase. It\u2019s a fungible amount, depending upon the opportunities that are in front of us. 30% is dividend, and 20% is CapEx. So that framework, loosely, is that it\u2019s not meant to be a prescription, but it\u2019s a framework. We were active in buying back shares at these levels, as you\u2019ve seen in Q3. We think these are attractive levels to buy the stock in Q3. And we\u2019ll evaluate opportunities as they come. We\u2019ve done tuck-in acquisitions on the video side, on the software side. I think that in regards to acquisitions next year, it will be, in part, a reflection of what opportunities come our way. But that\u2019s the thinking around the deployment of capital at this point.\nJosh Kehoe: Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.\nTim Yocum: No additional comments. Thanks for joining us today. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. And a replay of this call will be available over the internet in approximately three hours.

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Q3 results included revenue of $1.9 billion down 6% from a year ago, including $55 million from acquisitions. GAAP operating earnings of $352 million and operating margins of 18.9% of sales compared to 20.7% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $463 million down $46 million and non-GAAP operating margins of 24.8%, down from 25.5% in the year-ago quarter due to lower sales and gross margin contribution in the Products and SI segment partially offset by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. GAAP operating earnings per share were $1.18 compared to $1.51 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.95 versus $2.04 last year, primarily due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment partially offset by higher sales gross margin and improved operating leverage in Software and Services. OpEx in Q3 was $455 million, down $49 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary spend and incentives partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q3 effective tax rate was 20% compared to 23% in the year prior, a change driven primarily by higher R&D credits and a favorable U.S. Federal return to provision adjustment recorded in the third quarter. Turning to cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $392 million compared with $525 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $343 million compared with $465 million in the year prior. The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to lower sales. Capital allocation for Q3 included $181 million for acquisitions, $109 million in cash dividends, $105 million to share repurchases and $49 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we refinanced upcoming debt maturities with a new $900 million 10-year debt issuance at a rate of 2.3%. And finally, we repaid $400 million against our revolving credit facility, of which $300 million was repaid during the quarter and $100 million subsequent to quarter end. We expect to repay the remaining $100 million balance by year end. Moving to segment results, Q3 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion down 14% driven by a decline in public safety, LMR and PCR partially offset by growth in video security. Operating earnings were $219 million or 18.9% of sales down 330 basis points from last year, primarily due to lower sales. Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in the segment include a $44 million P25 order with a large U.S. Federal customer, a $28 million P25 order for the state of Wyoming, a $20 million P25 order for the state of North Carolina, a $19 million TETRA order for a large international transportation customer and we saw a strong growth in fixed video sales to government customers during the quarter. Moving to our Software and Services segment. Revenue was $705 million up 9% from last year, driven by growth in both services and software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $24 million. Operating earnings were $244 million or 34.6% of sales, up 220 basis points from last year driven by higher sales, gross margin and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q3 wins in the segment include and over $120 million next generation 911 multi-year contract, a $19 million body-worn and in-car video multi-year as a service contract in North America and an $18 million P25 multi-year services contract with Seminole County, Florida. Additionally, we received strong orders for body-worn cameras, launched our PremierOne Cloud software suite and closed the acquisition of Callyo, a cloud-based SaaS mobile application provider for law enforcement. Looking at regional results. North America Q3 revenue was $1.3 billion, down 6% due to declines in public safety, LMR and professional commercial radio, partially offset by growth in services, video security and software. International Q3 revenue was $600 million down, 8% primarily due to decline in public \u2013 professional and commercial radio and public safety LMR, partially offset by growth in services, video security and software. Sales grew in Europe while Latin America declined on continued challenges from COVID-19. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $10.7 billion down $361 million, compared to last year, driven by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts partially offset by growth in North America and $81 million of favorable currency rates. Sequentially, backlog was up $174 million, driven by growth in North America and $93 million of favorable currency rates. Software and Services backlog was down $44 million or 1% compared to last year due to revenue recognition on the Airwave, ESN contracts partially offset by growth in North America, multi-year agreements and $74 million of favorable currency rates. Sequentially backlog was up $138 million or 2% due to growth in North America and $83 million of favorable currency. Products and SI segment backlog was down $317 million or 10% compared to last year, primarily due to large international deployments and COVID-19 delaying some sales engagements. Sequentially, backlog was up $36 million or 1% driven primarily by international. Turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales to be down between 6% and 5.5% with non-GAAP EPS between $2.71 and $2.76 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of 175 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. For the full year, we now expect sales to be down approximately 6.5%, up from our prior guidance of a 7% decline with non-GAAP EPS between $7.52 and $7.58, up from our prior guidance of $7.40 to $7.52, and our outlook for operating cash flow is now approximately $1.55 billion, up $50 million from our previous guidance, driven by higher earnings and improvements in working capital. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg."

            "name": "Kelly Mark",
            "content": "Sure. hey, Sami, it's Kelly. So, on the NGCS, I think I would say three things about it. First off, look, we're really excited about that part of the business. It is the entry point for all 911 calls, and as I think I may have referenced on a prior call, what that effectively does is creates the EazzyNet multi-lane highway entry point to 911 centers, where they can now handle video, audio, pictures, text, versus the single-lane highway of voice that they could handle before. The second thing I'd say about this deal is when you think about it, this and other similar deals like that will get on NGCS. There's always an installation component that's upfront. And then there's a longer tale of as a service, where we'll run the system for our customers and that's similar to what we have here in the multi-year contract. The third thing I'd just remind you about \u2013 around NGCS, is while we have some of our own software and componentry in it, we are also acting as a systems integrator. So, we are, in effect, reselling backhaul and other components as an offering for the entire solution, which is a bit different than what we do in our 911 call-taking software or our CAD software, where we are the entirety of the software solution. But we're excited about this. We think that NGCS and EazzyNet is \u2013 I would call it, if you're looking at a nine inning baseball game, I think we're somewhere around maybe, the second or the third inning, so we're early in the conversion of EazzyNet across the United States. So, there's certainly other deals out there, and we'll just continue to fight for those and update you on those as they come. Sure, George. So, the majority of the software revenue today is license revenue. Kelly and Andrew have done a good job, Cloud-enabling the suite. The only component left to Cloud-enable is Records, which will be done in the first half of 2021. So, we're incrementally moving more and more customers to as-a-service. But again, I think we're still going to be able to manage that transition from perpetual license incrementally to more as a service without any major dislocation or disruption of top-line revenues. Said another way, you see that Software and Services will perform this year in the high single digits and I expect Software and Services in total in the segment and both sub segments, Software and Services, to continue to grow in 2021 as well, even while we're transitioning those clients gradually to as-a-service. I view that as a multiyear transition. I think he's \u2013 hey, Paul. So, I think we had mentioned probably maybe three calls ago, probably nine months ago, the question was asked, hey, how big is your government video business? And really, we said approximately $200 million at the time, and that's an aggregation of two things. It's the mobile video market that's come through vis-a\u0300-vis, the WatchGuard acquisition, as well as Greg had mentioned, the Edesix that also came as an acquisition. The remnants of it are fixed video security sales into all governments, and I would tell you, both of those businesses are growing strong double-digits right now. Both fixed video into government, we've talked about the success we had in Q3, both in the feds and state and local, but also, we highlighted some of the success we had in body-worn in terms of unit and dollar bookings substantially up in the strong double-digits there. So hopefully, that helps. Greg, you hit it really well. I think the other thing that \u2013 we have a compelling ecosystem for our customers. That's an overused term, but I say that under the lens of Greg nailed it. Devices that work with command center, how do you extract, how do you disseminate information in a mobile environment? Those are the expectations that we've seen, frankly, for a number of years in the enterprise space and government is certainly catching up to that. And I think those will be accelerants moving forward for us in public safety. This is Kelly. I would say, it's not that it's offering up those type of opportunities in the mission critical push to talk, but it offers up the opportunity to enrich the whole workflow with multimedia. And at the edge, officers today carry a mobile device with them. They can receive now from the command center video, images, and data that they couldn't receive before. But the radio as part of the workflow is instrumental in regards to its uniqueness of its communication that it provides. So it's not so much about mission-critical push to talk as much as it's about enriching the entire command center workflow with all the information that we're very used to dealing with today in our day-to-day lives. It's now enabling that across that mission critical operational workflow so they can manage that information from 911 call intake to record in case management at the end. Yes, we are. So, we announced last October the APX NEXT device. We've already built north of $100 million in terms of funnel opportunities for that. We're very encouraged. Remember, we introduced devices at the top end. So as we get through 2021, we'll start to broaden the reach of those devices. We see great demand for those devices because it's not only purpose built P25 communications, which is truly bedrock of how cities and states and public safety communicate, but to bring in LTE capabilities for back up push to talk, the ability to do on the fly programming and those kinds of things, it brings a number of those different things, so excited about that. Greg talked about, just this week, we announced a collaborative device for the TETRA market in Europe, and essentially we're booked out for the year this year, so we're really encouraged about that as well. So, we see a need for devices that can do more for our customers as I said earlier in terms of aggregating, disseminating, and really intelligence within their ecosystem."

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our Q3 results and outlook. First, I'm proud of the team and I'm pleased with our results and execution in these challenging times. During the quarter, we achieved both revenue and earnings per share above the guidance we provided in August driven by growth in video security, command center software and services. Additionally, we generated $392 million of operating cash flow and strengthened our portfolio by closing the acquisitions of Pelco, a leader in fixed video security solutions and Callyo, a cloud-based SaaS mobile apps provider for law enforcement. Second, our Software and Services segment continues to perform well. During the quarter, the segment grew revenue 9%, expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and generated over half of the operating earnings for the company. We were also awarded the largest command center software order in our history, $120 million plus next generation 911 multi-year contract. And finally, while the environment with COVID certainly remains fluid, I'm encouraged by the improvements we saw in many areas of our business during the quarter. Orders for body-worn cameras were up significantly year-over-year. Sales of fixed video to our government customers were strong, and we saw improved demand from both our public safety LMR and PCR customers versus Q2. I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thanks, Jason. And let me just end with a few thoughts. First, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in our command center software business. Our command center software suite now covers the entire mission workflow from 911 intake to case closure and management. It's a $500 million business, which has been growing consistently and improving its profitability while also transitioning towards the SaaS model. Just this month, we announced our PremierOne Cloud suite, which includes fully functional CAD, and mobile and records solutions available on the secure Azure Government Cloud. So, this means we now can provide our customers the flexibility of deploying their software, either on-prem or in a fully featured cloud deployment. Currently, we have over 3,500 command center software customers with over 500 of those using two or more components of the suite. In Q3, half of our new orders were from customers further expanding into the suite, demonstrating this continued growth opportunity as customers embrace integrated software to run their operations. Second, the increased demand we're seeing for cloud solutions is not just in command center software. Customers are increasingly seeing the benefits of the cloud across their entire workflow. In LMR or land mobile radio, we've launched our CirrusCentral cloud-based offerings for P25 networks that provide remote management and backup core options for our radio customers. In video security, we launched a video-as-a-service offering for body-worn cameras that includes our cloud-based digital evidence management software, as well as Avigilon cloud services, which now has over 4,000 ACC 7.x sites connected to the cloud. All of these subscription-based offerings provide increased capabilities to our customers and opportunities for us to grow recurring revenues. And finally, through the global pandemic, natural disasters and civil unrest, our customers continue to depend on and rely on our solutions as need to have, demonstrating the criticality of what we provide and our teams and people's resilience in support of our customers around the world was nothing and is nothing short of remarkable. Additionally, we were just recently recognized by the Wall Street Journal as one of the world's most sustainably managed companies ranking the sixth highest in the country. As we move forward, we will continue to focus on supporting both our customers and our people while also deploying the capital to drive growth and continued shareholder return. And with that, Tim, I'll turn it back to you. And Sami, this contract, $120 million plus, will be rev-recognized over a multi-year, long-term contract. Yes. Well, obviously COVID was the ultimate disrupter, but I would say is I'm pleased with the momentum of how the business is performing. We talked about Q2 of this year, Sami, being a low point. We would improve in Q3. We expect to improve in Q4. I think the print for this quarter reflects some of that improvement. All I would say look, I'm not going to guide 2021. I think that would be premature. But I would say as we sit here today and I don't have a crystal ball, I would expect us to grow and return to overall revenue growth next year, and I would also expect us to grow in both segments for next year. but again, we'll update you a quarter from now on the next earnings call. Thanks, Sami. And George, the only thing I might add to Kelly is the \u2013 we're really excited about the command center software suite we just announced, which now fully cloud-enables CAD, records, and our mobile. That's in addition to already what we do in Aware, our vast license plate recognition is as-a-service, and also, our Kodiak part of the portfolio as well. The only part of the entirety of what we have that won't be cloud-enabled yet is our 911 call taking. That should happen in the first half of next year. And in addition to that, we're excited about what we just did with Callyo, the acquisition we just did, which picks up a very large customer base of folks that are using that mobile application, which is also an as-a-service part of the portfolio. It was pretty small. And Keith, just one other anecdote I'd give you is we just completed Kelly's team, the Annual Software Summit just a few days ago. We did it in person a year ago. We just completed the virtual multiday engagement just a few days ago, and attendance was literally double virtually. So, I think Molloy's team and Kelly's team, and our customers quite frankly, have been good in transitioning virtual engagement, digital engagement, business continuity. It depends on the theaters Jack referenced internationally, but we've been able to navigate that much better than we were doing a quarter ago. I think the high-level answer is no change from the last time we spoke to you. 4G and ultimately, as it transitions here in North America to 5G, LTE or 5G is a complimentary technology to mission critical land mobile radio. I think the awards that Winkler went through on state awards and upgrades, particularly in state and local reinforce and reference the criticality need to have dimensions of land mobile radio. As it relates to Airwave, I think it's the same thing. We believe \u2013 we remain in active discussions with the customer and we do have an expectation that that Airwave contract will get another extension. But that timing will be dictated largely by the customer. But again, I think LMR, LTE, or if you want to substitute that and say LMR 5G coexist, and quite frankly, we think the upgrade in faster speeds domestically and in the UK are good for command center, good for our video security business and overall, are a net positive. Thank you. Yes, Adam. So, kind of taking \u2013 let's take a look at OpEx overall. For the full year, we'll remove about $250 million of OpEx out of this business this year year-over-year. If you net that to include acquisitions, it's a net $170 million reduction. So, I think the team has moved quickly and did a good job on expense structure, both structural and variable, to adapt to the COVID environment we got hit with a couple of quarters ago. So, think of OpEx this year, all in, year-over-year, being down net $170 million, about approximately $100 million of that returns next year in the form of incentive compensation. Operating margins for the two segments, we still expect Software and Services to be consistent with what we told you last time, with operating margins for the full year 2020 of being about 34%. Obviously, the product segment declines this year, given the top-line volume decline. I expect the operating margins obviously to improve with volume. And even though $100 million of OpEx returns next year, that's as we sit here today, we'll always look to see if we can refine or further improve that cost structure. But that's kind of a composite view. Yes. I think that PCR has been incrementally \u2013 it clearly was an extreme low point in Q2. It's performed a little bit better in Q3 and we expect it to improve a little bit better, that's informed into our overall Q4 guidance. PCR, as you know, has been hit with primarily, the critical industries that have gotten slammed by COVID the most: hospitality, entertainment, transportation, oil and gas, and quite frankly, I think that we expect PCR to return to some form of growth in 2021. And that's in part what informs our expectations for the product segment to return to growth as well. It also might be worth noting that even in this environment, North America, which represents our largest theater and is sold primarily through channels. the channel inventory in North America is down. So that's a good \u2013 that's another good indicator in terms of potential foundation for us to continue to print improvement as time goes on. Sure, Tim. Just to take them in reverse order, on video specifically, let's start out with body-worn video. We had the strongest quarter we've had. Really, good demand for a lot of the obvious demand driver reasons you would suspect, but I think Molloy and John Kedzierski and the team are doing a good job with the acquisition we made there in the form of WatchGuard. Quite frankly, also another impetus behind the body-worn video growth is international performance, which came through an acquisition as a part of WatchGuard called Edesix. So, I like our performance there and also, I like the increased demand. We also did have strong growth in fixed video to government, solid double-digit growth. I think a reflection of \u2013 we've said the sales cycle is always longer in state and local and fed, but very good performance on fixed video into the government. By the way, Pelco being a benefit to that as well, given the fact that that acquisition came with a lot of contractual government clearances that allowed us to move right in to further fed government purchases that were beneficial. In terms of state and local customers, Jack mentioned it. I think that our customers have found a good way to engage during these challenging times. Many of them do meet in person. We also meet digitally or virtually. And remember, the state and local budgets have been largely set. So that's a good thing that moves us well into next year. We've also been the beneficiaries of CARES Act money from the feds, and I think that has had a favorable impact as well. So I don't know, Jack, if you want to add anything on the state and local budgets beyond that? Thanks, Tim. No, I think Molloy's reference was that the majority of our European revenue is recurring, largely because of the Airwave contract. No, that's all right, Paul, but if you look at overall, Software and Services, which we view as largely a proxy for recurring. This year, in full year 2020, Software and Services will be higher than 35% for this year, which we view as a favorable byproduct of the year, I guess, so that's good. Well, so just to kind of \u2013 if you take all of the video assets that we have, fixed, body-worn, in-car, license plate recognition, domestically and internationally, this business, all-in for assets, hardware, software, is likely to be about $940 million, Paul, for this year. You've heard us talk about growing it 3x the market. That 3x the market is around the fixed video and access control piece, which we still believe we can achieve. If you take the size of the video market, all-in, worldwide, and we always zero China out, given their indigenous competitors, this is about an $18 billion \u2013 $17 billion to $18 billion business, addressable market. It's actually the largest addressable market we have. So, I think there's room to run here with the assets we've accumulated along with the analytics that our team is developing and intelligent edge devices as well. Thank you, Paul. I would say this. I mean, in the command center software, Next Gen 911 is a new opportunity for us, and that's obviously a favorable trend. The other thing I'd say, in terms of decision cycles is command center software, historically has had some of the oldest legacy technology and workflow processes literally over several years, 10, 15 years plus. So, I actually think that the inflection point is COVID-induced in part that's accelerating decisions to the cloud. Traditionally state and local customers would prefer control, and they'd confer \u2013 they'd prefer on-prem. I actually think that this pandemic has been a positive accelerant to decision-making around command center software, particularly around cloud. I think this suite that Kelly and Andrew's team has built also can be an accelerant to decision-making because instead of trying to decide a forklift process and an all or nothing, you can get an anchor tenant module in place and then upgrade those modules for additional components along the suite. On land mobile radio, we literally have tens of thousands of different contracts that are at different lengths and the systems are in different ages. The pandemic and the civil unrest has been an accelerant to some older systems here in North America that needed to be upgraded to digital and with state-of-the-art encryption to protect the communities and the local law enforcement better. I think as Molloy and his team have built new devices, APX NEXT, in TETRA, the MPX600 that's just announced, those two represent events and opportunities for our customers to make decisions to refresh as well. Thank you. I think the headwinds we talked about when COVID hit us back in March were PCR and the industries that were affected by it and public safety LMR, quote-unquote, being pushed to the right. The push to the right largely around sales engagement and deployments, I don't think that's changed at all. That's still the primary reason for the push to the right. Although I will tell you, it performed \u2013 its public safety LMR performed better than our expectations in Q3, and we expect it to improve again in Q4, which informs our guide. And I think public safety LMR and PCR, as I referenced earlier, I think will both improve, which will primarily drive why we expect the product segment to return to growth next year. There's a lot of still budget sources that Molloy referenced, we've been the beneficiaries of The CARES Act as well, but that's what I would say. I think that our capital allocation framework is 50-30-20. 50% of the cash flow being available for either acquisitions or share repurchase. It's a fungible amount, depending upon the opportunities that are in front of us. 30% is dividend, and 20% is CapEx. So that framework, loosely, is that it's not meant to be a prescription, but it's a framework. We were active in buying back shares at these levels, as you've seen in Q3. We think these are attractive levels to buy the stock in Q3. And we'll evaluate opportunities as they come. We've done tuck-in acquisitions on the video side, on the software side. I think that in regards to acquisitions next year, it will be, in part, a reflection of what opportunities come our way. But that's the thinking around the deployment of capital at this point. Thanks, Josh."

            "name": "Jack Molloy",
            "content": "Sure. Hey, Keith, it's Jack. Good afternoon. Yes. So, we saw sequential improvement in terms of our ability to engaging customers and just to kind of give you the geographic around the world. First of all, in North America, in government, we've been able to engage in person with customers and we've seen that manifest in terms of increase in proposals and sequential increase in terms of our LMR business and as Kelly pointed out, command center and video. In Europe, it's important to point out 55% of our revenue in Europe is recurring revenue. But we are starting to see, we saw certainly in Q3, both in the enterprise market and government, the ability of our customers to actually come, and extend and meet us virtually. So, that's been an improvement. Asia-Pac, same thing. The one area of the world, where we're having essentially lockdown, continues to be lockdown and we've got very much diminished expectations is Latin America. But I would certainly say it's improved, been really proud of the resilience of the team in terms of use of videoconferencing and really trying to engage our customers and pull them along. We've been heavy in terms of virtual trade shows and demonstrations. And as I said in government; particularly, in public safety, we engage with our customers in person masked up, et cetera. And maybe, one other thing, Greg. Just historically as we look at PCR, new product introduction, even in challenging times, equates to growth, and we do have some product refresh on the slate for 2021 as well. No, Tim, I think it's just prioritization, prioritization, prioritization. As you've heard me mention before, we're not in the business of a nice to have, we're in the business of a need to have in terms of emergency response. So really, we continue to see our customers drive projects through. The other thing is, I think that sometimes losses, there's just a multitude of different funding sources. Greg talked about CARES Act, but there's also things like special purpose local option taxes, which are still getting passed. And so we remain highly engaged with our customers. We see great demand across the portfolio and government and as we know with what's happening in the world right now, security means a great deal to cities, to states, and I think to our federal government. So more to follow, but we're encouraged with what we see. Yes, the only thing I'd just piggyback onto Greg's comments there, the one issue that we've been challenged with is actually physical deployment of systems in the Middle East and Africa and in Latin America. So, we're completely impaired to go do anything, and that's really elongated our ability to recognize revenues in those theaters."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of this call over the internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investors. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference.\nTim Yocum: Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2020 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of Products & Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President of Software & Services. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join the Q&A. We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call we\u2019ll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I\u2019ll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before our CFO, Jason Winkler, takes us through our Q2 results and outlook. First, I'm proud of our focus and execution in the second quarter, as we dealt with the challenges from COVID-19. We achieved revenue and earnings per share above our expectations, generated $209 million of operating cash flow and continued to grow in our Video Security, Command Center Software and Services businesses. Additionally, we closed the acquisition of IndigoVision in earlier this week, announced the acquisition of Pelco, investments which further strengthen our position as a global leader in Video Security. Second, our Software and Services segment continues to perform well. During the quarter, the segment grew 5% and the expanded operating margins by 260 basis points. We also won several new multiyear software and services contracts, highlighted by $26 million Next-Gen 911 nine contract with the state of Utah. And finally, I'm inspired by how our employees across the business continue to find ways to engage with customers, to sell, deploy, and support their solutions. And while the COVID-19 environment remains fluid, I am encouraged by the customer activity we've seen, particularly over the past several weeks. Now, before turning it over to Jason, I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Gino Bonanotte for his 33 years of outstanding service at Motorola. One of Gino's many accomplishments was developing a world-class finance organization. And Jason is a great example of our strong bench, as well as our succession planning. Jason's operational finance experience across Motorola for almost 20 years and almost -- and most recently leadership of our largest segment, including Video Security, uniquely qualifies him as Gino's successor. I personally have worked closely with Jason for just under 10 years, and several of you may recall him from when he was in Investor Relations a few years back. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Q2 results included revenue of $1.6 billion, down 13% from a year ago, including $40 million of revenue from acquisitions and $30 million of currency headwinds. GAAP operating earnings of $218 million and operating margins of 13.5% compared to 18.8% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $359 million, down $85 million, and non-GAAP operating margins of 22.2%, down from 23.9% in the year ago quarter, due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment partially offset by higher sales and gross margins in Software and Services. GAAP earnings per share of $0.78 per share compared to $1.18 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.39 versus $169 last year, primarily due to lower sales in products, partially offset by higher sales and gross margins in Software and Services. OpEx in Q2 was $426 million, down $68 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary spend and incentives, partially offset by costs from acquisitions. Q2 effective tax rate was 23% compared to 24% in the prior year, a change driven primarily due to higher R&D tax credits in this year. Turning the cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $209 million compared with $251 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $155 million compared with $188 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in cash flow was primarily due to lower sales and net income, partially offset by improvements in working capital. For the first half, both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up year-over-year, primarily driven by an improved working capital. Capital allocation for Q2 included $109 million in cash dividends, $83 million of share repurchases, $65 million for acquisitions, and $54 million of CapEx. Additionally, we've repaid $500 million of the $800 million we borrowed in Q1 under the revolving credit facility, which was in response to COVID-19. $300 million of this was paid during Q2 and $200 million has been paid subsequent to the quarter-end, bringing the current outstanding amount to $300 million. Moving to our segment results. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $968 million, down 22% driven by a decline in professional and commercial radio and public safety LMR. The decline in the segment was primarily delayed sales engagement and deployments primarily caused by COVID-19. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $20 million and the currency headwinds were $10 million. Operating earnings were $131 million or 13.5% of sales, down 600 basis points from last year, primarily driven by lower sales. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in the segment included a $24 million P25 order for the state of Alaska, a $20 million P25 order for Newton County, Georgia and a $17 million P25 order for the state of South Dakota. We also launched the WatchGuard V300 continuous operation body worn camera, the first in the industry to address law enforcement's need for cameras that remain operational beyond a 12-hour shift. We closed on the acquisition of IndigoVision, and this week announced the Pelco transaction, both important assets as we expand our video security solutions. Moving to the Software and Services segment. Revenue was $650 million, up 5% from last year driven by growth in North America Services and Software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $20 million and currency headwinds were $20 million. Operating earnings were $228 million or 35.1% of sales, up 260 basis points from last year, driven by higher gross margins and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q2 wins in this segment include a $37 million P25 multiyear services contract with the state of Louisiana, a $10 million statewide multiyear services contract in North America, an $8 million multiyear computer aided dispatch contract with Baltimore County, and a $26 million Next-Gen 911 services contract with the state of Utah. Next-Gen 911 is a growing part of our business that provides enhanced database infrastructure, enabling multimedia content for 911 systems. Looking at regional results. North America Q2 revenue was $1.1 billion, down 13% due to declines in professional and commercial radio and public safety LMR, partially offset by growth in Video Security, Command Center Software and Services. International Q2 revenue was $525 million, down 14% primarily due to a decline in professional and commercial radio and unfavorable FX. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $10.5 billion, down $376 million compared to last year, inclusive of $126 million of unfavorable currency rates, driven further by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts and a few other international deployments, partially offset by growth in North America. Sequentially backlog was up $68 million, inclusive of $253 million of favorable currency rates. Software and Services backlog was down $148 million or 2% compared to last year, inclusive of $116 million of unfavorable currency rates, revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts and partially offset by growth in North America multiyear agreements. Sequentially backlog was up $161 million or 2%, inclusive of $225 million of favorable currency rates. Products and SI segment backlog was down $228 million or 7% compared to last year, inclusive of $10 million of unfavorable currency, due to large international deployments and COVID-19 delaying sales engagements. Sequentially backlog was down $93 million or 3%, inclusive of $27 million of favorable currency rates, driven primarily by COVID-19 delaying sales engagements. Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be down between 9% and 8%, with non-GAAP EPS between $1.72 and $1.78 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. For the full year, we expect sales to be down approximately 7%, with non-GAAP EPS between $7.40 and $7.52. This assumes approximately $30 million of FX headwinds at the current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22%. Additionally, we still expect to realize the $210 million of year-over-year OpEx reductions that we communicated on our last call. The acquisition of Pelco as an incremental $30 million of OpEx for the balance of the year, resulting in a net reduction of $180 million inclusive of Pelco. And for our operating cash flow, it is expected to be $1.5 billion for the year. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Jason. And let me just close with a few thoughts. First, our momentum is strong in Software and Services. In Command Center Software, we won numerous multiyear awards during the quarter, highlighted by our Next-Generation 911 order from the state of Utah. Additionally, we're seeing an increase in engagements for our cloud based solutions as more public safety agencies recognize the benefits that these solutions can provide. We launched our CAD and records products in the cloud during the second quarter and have sold it to a number of customers already. In our services business, the support we've provided to our LMR customers during the pandemic has further validated the criticality of private secure mission critical networks. We continue to see customers investing in these networks for the long-term. Second, in our Product segment where we clearly felt the impact from COVID-19 during Q2, as many of our customers experienced disruptions, I've been encouraged by the increase in activity we've seen particularly over the past several weeks with our customers. We are expecting improvement in the second half of the year, as economies open up and public safety customers, reengage. In our Video Security business, demand remains strong and we continue to expect growth for the year. We're investing in the portfolio to provide AI powered solutions with analytics that keep people and communities safe. And we've expanded our global footprint with the recent acquisitions of IndigoVision and Pelco. And finally, as I look to the second half of 2020, we expect business conditions to gradually improve from the low point in Q2. Our portfolio of solutions across LMR, video, and command center software, together with the services we provide, are as critical as ever. Engagements with our customers and the corresponding pipeline have increased sequentially. And our balance sheet and free cash flow generation remain strong, providing us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in the deployment of capital. I'll turn the call back over to Tim.\nTim Yocum: Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callars to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind callars on the line how to ask a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Tim Long of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Maybe -- I got one for you Greg, and then when we're done, I have a follow-up for Jason. Greg, you talked about some encouraging conversations recently, I would love to get more color there, particularly in the context of state and local government budgets and how you're seeing that? And what kind of impact do you see the rest of the year, and any more color that would be great. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Yeah. I think that things have gradually are improving. It's incremental, but from the low point, Tim, in April and May was tough as well. June is better in July, has performed within kind of the context of our expectations. I think that as customers reengage among other things, there's obviously heightened interest around video, particularly body worn video. There's interest in cloud and cloud engagement, given more and more people having to work from home and a few of our customers that are having public safety systems and major deployments. Some may not be fully encrypted. And given the congregation of large numbers of people in the cities, some of these customers have reached out in an effort to have us work with them to accelerate their public safety systems to encrypt them and be more secure. Those are three themes. I think the other thing I would say is we've done a pretty good job. I think the Lloyd's team has done a great job and Kelly's team on learning how to engage customers remotely and move some procurements along. I also think that the pipeline is beginning to see some gradual improvement, which is positive as well. And I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Jack.\nJack Molloy: Yeah. I think, you said Greg. State local, we're full on reengaged with customers face-to-face in North America, but maybe just a few stats to put meat on the bones. Our marketing call center inquiries in Q2 were up 15%, quotes for body worn were up close to 50% and in car and body worn requests for quotes were up over a 100%. So, just to kind of quantify some of the things that Greg spoke about.\nTim Long: Okay. That's great. Jason welcome since your first one, I'll throw one to you. Obviously, great performance in the margins on Software and Services. Could you talk a little bit about kind of sustainability and as that business scales, and there's more bundle sales and software and things like that. Is there still room for upside to that line? And what would drive that? Thank you.\nJason Winkler: Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Tim. First, we were pleased with the growth of 5% in the segment for the quarter, and it did drive higher gross margins complemented by lower operating expenses and leverage. So, I'm pleased with the performance there. I think the team led by Kelly continues to execute well. And we'll continue to expect growth from that business as well as continue to expect operating margins this year around 34%. \nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Greg, I just wanted to start -- appreciate you bringing out full year guidance. And it looks like on 2020 on the EBITDA line, it actually might shape up similar or maybe a little bit better than 2008, 2009. And I just wanted to challenge that embedded in guidance is a Q4 upswing. And I just have two questions around that. First, on the revenue line, it's going to imply improvement year-over-year in that line. What gave you the confidence to go that far out? A couple quarters out, you have something on from orders or aged backlog that gave you the visibility to stick your neck out for Q4. And then secondly, on the operating profit dollar line, it looks like operating profit dollars are going to be down less than revenue on a year-over-year basis. It plays a pretty big swing sequentially in Q4 on operating profit dollars. Why would that occur? Is there some cost cuts incremental or something like that that would make that operating profit dollar line inflect like that? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Yeah. So, first thing kind of let me contextualize the Q3 guide, obviously revenue down negative eight to negative nine, and then all-in, revenue down approximately 7% of for fiscal year 2020. Now, when I referenced second half improvement, I'm talking about improvement from the low point anchored in Q2, which was -- April was things pretty much seized up and May wasn't much better. So, the improvement is off of Q2, even contemplated in the guidance though. We're still -- while it's sequentially improving, we are not -- we don't anticipate growth in Q4 to get to the all-in negative 7% decline. So, we are not contemplating or anticipating Q4 standalone to return positively to growth. Although, we think it will sequentially improve from Q3. You referenced kind of second half of this year versus the fiscal crisis in 2009, I would say here are the differences that I think about between those two periods. In many regards, this is worse, because COVID-19 is a public health prices, which has been contributed to the second most difficult economic situation since 2009. And it's global. It's not a North American phenomenon or U.S. phenomenon, it's in 188 countries. That's the bad news. The good news is we're totally different company than we were in 2009. If we rewind the tape and think about what we were facing then, we still had -- we were in the cellphone business losing several hundred million a quarter. We were in the cellular wireless infrastructure business with single digit market share, sitting at number five or number six. And those businesses were structurally challenged. Today, we are in mission critical public safety networks. We're in, what I would call, kind of central nervous system 911 command center software. And we're in all things video, fixed video, body worn video, dash-cam video, license plate recognition. So the portfolio of the firm is much more critical needs to have, the nice to have, and obviously we've been impacted by COVID-19, but that disruption has been more about a disruption than a decline in overall demand. The long-term drivers still remain pretty sound. And even in this difficult year, we still expect to grow in command center software. We expect to grow in video security. We expect to grow in land mobile radio services. And when you look at the Software and Services segment -- and by the way, on the last call in May, I think I referenced Software and Services we thought could grow in the mid single digits. We now expect for full year 2020 Software and Services segment to grow more in the high single digits. The operating margin guidance of that segment we referenced last time was 33%. Jason just said a few minutes ago, we now expect all-in more like 34% operating margin for Software and Services. So, I certainly don't want to collectively put our neck out. I think, it's more reflection of the beginning progress we're seeing in the months of June and July. And the last thing I would throw in is aged backlog, which you referenced actually is up slightly, both for Q3 from this position heading into Q3 and for the second half. And those ingredients are what informs our perspective for the full year.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks, Greg.\nGreg Brown: Yeah. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from George Notter of Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nGeorge Notter: Hi. Thanks very much. I guess, I wanted to get back to the questions around public safety, LMR. There's a stimulus package obviously kind of potentially coming out of the U.S. House and Senate. And I guess, I'm just trying to think about how state and local governments are kind of parsing that. I mean, it may or may not include some backfill for budgets on state and local. If you think about your outlook over the second half of the year, I mean, are governments counting on any stimulus ? Or when you talk about the picture you have over the back half of the year, is it fair to say you're not expecting any stimulus as part of that picture? So, any help there would be great. Thanks.\nGreg Brown: Yeah. I think first, the guidance we're giving you today contemplates kind of the state of play as it is today. We talked about public safety engagement being pushed to the right a bit in our inability to get with customers face-to-face. It also impacted some deployments. But I would characterize that again as is more of a disruption than a decline in demand. Now, all-in, when we think about North America public safety, land mobile radio, all-in products and services, I think we contemplate approximately a decline of about 7% for North America public safety products and services all-in. So, that's kind of the way we think about it.\nJason Winkler: Yeah. And maybe to piggyback off that, George, as you well know, implied in our guidance, we look at deals on a really a ground up basis. So, there were funded. We feel like we've guided prudently. I will say that any -- and really the CARES money, so some of the phase two CARES money has started to flow to the state/local governments. In fact, we were receipt of an order from a state in the Southeast, $20 million order in the Southeast of P25 upgrade just in the last few weeks. So, we'll see some of that, but it's all implied in what we see in the second half of the year. In general, any additional monies may be beneficial. But what we see for the second half of the year is already funded. \nGeorge Notter: Great. Okay. Thank you very much.\nJason Winkler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi. Thank you for the question. Now that you've introduced your body worn camera, and also we've talked about the video opportunity a bit more broader on past calls, and as you integrated IndigoVision [ph] and WatchGuard, are you still expecting to grow at three times the video market rate, even with the introduction of a body worn camera, given the series of current events that have actually taken place in North America, do you still expect to go three times the market? \nJack Molloy: Yeah. Sami, hi. It's Jack. There's really two questions. We've talked about growing three times the market really in the context of our fixed video business. And we -- yes. The answer to that is yes. We believe, and we think that the external market share data validates the fact that we're growing three times the market there. We -- with our recent acquisitions of both IndigoVision and Pelco, we've added incremental scale, incremental geographic coverage. We've broadened our portfolio with [indiscernible] and explosion proof technology that further -- we've also added open channels of distribution that will bolster our North America business. So, I think we're even in a better spot as we were just three months ago to continue to grow. And I think three times is a good marker. As we pivot to body worn camera, we've had a body worn solution that came with the acquisition of WatchGuard. But I think right now, environmentally, the cost for more transparency in police in the U.S. -- by the way, in the U.S. and also abroad, we've got two deals in Europe, north of a million dollars here in the last few months for body worn cameras as well. Our pipeline is expanding. You heard my commentary around requests for quotes, both for body worn and for body and in car combination deals. We're seeing customers ask for accelerated deployments, and it really works out very well because in May, we announced our V300 new body worn camera. We think we've improved the quality. And just in the last two weeks, we've come out with a body worn camera is a service offering as well that the market had been asking for. So listen, we feel really good about where we stand with fix video with adding incremental brand and coverage. And then, we love what's -- our opportunities in body worn, and we think the market wants alternatives in the body worn camera space as well.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you for those details. And then, maybe a quick one on Pelco. I know you guys disclosed the revenue run rate and the fact that it's going to be EPS dilutive. But do you guys have a timeframe in mind that when it's going to be EPS neutral or creative? And what growth rate of revenue should we expect for that acquisition or that revenue run rate?\nGreg Brown: Yeah. So, as you pick up and we've talked about it being $55 million, maybe $60 million of contribution of top line this year, and slightly dilutive on EPS, approximately $0.03. So, as we get into next year, it will be dilutive again to a small amount. And then as -- the improvements to the business around growth, which we expect to execute into the 20 21 and beyond.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. \nBen Bollin: Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start -- I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you think about public sector budgets and whether you feel there could be any long tail impacts to those public safety revenue sources into future years or future periods, because of what you've seen in the last quarter or so from COVID? And specifically just any thoughts on income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes. And then I have a follow-up. \nJack Molloy: Sure. Ben, it\u2019s Jack. Maybe I'll take a stab at your -- the first part of your question. So, what we see with COVID has really been more around physical disruption of being able to meet with customers. I think we've done a good job in trying to make sure we had virtual connections with customers, integrations ability -- Kelly's team's ability to continue to service those customers. But as we talked about before -- and I think this is an important thing -- as it relates to the overall state of play with kind of call it policing budgets in the U.S., technology's actually a very small portion of that. Technology gives public safety leverage in the ability to be more efficient. So, actually as we think about our engagements with customers, our proposal flow pipeline and all those kinds of things, we've actually seen some of those things pick up. But the reality is no matter if -- no matter how something's funded, you're going to call 911, someone's going to have to be able to communicate. And I think we play a pretty prominent role there. The other thing is you think about funding, I think a lot of attention is paid to sales tax funding, which has been most acutely impacted through COVID, but there's a multitude of different funding sources that really play within funding technology in the public space. It's property taxes, which quite frankly may actually improve. If you look at some of the home pricing and those kinds of things. Federal grant transfer dollars, and just even looking at the CARES Act, just for the first two phases, we'll probably increase funding to the coffers of public safety. And the last thing and it's really important, because it's been part and parcel to a lot of our acquisitions is really around 911 funding. And so with all of this going on, and we read all the narrative in the media and the journal, New York Times and alike, just this Monday night, we had a deal in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that was approved the 911 -- they went to referendum. They call it a millage in the state of Michigan, went to vote, went to ballot to fund a P25 upgrade in Kalamazoo. And it was approved at a two-thirds to one-third by the public. And I think public will continue to make sure that they give the police fire, EMS officers, the best of breed technology. And quite frankly, despite all the narrative in the media, we haven't seen any kind of damage to our engagement and pipeline in the business.\nBen Bollin: That's really helpful. Thanks. The other -- plays into this a little bit. I wanted to touch on -- kind of how you grade yourself in the command center initiative, within the call center, dispatch records, just your thoughts on progress market share. And I know there's a player out there that's somewhat distressed the PE roll off. I'm curious if you feel like, there's still a lot of market share out there to grab, just how you see that market developing. Thanks.\nKelly Mark: Sure. I'll take that. This is Kelly, Ben. We're very pleased with the progress we're making in the command center. In fact, this quarter we announced our Records and our CAD products are now available in the cloud. We've had -- already had a number of sales and deployments that we're working on around that. We've announced a lot of new features associated with our 911 call taking, related to call transcriptions, some new features there. And what you've probably heard on the call was also that we also just got awarded a deal with the state of Utah NGCS. And NGCS I'll just remind you is -- it is our -- it's a new growing part of our software business that provides enhanced data infrastructure for 911 system. So they can handle text, voice, multimedia, and other video applications and things that might be sent as a 911 call centers. And the way I'd simply described that, if you think about our 911 call centers, that folks sit in and handle calls, they typically are using our VESTA call taking software. It's basically been what I would call a single lane road going into call centers right now -- in the single lane road handled voice calls. That's it. What we're now doing is building a multi-lane highway that goes into these call centers that provides them the opportunity, as I said, to handle multimedia, voice, text, and video. And Utah's a good example of that. And that's going to be a growing new piece of our software business, but we're very pleased. We're well landed with a lot of customers. We're continuing to see expansion in regards to sales and customers buying into the suite. And I think it's a great opportunity for us to take that install base that we have and continue to expand it with these new offerings that we're developing.\nGreg Brown: Yeah. The thing I would add too is I think Kelly and his whole team from an internal expectation standpoint, they meet or beat the financial targets that we give them inside the company. Andrew Sinclair and his team have done great -- a great job integrating the suite and getting operating efficiencies out of the point solutions and point acquisitions we made, referenced again this quarter 260 basis points expansion in operating margin. And while we do expect operating margins over time to continue to grow and we now expect that Software and Services segment to be approximately 34%, that also has to be weighted into -- we'll make commensurate investments along the way too. So, I think that the operating margin improvement in this segment, in total, will be a bit more measured. I don't think you can necessarily take the 500 some basis points done two quarters ago and 260 basis points this quarter and straight line it, it'll be a bit more measured. But I love the investment. I love the integration. We got a lot of outside technical talent largely based software skills out of Seattle and Salt Lake City. And I'm pleased with the progress being done all the way around that front.\nBen Bollin: Thanks everyone. I appreciate it.\nGreg Brown: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nPaul Coster: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if there's any significant shift in the mix of sales between infrastructure and devices. And within devices, any significance to the sort of the LTE based products. Is there a shift in favor of those at this time?\nJason Winkler: I think that -- yeah, there's been some mixed shifts where devices have been down in Q2 in a more pronounced way, but by the way, it's consistent to the expectations, Paul, that we had. I had mentioned I think in May our PCR device business, which professional and commercial radio, think about it as kind of non-public safety radio sold to enterprise. That's been acutely affected, because it's largely anchored in verticals like oil and gas, airline travel hospitality. So that's been the most pronounced decline. We still expect the PCR business to be down approximately 35% for the full year 2020. So that device decline has been more acute as we talked about. And there's been some device decline as well in public safety, given the COVID-19 disruptions, but all pretty much within the envelope of expectations. As it relates to LTE, nothing really new. LTE is a complimentary broadband network that compliments mission critical public safety and in the U.S. the P25 networks that are deployed. So, nothing -- no material change on that front.\nPaul Coster: One area of consensus coming out of Washington is the need to kind of beef up rural communications. And I'm just wondering, are you seeing any spillover effect from those infrastructure funds that are being deployed? \nJack Molloy: Paul, it's Jack. So, in public safety, we've got 43 state and provincial networks. I think out of the 47 that had been built, many of those are rural areas, so we've got good public safety coverage in rural America. And I think that's probably the biggest thing. We have continued to see by the way. There's also a couple of states that we deem rural that are looking at CARES funding to accelerate the acquisition of statewide upgrades. So, I think it's probably more generally CARES funding that they get directed to some of those rural states.\nPaul Coster: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Paul. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks. Greg, last quarter, I think, you said public sector video hit the $50 million revenue mark roughly one year after your first launched video into the public sector. I recognize there's going to be quarterly volatility, but I'm hoping you can give us an update on that number. And I guess the longer term question would be, if I remember correctly, you did $700 million video all-in in calendar 2019, almost all which by definition was from the commercial non-public sector market. And the thought arises, you just added Pelco over a hundred -- sounds like over $100 million annualize run rate. I think Indigo did $50 million last year, and that was growing at 12% and my understanding was -- is somewhat impaired at the time. So, you've just added $150 million of revenue on top of your video base. When you look out into calendar 2021, what do you see for the video progression? I assume the public sector, given that it's so early in that adoption, we should expect public sector and Feds video very aggressively with or without the police to funding moment. And that $50 million by the end of this year, it could be in the high tens, not a $100 million. I think about it too aggressively.\nGreg Brown: So Paul, if we dimensionalize the video security business all-in and you referenced a few assets, but if I think about Avigilon, IndigoVision and Pelco, and then VaaS and WatchGuard, given the organic development and the continued acquisitions, we're now approaching a $1 billion of annualized revenue. I think for this year, if I were to range, it I'd range it between $900 million and maybe $940 million of annualized video security revenue for us inside the company. So, it's consequential. It's more significant. It's against the backdrop of the largest addressable market we serve. Molloy talked about on the fixed video side our ability and our expectation to continue to grow three X the market now. Historically fixed video was growing at about -- we think about video security and access control about 5%, that may not grow as high as that. It may be low single digits as an overall market, but our goal is still quite clear to take market share in fixed video. And on body worn video, I think the market is excited about the prospect of a vibrant second competitor and alternative choice. So, a lot of good things going on there now. You referenced the video for IndigoVision and Pelco of previous periods, but again, it's also in the backdrop of COVID-19. So, you necessarily can't take a historical video number and extrapolate into 2021. I think it's fair to say we know that Pelco revenues will be less in 2020, both -- before they were owned by us and in the stub period annualized, Pelco revenue could be between $140 million and $150 million -- a $140 million and $150 million for 2020. And then our goal would be to stabilize that, use the global channel, use the second brand, use the international footprint, use the unique portfolio into the federal market that Pelco affords this.  There's a lot of interesting possibilities that company and that brand present to us as an owner that I don't think standalone they necessarily could gain on their own. We continue to make progress on the video side, on the government side. Maybe Jack can talk to that.\nJack Molloy: Yeah. So, Paul, just two things. I think Greg hit it pretty well. The first thing is, as we think about the government piece of it, that's education as well as public safety. And I think one thing I want to note that we're all exceptionally proud of is the team's agility and how quick they move to market when they were working from home to develop the COVID-19 dashboard. So, think about kids going back to school and the universities and in the K through 12 environment, we've developed software that can do occupancy counting within classrooms or the workplace, social distancing metrics, mass detections. Through use of our access control manager, we can do correlation reports [technical difficulty] to the workplace or to schools, that software will continue to help us in the -- not only in government, we believe in the enterprise space as well.\nPaul Silverstein: Hey, Greg and Jack, to my question about relative to the $50 million you did in the first quarter for public sector. Can you give us an update on that? \nGreg Brown: Yeah. I think we -- as much as Q3, obviously -- so I guess I'll answer it this way. We were impacted in April and May pretty severely. But we saw pickup. We grew -- in June -- we grew 7% in June. And we saw the government business pick up. In fact, we landed in other north of million dollar deal with a federal agency. Education business picked up again in June. Probably wasn't quite 50, but, directionally the business is still very strong. \nPaul Silverstein: All right. Greg, just a clarification on your PCR comment. If I recall, PCR was a $1 billion annual business for you. So when you saw about it being down 35%, I'm sorry -- about $350 million ballpark.\nJason Winkler: That's right. Approximately, yes.\nPaul Silverstein: All right. I'll pass it on. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nJason Winkler: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Trevor filling in for Keith. Could you talk about how canceled deals compared to delayed deals in the second quarter? And when would you expect the delayed deals to become realized?\nGreg Brown: Sure. Trevor, so to be candid, and I think I'd be aware of him because I'm forced by someone that'd be very detailed. And I said, no, I'm kidding. But we didn't have any deals that were canceled. What we've seen and I think you've probably heard this is, we did have delayed engagements on meeting. So, when we started analyzing pipeline in April and really the first two weeks of May, we saw some new deal creation that slowed. The other piece of it is from an integration standpoint. We saw the physical ability to access sites. And those access command centers as we were deploying command center software. We had some delays, but I would tell you equally, we've virtually deployed eight countywide networks in Q2. And the other piece of it that I think, that Kelly and his team has done an excellent job on is we actually have seen our -- the renewals for our management support service contracts in North America have not only been signed -- on-time signage, but actually upsold as well. So, I think that the services team did an excellent job on that. So nothing canceled. Some delays and pushed to the right, but we've seen renewals for our service management support agreements accelerate not only in size, but in terms of on-time signage as well.\nJack Molloy: Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to that is, if we take the regional lens through the business we talked about engagements improving incrementally in North America in June and July. If we look at the rest of the world, the international business, I would say that since May Latin America has stepped down, we expect that to be down now about $90 million for the full year, which is an incremental $60 million decline from May, but that's largely offset positively by the acquisition of Pelco, but that's the only other color I did. But no cancellations, delayed deals beginning, and again, beginning to get some traction, Kelly's on service renewals, customer renewals on-time, and in some cases, it increased value. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you and good evening. Earlier in the conference call, you pretty much alleviated the concerns about the funding of projects. You talked about the prioritization to first responders, which is believable and just fine. My question is as things are being bid on, are you being asked to give proposal on? And I don't want the answer to be both. Is it more command center or more like body worn camera or more security? I know you kind of talked about all of them, but when we get excited about the -- yeah, dimensionalizing the three.\nGreg Brown: It's a great question. If we take it from a revenue view and take the revenue opportunity around securing infrastructures that are unencrypted today, cloud and body worn, I think -- and I'll have Jack jumped in, I would say probably securing land mobile radio network opportunities with -- from an all-in revenue opportunity would be number one. And what would you say between body worn and cloud?\nJack Molloy: Body worn right now, and then followed -- from a revenue perspective, followed closely by cloud as well.\nGreg Brown: And also because the cloud opportunities that we would capture are largely as a service going forward. So, in terms of their revenue, significance annualized. It's less than the other two. But over the longer term, obviously, a cloud customer with an annuity based as a service is a very valuable financial customer.\nJim Suva: And then my follow on is, I know it's not a razor blade model. But I assume kind of once you get in with say, body worn cameras or something else you naturally are picking up and pitching the cross selling. Can you talk a little bit about that? Are you seeing a lot of success or any metrics of X percent of cross selling you've seen or anything like that we can be just be conscious of?\nJack Molloy: Yeah. So, one of the things we do and we're very conscious of when we make acquisitions and we continue to bring things into the public safety or the enterprise portfolio is really who's the decision makers and what's our capability to get in front of those customers. And do we have trust? Do we have influence with those customers? So, a lot of the success you've seen and we're seeing with body worn cameras and frankly, in the command center software space as well, our customers that really -- those relationships were founded upon. They've had long lasting relationships with our public safety P25 network. So, there's a lot of commonality and decision makers in public safety. And we've had good -- I think good success in terms of going and continuing to add and build on those trusted relationships. So, cross-sell is just part of the DNA. We ask our account managers. Jim, just to give you -- just to kind of, alliterate it, we have a three dimensional view of every account. And we look at every technology we bring to bear. And we essentially have a stop sign type chart to say where we are in the progress, who's our competition and all those kinds of things. So, that gives you a perspective, but that's how we make decisions on what to buy and then how we go approach customers.\nGreg Brown: Jim, I might just add on the cross-sell component. I think that we definitely -- from a sense when there's body worn, it feeds into our records platform on command -- in our command center. But we're still seeing a lot of traction with our customers in regards to them expanding into the suite. And certainly, there's a high level of cross-sell across whole aspects of our suite from the 911 call handling into the CAD products and into the Records products. And the integration that we provide underneath in regards to helping our customers manage that entirety of that workflow through its full complexity, not just body worn video and handling video, but handling everything that comes in to a customer from the 911 call, to all the way to what happens in an incident, all the way to the body worn video, all the way into jail records and court. Those are things that are critical to our customers and they look for a customer to give them an integrated view. So, they all work together as Jack referenced. And in particular, I'd just say in the command center side, it's incredibly important there on that cross-sell.\nTim Yocum: Next question.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Tim Yokum, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.\nTim Yocum: Yeah. Appreciate you listening in today and we look forward to talking to many of you soon. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. And a replay of this call will be available over the internet in approximately three hours. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Q2 results included revenue of $1.6 billion, down 13% from a year ago, including $40 million of revenue from acquisitions and $30 million of currency headwinds. GAAP operating earnings of $218 million and operating margins of 13.5% compared to 18.8% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $359 million, down $85 million, and non-GAAP operating margins of 22.2%, down from 23.9% in the year ago quarter, due to lower sales in the Products and SI segment partially offset by higher sales and gross margins in Software and Services. GAAP earnings per share of $0.78 per share compared to $1.18 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.39 versus $169 last year, primarily due to lower sales in products, partially offset by higher sales and gross margins in Software and Services. OpEx in Q2 was $426 million, down $68 million versus last year, primarily due to lower discretionary spend and incentives, partially offset by costs from acquisitions. Q2 effective tax rate was 23% compared to 24% in the prior year, a change driven primarily due to higher R&D tax credits in this year. Turning the cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $209 million compared with $251 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $155 million compared with $188 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in cash flow was primarily due to lower sales and net income, partially offset by improvements in working capital. For the first half, both operating cash flow and free cash flow were up year-over-year, primarily driven by an improved working capital. Capital allocation for Q2 included $109 million in cash dividends, $83 million of share repurchases, $65 million for acquisitions, and $54 million of CapEx. Additionally, we've repaid $500 million of the $800 million we borrowed in Q1 under the revolving credit facility, which was in response to COVID-19. $300 million of this was paid during Q2 and $200 million has been paid subsequent to the quarter-end, bringing the current outstanding amount to $300 million. Moving to our segment results. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $968 million, down 22% driven by a decline in professional and commercial radio and public safety LMR. The decline in the segment was primarily delayed sales engagement and deployments primarily caused by COVID-19. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $20 million and the currency headwinds were $10 million. Operating earnings were $131 million or 13.5% of sales, down 600 basis points from last year, primarily driven by lower sales. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in the segment included a $24 million P25 order for the state of Alaska, a $20 million P25 order for Newton County, Georgia and a $17 million P25 order for the state of South Dakota. We also launched the WatchGuard V300 continuous operation body worn camera, the first in the industry to address law enforcement's need for cameras that remain operational beyond a 12-hour shift. We closed on the acquisition of IndigoVision, and this week announced the Pelco transaction, both important assets as we expand our video security solutions. Moving to the Software and Services segment. Revenue was $650 million, up 5% from last year driven by growth in North America Services and Software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $20 million and currency headwinds were $20 million. Operating earnings were $228 million or 35.1% of sales, up 260 basis points from last year, driven by higher gross margins and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q2 wins in this segment include a $37 million P25 multiyear services contract with the state of Louisiana, a $10 million statewide multiyear services contract in North America, an $8 million multiyear computer aided dispatch contract with Baltimore County, and a $26 million Next-Gen 911 services contract with the state of Utah. Next-Gen 911 is a growing part of our business that provides enhanced database infrastructure, enabling multimedia content for 911 systems. Looking at regional results. North America Q2 revenue was $1.1 billion, down 13% due to declines in professional and commercial radio and public safety LMR, partially offset by growth in Video Security, Command Center Software and Services. International Q2 revenue was $525 million, down 14% primarily due to a decline in professional and commercial radio and unfavorable FX. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $10.5 billion, down $376 million compared to last year, inclusive of $126 million of unfavorable currency rates, driven further by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts and a few other international deployments, partially offset by growth in North America. Sequentially backlog was up $68 million, inclusive of $253 million of favorable currency rates. Software and Services backlog was down $148 million or 2% compared to last year, inclusive of $116 million of unfavorable currency rates, revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts and partially offset by growth in North America multiyear agreements. Sequentially backlog was up $161 million or 2%, inclusive of $225 million of favorable currency rates. Products and SI segment backlog was down $228 million or 7% compared to last year, inclusive of $10 million of unfavorable currency, due to large international deployments and COVID-19 delaying sales engagements. Sequentially backlog was down $93 million or 3%, inclusive of $27 million of favorable currency rates, driven primarily by COVID-19 delaying sales engagements. Turning to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be down between 9% and 8%, with non-GAAP EPS between $1.72 and $1.78 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. For the full year, we expect sales to be down approximately 7%, with non-GAAP EPS between $7.40 and $7.52. This assumes approximately $30 million of FX headwinds at the current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22%. Additionally, we still expect to realize the $210 million of year-over-year OpEx reductions that we communicated on our last call. The acquisition of Pelco as an incremental $30 million of OpEx for the balance of the year, resulting in a net reduction of $180 million inclusive of Pelco. And for our operating cash flow, it is expected to be $1.5 billion for the year. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Tim. First, we were pleased with the growth of 5% in the segment for the quarter, and it did drive higher gross margins complemented by lower operating expenses and leverage. So, I'm pleased with the performance there. I think the team led by Kelly continues to execute well. And we'll continue to expect growth from that business as well as continue to expect operating margins this year around 34%. Yeah. And maybe to piggyback off that, George, as you well know, implied in our guidance, we look at deals on a really a ground up basis. So, there were funded. We feel like we've guided prudently. I will say that any -- and really the CARES money, so some of the phase two CARES money has started to flow to the state/local governments. In fact, we were receipt of an order from a state in the Southeast, $20 million order in the Southeast of P25 upgrade just in the last few weeks. So, we'll see some of that, but it's all implied in what we see in the second half of the year. In general, any additional monies may be beneficial. But what we see for the second half of the year is already funded. Thank you. I think that -- yeah, there's been some mixed shifts where devices have been down in Q2 in a more pronounced way, but by the way, it's consistent to the expectations, Paul, that we had. I had mentioned I think in May our PCR device business, which professional and commercial radio, think about it as kind of non-public safety radio sold to enterprise. That's been acutely affected, because it's largely anchored in verticals like oil and gas, airline travel hospitality. So that's been the most pronounced decline. We still expect the PCR business to be down approximately 35% for the full year 2020. So that device decline has been more acute as we talked about. And there's been some device decline as well in public safety, given the COVID-19 disruptions, but all pretty much within the envelope of expectations. As it relates to LTE, nothing really new. LTE is a complimentary broadband network that compliments mission critical public safety and in the U.S. the P25 networks that are deployed. So, nothing -- no material change on that front. That's right. Approximately, yes. Thank you."

            "name": "Kelly Mark",
            "content": "Sure. I'll take that. This is Kelly, Ben. We're very pleased with the progress we're making in the command center. In fact, this quarter we announced our Records and our CAD products are now available in the cloud. We've had -- already had a number of sales and deployments that we're working on around that. We've announced a lot of new features associated with our 911 call taking, related to call transcriptions, some new features there. And what you've probably heard on the call was also that we also just got awarded a deal with the state of Utah NGCS. And NGCS I'll just remind you is -- it is our -- it's a new growing part of our software business that provides enhanced data infrastructure for 911 system. So they can handle text, voice, multimedia, and other video applications and things that might be sent as a 911 call centers. And the way I'd simply described that, if you think about our 911 call centers, that folks sit in and handle calls, they typically are using our VESTA call taking software. It's basically been what I would call a single lane road going into call centers right now -- in the single lane road handled voice calls. That's it. What we're now doing is building a multi-lane highway that goes into these call centers that provides them the opportunity, as I said, to handle multimedia, voice, text, and video. And Utah's a good example of that. And that's going to be a growing new piece of our software business, but we're very pleased. We're well landed with a lot of customers. We're continuing to see expansion in regards to sales and customers buying into the suite. And I think it's a great opportunity for us to take that install base that we have and continue to expand it with these new offerings that we're developing."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before our CFO, Jason Winkler, takes us through our Q2 results and outlook. First, I'm proud of our focus and execution in the second quarter, as we dealt with the challenges from COVID-19. We achieved revenue and earnings per share above our expectations, generated $209 million of operating cash flow and continued to grow in our Video Security, Command Center Software and Services businesses. Additionally, we closed the acquisition of IndigoVision in earlier this week, announced the acquisition of Pelco, investments which further strengthen our position as a global leader in Video Security. Second, our Software and Services segment continues to perform well. During the quarter, the segment grew 5% and the expanded operating margins by 260 basis points. We also won several new multiyear software and services contracts, highlighted by $26 million Next-Gen 911 nine contract with the state of Utah. And finally, I'm inspired by how our employees across the business continue to find ways to engage with customers, to sell, deploy, and support their solutions. And while the COVID-19 environment remains fluid, I am encouraged by the customer activity we've seen, particularly over the past several weeks. Now, before turning it over to Jason, I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank Gino Bonanotte for his 33 years of outstanding service at Motorola. One of Gino's many accomplishments was developing a world-class finance organization. And Jason is a great example of our strong bench, as well as our succession planning. Jason's operational finance experience across Motorola for almost 20 years and almost -- and most recently leadership of our largest segment, including Video Security, uniquely qualifies him as Gino's successor. I personally have worked closely with Jason for just under 10 years, and several of you may recall him from when he was in Investor Relations a few years back. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thanks, Jason. And let me just close with a few thoughts. First, our momentum is strong in Software and Services. In Command Center Software, we won numerous multiyear awards during the quarter, highlighted by our Next-Generation 911 order from the state of Utah. Additionally, we're seeing an increase in engagements for our cloud based solutions as more public safety agencies recognize the benefits that these solutions can provide. We launched our CAD and records products in the cloud during the second quarter and have sold it to a number of customers already. In our services business, the support we've provided to our LMR customers during the pandemic has further validated the criticality of private secure mission critical networks. We continue to see customers investing in these networks for the long-term. Second, in our Product segment where we clearly felt the impact from COVID-19 during Q2, as many of our customers experienced disruptions, I've been encouraged by the increase in activity we've seen particularly over the past several weeks with our customers. We are expecting improvement in the second half of the year, as economies open up and public safety customers, reengage. In our Video Security business, demand remains strong and we continue to expect growth for the year. We're investing in the portfolio to provide AI powered solutions with analytics that keep people and communities safe. And we've expanded our global footprint with the recent acquisitions of IndigoVision and Pelco. And finally, as I look to the second half of 2020, we expect business conditions to gradually improve from the low point in Q2. Our portfolio of solutions across LMR, video, and command center software, together with the services we provide, are as critical as ever. Engagements with our customers and the corresponding pipeline have increased sequentially. And our balance sheet and free cash flow generation remain strong, providing us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in the deployment of capital. I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Yeah. I think that things have gradually are improving. It's incremental, but from the low point, Tim, in April and May was tough as well. June is better in July, has performed within kind of the context of our expectations. I think that as customers reengage among other things, there's obviously heightened interest around video, particularly body worn video. There's interest in cloud and cloud engagement, given more and more people having to work from home and a few of our customers that are having public safety systems and major deployments. Some may not be fully encrypted. And given the congregation of large numbers of people in the cities, some of these customers have reached out in an effort to have us work with them to accelerate their public safety systems to encrypt them and be more secure. Those are three themes. I think the other thing I would say is we've done a pretty good job. I think the Lloyd's team has done a great job and Kelly's team on learning how to engage customers remotely and move some procurements along. I also think that the pipeline is beginning to see some gradual improvement, which is positive as well. And I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Jack. Yeah. So, first thing kind of let me contextualize the Q3 guide, obviously revenue down negative eight to negative nine, and then all-in, revenue down approximately 7% of for fiscal year 2020. Now, when I referenced second half improvement, I'm talking about improvement from the low point anchored in Q2, which was -- April was things pretty much seized up and May wasn't much better. So, the improvement is off of Q2, even contemplated in the guidance though. We're still -- while it's sequentially improving, we are not -- we don't anticipate growth in Q4 to get to the all-in negative 7% decline. So, we are not contemplating or anticipating Q4 standalone to return positively to growth. Although, we think it will sequentially improve from Q3. You referenced kind of second half of this year versus the fiscal crisis in 2009, I would say here are the differences that I think about between those two periods. In many regards, this is worse, because COVID-19 is a public health prices, which has been contributed to the second most difficult economic situation since 2009. And it's global. It's not a North American phenomenon or U.S. phenomenon, it's in 188 countries. That's the bad news. The good news is we're totally different company than we were in 2009. If we rewind the tape and think about what we were facing then, we still had -- we were in the cellphone business losing several hundred million a quarter. We were in the cellular wireless infrastructure business with single digit market share, sitting at number five or number six. And those businesses were structurally challenged. Today, we are in mission critical public safety networks. We're in, what I would call, kind of central nervous system 911 command center software. And we're in all things video, fixed video, body worn video, dash-cam video, license plate recognition. So the portfolio of the firm is much more critical needs to have, the nice to have, and obviously we've been impacted by COVID-19, but that disruption has been more about a disruption than a decline in overall demand. The long-term drivers still remain pretty sound. And even in this difficult year, we still expect to grow in command center software. We expect to grow in video security. We expect to grow in land mobile radio services. And when you look at the Software and Services segment -- and by the way, on the last call in May, I think I referenced Software and Services we thought could grow in the mid single digits. We now expect for full year 2020 Software and Services segment to grow more in the high single digits. The operating margin guidance of that segment we referenced last time was 33%. Jason just said a few minutes ago, we now expect all-in more like 34% operating margin for Software and Services. So, I certainly don't want to collectively put our neck out. I think, it's more reflection of the beginning progress we're seeing in the months of June and July. And the last thing I would throw in is aged backlog, which you referenced actually is up slightly, both for Q3 from this position heading into Q3 and for the second half. And those ingredients are what informs our perspective for the full year. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. I think first, the guidance we're giving you today contemplates kind of the state of play as it is today. We talked about public safety engagement being pushed to the right a bit in our inability to get with customers face-to-face. It also impacted some deployments. But I would characterize that again as is more of a disruption than a decline in demand. Now, all-in, when we think about North America public safety, land mobile radio, all-in products and services, I think we contemplate approximately a decline of about 7% for North America public safety products and services all-in. So, that's kind of the way we think about it. Yeah. So, as you pick up and we've talked about it being $55 million, maybe $60 million of contribution of top line this year, and slightly dilutive on EPS, approximately $0.03. So, as we get into next year, it will be dilutive again to a small amount. And then as -- the improvements to the business around growth, which we expect to execute into the 20 21 and beyond. Yeah. The thing I would add too is I think Kelly and his whole team from an internal expectation standpoint, they meet or beat the financial targets that we give them inside the company. Andrew Sinclair and his team have done great -- a great job integrating the suite and getting operating efficiencies out of the point solutions and point acquisitions we made, referenced again this quarter 260 basis points expansion in operating margin. And while we do expect operating margins over time to continue to grow and we now expect that Software and Services segment to be approximately 34%, that also has to be weighted into -- we'll make commensurate investments along the way too. So, I think that the operating margin improvement in this segment, in total, will be a bit more measured. I don't think you can necessarily take the 500 some basis points done two quarters ago and 260 basis points this quarter and straight line it, it'll be a bit more measured. But I love the investment. I love the integration. We got a lot of outside technical talent largely based software skills out of Seattle and Salt Lake City. And I'm pleased with the progress being done all the way around that front. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, Paul. So Paul, if we dimensionalize the video security business all-in and you referenced a few assets, but if I think about Avigilon, IndigoVision and Pelco, and then VaaS and WatchGuard, given the organic development and the continued acquisitions, we're now approaching a $1 billion of annualized revenue. I think for this year, if I were to range, it I'd range it between $900 million and maybe $940 million of annualized video security revenue for us inside the company. So, it's consequential. It's more significant. It's against the backdrop of the largest addressable market we serve. Molloy talked about on the fixed video side our ability and our expectation to continue to grow three X the market now. Historically fixed video was growing at about -- we think about video security and access control about 5%, that may not grow as high as that. It may be low single digits as an overall market, but our goal is still quite clear to take market share in fixed video. And on body worn video, I think the market is excited about the prospect of a vibrant second competitor and alternative choice. So, a lot of good things going on there now. You referenced the video for IndigoVision and Pelco of previous periods, but again, it's also in the backdrop of COVID-19. So, you necessarily can't take a historical video number and extrapolate into 2021. I think it's fair to say we know that Pelco revenues will be less in 2020, both -- before they were owned by us and in the stub period annualized, Pelco revenue could be between $140 million and $150 million -- a $140 million and $150 million for 2020. And then our goal would be to stabilize that, use the global channel, use the second brand, use the international footprint, use the unique portfolio into the federal market that Pelco affords this.  There's a lot of interesting possibilities that company and that brand present to us as an owner that I don't think standalone they necessarily could gain on their own. We continue to make progress on the video side, on the government side. Maybe Jack can talk to that. Yeah. I think we -- as much as Q3, obviously -- so I guess I'll answer it this way. We were impacted in April and May pretty severely. But we saw pickup. We grew -- in June -- we grew 7% in June. And we saw the government business pick up. In fact, we landed in other north of million dollar deal with a federal agency. Education business picked up again in June. Probably wasn't quite 50, but, directionally the business is still very strong. Sure. Trevor, so to be candid, and I think I'd be aware of him because I'm forced by someone that'd be very detailed. And I said, no, I'm kidding. But we didn't have any deals that were canceled. What we've seen and I think you've probably heard this is, we did have delayed engagements on meeting. So, when we started analyzing pipeline in April and really the first two weeks of May, we saw some new deal creation that slowed. The other piece of it is from an integration standpoint. We saw the physical ability to access sites. And those access command centers as we were deploying command center software. We had some delays, but I would tell you equally, we've virtually deployed eight countywide networks in Q2. And the other piece of it that I think, that Kelly and his team has done an excellent job on is we actually have seen our -- the renewals for our management support service contracts in North America have not only been signed -- on-time signage, but actually upsold as well. So, I think that the services team did an excellent job on that. So nothing canceled. Some delays and pushed to the right, but we've seen renewals for our service management support agreements accelerate not only in size, but in terms of on-time signage as well. It's a great question. If we take it from a revenue view and take the revenue opportunity around securing infrastructures that are unencrypted today, cloud and body worn, I think -- and I'll have Jack jumped in, I would say probably securing land mobile radio network opportunities with -- from an all-in revenue opportunity would be number one. And what would you say between body worn and cloud? And also because the cloud opportunities that we would capture are largely as a service going forward. So, in terms of their revenue, significance annualized. It's less than the other two. But over the longer term, obviously, a cloud customer with an annuity based as a service is a very valuable financial customer. Jim, I might just add on the cross-sell component. I think that we definitely -- from a sense when there's body worn, it feeds into our records platform on command -- in our command center. But we're still seeing a lot of traction with our customers in regards to them expanding into the suite. And certainly, there's a high level of cross-sell across whole aspects of our suite from the 911 call handling into the CAD products and into the Records products. And the integration that we provide underneath in regards to helping our customers manage that entirety of that workflow through its full complexity, not just body worn video and handling video, but handling everything that comes in to a customer from the 911 call, to all the way to what happens in an incident, all the way to the body worn video, all the way into jail records and court. Those are things that are critical to our customers and they look for a customer to give them an integrated view. So, they all work together as Jack referenced. And in particular, I'd just say in the command center side, it's incredibly important there on that cross-sell."

            "content": "Yeah. I think, you said Greg. State local, we're full on reengaged with customers face-to-face in North America, but maybe just a few stats to put meat on the bones. Our marketing call center inquiries in Q2 were up 15%, quotes for body worn were up close to 50% and in car and body worn requests for quotes were up over a 100%. So, just to kind of quantify some of the things that Greg spoke about. Yeah. Sami, hi. It's Jack. There's really two questions. We've talked about growing three times the market really in the context of our fixed video business. And we -- yes. The answer to that is yes. We believe, and we think that the external market share data validates the fact that we're growing three times the market there. We -- with our recent acquisitions of both IndigoVision and Pelco, we've added incremental scale, incremental geographic coverage. We've broadened our portfolio with [indiscernible] and explosion proof technology that further -- we've also added open channels of distribution that will bolster our North America business. So, I think we're even in a better spot as we were just three months ago to continue to grow. And I think three times is a good marker. As we pivot to body worn camera, we've had a body worn solution that came with the acquisition of WatchGuard. But I think right now, environmentally, the cost for more transparency in police in the U.S. -- by the way, in the U.S. and also abroad, we've got two deals in Europe, north of a million dollars here in the last few months for body worn cameras as well. Our pipeline is expanding. You heard my commentary around requests for quotes, both for body worn and for body and in car combination deals. We're seeing customers ask for accelerated deployments, and it really works out very well because in May, we announced our V300 new body worn camera. We think we've improved the quality. And just in the last two weeks, we've come out with a body worn camera is a service offering as well that the market had been asking for. So listen, we feel really good about where we stand with fix video with adding incremental brand and coverage. And then, we love what's -- our opportunities in body worn, and we think the market wants alternatives in the body worn camera space as well. Sure. Ben, it's Jack. Maybe I'll take a stab at your -- the first part of your question. So, what we see with COVID has really been more around physical disruption of being able to meet with customers. I think we've done a good job in trying to make sure we had virtual connections with customers, integrations ability -- Kelly's team's ability to continue to service those customers. But as we talked about before -- and I think this is an important thing -- as it relates to the overall state of play with kind of call it policing budgets in the U.S., technology's actually a very small portion of that. Technology gives public safety leverage in the ability to be more efficient. So, actually as we think about our engagements with customers, our proposal flow pipeline and all those kinds of things, we've actually seen some of those things pick up. But the reality is no matter if -- no matter how something's funded, you're going to call 911, someone's going to have to be able to communicate. And I think we play a pretty prominent role there. The other thing is you think about funding, I think a lot of attention is paid to sales tax funding, which has been most acutely impacted through COVID, but there's a multitude of different funding sources that really play within funding technology in the public space. It's property taxes, which quite frankly may actually improve. If you look at some of the home pricing and those kinds of things. Federal grant transfer dollars, and just even looking at the CARES Act, just for the first two phases, we'll probably increase funding to the coffers of public safety. And the last thing and it's really important, because it's been part and parcel to a lot of our acquisitions is really around 911 funding. And so with all of this going on, and we read all the narrative in the media and the journal, New York Times and alike, just this Monday night, we had a deal in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that was approved the 911 -- they went to referendum. They call it a millage in the state of Michigan, went to vote, went to ballot to fund a P25 upgrade in Kalamazoo. And it was approved at a two-thirds to one-third by the public. And I think public will continue to make sure that they give the police fire, EMS officers, the best of breed technology. And quite frankly, despite all the narrative in the media, we haven't seen any kind of damage to our engagement and pipeline in the business. Paul, it's Jack. So, in public safety, we've got 43 state and provincial networks. I think out of the 47 that had been built, many of those are rural areas, so we've got good public safety coverage in rural America. And I think that's probably the biggest thing. We have continued to see by the way. There's also a couple of states that we deem rural that are looking at CARES funding to accelerate the acquisition of statewide upgrades. So, I think it's probably more generally CARES funding that they get directed to some of those rural states. Yeah. So, Paul, just two things. I think Greg hit it pretty well. The first thing is, as we think about the government piece of it, that's education as well as public safety. And I think one thing I want to note that we're all exceptionally proud of is the team's agility and how quick they move to market when they were working from home to develop the COVID-19 dashboard. So, think about kids going back to school and the universities and in the K through 12 environment, we've developed software that can do occupancy counting within classrooms or the workplace, social distancing metrics, mass detections. Through use of our access control manager, we can do correlation reports [technical difficulty] to the workplace or to schools, that software will continue to help us in the -- not only in government, we believe in the enterprise space as well. Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to that is, if we take the regional lens through the business we talked about engagements improving incrementally in North America in June and July. If we look at the rest of the world, the international business, I would say that since May Latin America has stepped down, we expect that to be down now about $90 million for the full year, which is an incremental $60 million decline from May, but that's largely offset positively by the acquisition of Pelco, but that's the only other color I did. But no cancellations, delayed deals beginning, and again, beginning to get some traction, Kelly's on service renewals, customer renewals on-time, and in some cases, it increased value. Body worn right now, and then followed -- from a revenue perspective, followed closely by cloud as well. Yeah. So, one of the things we do and we're very conscious of when we make acquisitions and we continue to bring things into the public safety or the enterprise portfolio is really who's the decision makers and what's our capability to get in front of those customers. And do we have trust? Do we have influence with those customers? So, a lot of the success you've seen and we're seeing with body worn cameras and frankly, in the command center software space as well, our customers that really -- those relationships were founded upon. They've had long lasting relationships with our public safety P25 network. So, there's a lot of commonality and decision makers in public safety. And we've had good -- I think good success in terms of going and continuing to add and build on those trusted relationships. So, cross-sell is just part of the DNA. We ask our account managers. Jim, just to give you -- just to kind of, alliterate it, we have a three dimensional view of every account. And we look at every technology we bring to bear. And we essentially have a stop sign type chart to say where we are in the progress, who's our competition and all those kinds of things. So, that gives you a perspective, but that's how we make decisions on what to buy and then how we go approach customers."

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTim Yocum: Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2020 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of Products & Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President of Software & Services. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join the Q&A. We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call we\u2019ll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks Time. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I\u2019ll start off by sharing a few thoughts on the business before Gino takes us through our Q1 results and second quarter outlook. First, I'd like to start by thanking our more than 17,000 people around the world for their resilience, adaptability and unwavering commitment to our customers. We made the decision in mid-March to have the vast majority of our workforce do their jobs remotely and they've successfully and smoothly transitioned to their new environments. Those who needed to work on-site have shown a fearless dedication to our customers, leaving the safety of their homes to ensure that our mission critical operation centers and customer sites remain reliable and always on. I\u2019d also like to say that we're deeply thankful for the actions of the public safety and healthcare professionals that are keeping us and our community safe, and we're acutely aware of our responsibility to them during these unprecedented times. Because of this, our employees have gone to great lengths to continue to support them and I could not be more proud of their efforts. Second, despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19 we grew earnings per share by 16% during the quarter, expanded operating margins by 200 basis points and generated $308 million of operating cash flow, an increase of 23% versus the prior year. Additionally, we continue to see strong demand for our Video Security Solutions, highlighted by a $28 million order from a large utility in North America, the single largest order in the history of the Avigilon business, and our Software & Services segment grew sales by 13% and expanded operating margins by 520 basis points. And finally, while the COVID-19 pandemic has confirmed the fundamental need for our mission critical solutions, it's also brought uncertainties surrounding its severity, impact and duration. So as a result we made the decision to withdraw our full year guidance at this time. We'll reassess this decision at the end of the second quarter based on the information and clarity we have at that time. And with that, I'll now turn the call over Gino to provide additional details on Q1 and our second quarter outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts.\nGino Bonanotte: Thank you, Greg. Q1 includes revenue of $1.7 billion, flat versus a year ago, including $48 million of revenue from acquisitions and $7 million of currency headwind. GAAP operating earnings of $259 million is up $30 million and operating margin of 15.6% of sales compared to 13.8% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $347 million up $32 million or 10% and non GAAP operating margins of 21% of sales, up 200 basis points from 19%, driven by higher gross margin. GAAP earnings per share of $1.12 compared to $0.86 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.49 up 16% from $1.28 last year on higher operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. OpEx in Q1 was $451 million, down $15 million versus last year, primarily due to lower incentives and lower legal expenses, partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q1 effect of tax rate was 15% compared to 20% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher excess tax benefits and share based compensation. Turning to cash flow, Q1 operating cash flow was $308 million compared with $251 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $260 million compared with $185 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in cash flow was primarily due to improved working capital. Capital allocation for the quarter included $253 million of share repurchases, $109 million in cash dividends, $48 million of CapEx and $36 million for acquisition. Additionally, out of an abundance of caution, we made the decision to draw down $800 million from our revolving credit facility. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and have an additional $1.4 billion of committed undrawn capacity remaining on the revolver. We've also taken numerous actions over the past several years to restructure our debt maturity profile and de-risk our pension liability. As a result, we have no debt maturities in 2020 or 2021 absent the revolver and no expected pension contribution until 2023. The strong liquidity position and balance sheet provides us with the capital deployment flexibility for acquisition opportunity in the future. Moving to segment results, Q1 products and systems integration sales were $993 million, down $76 million or 7% driven by a decline in Professional and Commercial Radio, partially offset by strong growth in Video Security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $24 million and currency headwinds were $5 million. Operating earnings were $123 million or 12.4% of sales, down 140 basis points from last year due to the lower revenue. Notable Q1 wins in the segment include a $28 million Video Security award for a large utility customer in North America, of which $10 million was recognized as revenue in Q1; over $50 million of sales into governments across the entire Video Security portfolio, a $13 million P25 order for Port of Los Angeles California; a $12 million P25 order for Dinwiddie County, Virginia and an $8 million TETRA order for Germany's Armed Forces. Moving to Software & Services, revenue was $662 million up $74 million or 13% from last year, driven by growth in Command Center Software & Services. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $24 million and currency headwinds were $2 million. Operating earnings were $224 million or 33.8% of sales, up 520 basis points from last year, driven by higher gross margins and improved operating leverage. Notable Q1s in the segment include an $8 million P25 multi-year service contract extension with Cleveland, Ohio; a $6 million P25 multi-year services contract in Latin America; a $4 million Command Center Software suite contract with Brampton, Ontario; and a $3 million Command Center Software suite contract with Ft. Wayne, Indiana. Looking at regional results, during the quarter we restructured our operations to realize more operational efficiencies combining EMEA, Asia Pac and Latin America into one region, which is now reflected as the International. Accordingly, we now report net sales in two regions; North America, which includes the United States and Canada, and International. North America Q1 revenue was $1.1 billion, up 4% driven by growth in Video Security, Command Center Software & Services, partially offset by a decline in professional and commercial radio. International Q1 revenue was $539 million, down 7% due to a decline in Professional and Commercial Radio, primarily in Asia Pac. Moving to backlog, ending backlog was $10.4 billion, up $48 million compared to last year, inclusive of $462 million of unfavorable currency rates. Sequentially backlog was down $821 million due to $407 million of unfavorable currency rate, revenue recognition of the Airwave and ESN contract and typical North America order seasonality. Software & Services backlog was up $120 million or 2% compared to last year due to growth in North America multi-year agreements, partially offset by $423 million of unfavorable currency rates. Sequentially backlog was down $604 million, primarily due to $368 million of unfavorable currency rate and revenue recognition for ESN and Airwave. Product and SI segment backlog was down $72 million or 2% compared to last year, inclusive of $39 million of unfavorable currency rate. A decline in international backlog was partially offset by growth in North America. Sequentially backlog was down $217 million, driven primarily by typical North America order seasonality. Turning to our outlook, we expect Q2 sales to be down between 17% and 14%, with non-GAAP EPS between $1.18 and $1.27. This assumes approximately $30 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately $175 million shares, and an effective tax rate of between 24% and 25%. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Greg.\nGreg Brown : Thanks Gino. I thought I would end with a few high level comments regarding the full year impact COVID-19 is having on our business and how we're responding. First, while this pandemic has disrupted and delayed our engagements with some customers and will have an impact on certain parts of our business, we remain fully committed to continue investing in our growth businesses. In Command Center Software we are accelerating our development to move to the cloud and recently launched our first cloud enabled CAD customer. We also expect our records in CAD solutions to be fully cloud enabled by the end of this year with our 911 software to follow in 2021. In the Video Security business I'm very pleased with the continued traction with our enterprise and government customers, and will continue to invest in our H5 camera line, analytics, cloud based VMS solutions and features that integrate video and land mobile radio, while also expanding our sales coverage. Additionally, our durable cash flow generation and strong balance sheet put us in a unique position to be opportunistic with respect to acquisitions going forward. Second, while this is a critical time to continue to invest, we're also taking actions in a number of other areas to reduce our operating expenses. We now expect operating expenses to be down approximately $210 million versus 2019, which is a $150 million more than the annual decrease we discussed on our last earnings call. This additional reduction driven by lower to variable compensation, lower discretionary spend in areas such as travel and contractors and third party expenses and a reduction in real-estate should allow us to slightly expand operating margins for this year. And finally, Motorola Solutions has been providing mission critical solutions to customers on the front line for over 90 years, and have managed through a number of crises, and I couldn't be more proud of how our people have responded to this one. Whether it's our Airwaves team enabling network coverage for temporary hospitals being built in the U.K. or our team helping the customer move their 911 command center operations to a back-up location in days, where one of their employees tested positive for COVID, our teams are going to great lengths to make sure our customers mission critical needs are met. We entered this pandemic in a very secure position and I absolutely believe that we\u2019ll emerge an even stronger company on the other side of it. And now, let me turn this call back over to Tim.\nTim Yocum: Thank you, Greg. Before I begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question.\nOperator: Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long : Thank you. Yeah, maybe just for the two of them. First \u2013 maybe the quick one first. When thinking about kind of the whole in revenues in Q2 versus kind of what was probably originally expected, Gino can you help pass out how much of that is TCR related and how much is public safety? And then Greg, if you could just talk a little bit about the public safety market. It seems like overall the company's being impacted more than prior, you know macro events in the world. So could you talk a little bit about what's different? What do you think is driving the change to the public safety market other than just logistics? Do you see any other fundamental changes here given the macro backdrop? Thank you.\nGino Bonanotte : Hi Jim, this is Gino. On the first part of the question, clearly we've seen pressure in Professional and Commercial Radio. Certain verticals have been significantly impacted. You can think about hospitality, transportation, specifically airlines, oil and gas, manufacturing related to the pandemic and the shutdown for shelter-in-place orders. We have seen some impact to public safety as our engagements have been delayed, both in terms of site work, but also in terms of being able to talk to customers. Obviously our customers are on the front lines of dealing with a pandemic and there's certainly been a delay in that engagement and the ability to talk to our customers really frankly beginning in mid-March, lasting through April and certainly in larger markets through May. And it\u2019s also important to note that embedded in that guidance, we continue to expect Command Center and Video Security \u2013 Command Center Software and Video Security to grow in Q2. But that dimensionally, PCR, certain verticals very much impacted, public safety characterized as a move to the right, based on as you said, logistics and inability to get in front of people and get to sites.\nGreg Brown: Yeah, and Tim I would add that even though things have been pushed to the right, you know we're a different company now than we were several years ago. The good news is, you know we still expect Software & Services to grow this year. It could grow mid-single digits, we'll see, but we still expect that to grow. We do expect Video Security to grow, Command Center Software as part of Software & Services and I actually think \u2013 look, I think the severity of Q2 isn't so much as things have changed in public safety. I actually don't think they have. I think they've been pushed. Two or three weeks in March we effectively became locked down in major locations domestically here in the states. That lockdown has continued in May, as well as April. So I think when you look at Q2 and see the sharpness of that decline, it's really things pushing to the right than any structural or behavioral patterns to the changing in public safety. What we do is still a need-to-do versus a nice-to-do, but obviously the situation is pretty extensive given that it\u2019s a combination of a public health crisis, as well as a dramatic economic decline in 180-plus countries all at once. So hence I think our prudent approach at this point in time. I think the product segment for the full year will be down as things push to the right. It could be down low double digits; again, we'll have to see. But I think with resilient backlog and an overall strength of our position with 75% -- about 75% of our business is public safety and government and 25% enterprise, I still think we're well positioned.\nTim Long : Thank you, Greg.\nGreg Brown: Yeah, sure Tim.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nAdam Tindle: Okay thanks, good afternoon. Greg, I just wanted to start, kind of going back to the last financial crisis. I know that the business is different, but if you look at the like-to-like basis, during that time revenue for the full year was down somewhere around the mid-single digit range. Do you remember what it was on kind of a max-thing on a quarterly basis? Is there any similarity to sort of the mid-teen decline that you\u2019re seeing in Q2. And also, maybe how quickly did it recover and what could be similar or different this time around versus that?\nGreg Brown: Yeah, I think the difference is again in \u2013 unlike last time where we had the financial Great Recession and things recovered, what we've experienced here is a little bit like the market seizing up, literally. We couldn't get in front of customers, many customers on the sales side from an engagement standpoint and even on services and implementations, deployments, we are pushed out as well. I think we're much better position this time. Software & Services is a little bit more than a third of our business, most of that largely recurring long term contracts, mission critical in nature. If I rewind the tape last time, that was 20% or sub 20% of our overall revenue. The other thing is, even though we\u2019re having a difficult Q2, and Jack could comment on this, but we're seeing the funnel. Even though projects get pushed to the right, we've actually just over the last few weeks and months seen a constant replenishment of projects coming in too. So we just thought given the fog and uncertainty and the uniqueness of this thing, in a once and literally a century pandemic. It was kind of prudent for us to suspend full year guidance at this time. But I think we are much better positioned. I think we still expect growth in video, we still expect growth in Command Center Software. The professional and commercial radio business, which is think of the radio business for commercial, has been hit hard serving verticals like hospitality, transportation, airline, gaming and some of the things that have been hit particularly hard. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything.\nJack Molloy : Yeah, maybe just a couple of things. As we look around the globe, things are starting to open up in certain countries in Asia Pac who was frankly hit first. So there's potentially some signs of encouragement there in terms of reengaging with customers, customers focus moving back to technology projects. The second thing that I think that all of us feel pretty proud of is the team, their ability to continuously staying engage virtually with the customers by way of video, conference mechanisms, but also we held a video, a virtual trade show for our Video Security and Analytics Business, because an industry was canceled in March and we actually had \u2013 we had over 30% more people that actually attended our virtual conference than would have attended the conference in person, and literally had chat rooms, questions and everything from access control, school safety, and so we're encouraged by a lot of those things. We actually even see here into April, certain states engagements starting to improve and so it\u2019s just one of things. Obviously the pandemic has taken the focus of our customers and we'll continue to work with them in any way we can to support them.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, that's helpful. Maybe just as a follow-up. In your commentary on COVID-19 impact, you talked about delayed engagement, deployments with state local customers near term, which may impact future revenue, and maybe Greg and Jack can provide some color on that statement? More specifically, they are finding that customers are now evaluating other options because there is a fear that, \u2018hey, you know we\u2019ve long been worried about the potential cannibalization of LTE and broadband.\u2019 Is that a way to save money? Are customers evaluating that in a bigger way and is this kind of the catalyst to finally see that shift happen in a bigger way.\nGreg Brown: No, I don't think; in fact we see the opposite of that. During this time we see the importance and criticality of land, mobile, radio versus any alleged migration or shift to LTE. I think LTE is complementary; it's a data broadband network that's an extension of LMR. Actually our APX NEXT product that integrates broadband with land, mobile, radio is best positioned to take advantage of that. I know that there's been some speculation or commentary that suggests that LTE is starting to cannibalize. We see no \u2013 absolutely no indication of that, and if anything maybe the opposite. So, just maybe one thing to add to that. Obviously we see that we have an LTE, a public safety LTE device in the LEX11, but more importantly as Greg said, we have a collaborative device in terms of APX NEXT; it does P25 obviously. And the focus here is and what we\u2019ve seen in the pandemic and the response with public safety is fundamental when someone calls 911, there is a multitude of things that happened, but that puts our technology in place, and there\u2019s been more strain on the networks, which really is evidence to the fact of why you need a purpose built network? But a really good example was a major \u2013 without getting into specifics, a major city health department, procured APX NEXT devices because they needed to talk to the front line fire and EMS people, but also wanted that backup capability when they left the city and it was a big health department. There was really traditionally a secondary type customer for Motorola that bought obviously high tier equipment in terms of APX NEXT. So this thing has really been \u2013 a lot of what we're seeing in Q2 has really been the ability to not get to physical sites, to not engage physically with customers and I think that's really the challenge and we view that as being kind of a short term challenge.\nAdam Tindle: Understood. Thanks for the color. Stay safe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Notter : Hi guys, thanks very much. I guess just as a follow-on to that thought, you know you mentioned it's an issue around customer engagement, but what about budgets? Obviously states are going through budgeting cycles at this point. I think certainly tax receipts are going to be down, municipalities and counties you know a similar situation. So do you see sort of an economic kind of fall out of lower tax receipts or do you think the LMR businesses is more immune to that? Thanks.\nJack Molloy: So hey George, it\u2019s Jack. A couple things. I think it's always important \u2013 we see there's been a lot written, a lot discussed around state and local budgets. I think it's very important to decompose what those budgets mean. The reality of state and local budgets, there's a confluence of probably five to six different funding streams: federal transfer dollars, federal grant dollars, property tax, income tax, sales tax in some states, but also 911 funding, which is one of the real reasons why we've made a lot of acquisitions in the command center space, because part and parcel, that's a different funding streams that\u2019s essentially protected. So it's a number of those things, but I go back to \u2013 you know one of the benefits we have of being a company that's close to 95 years old is we've gone through a number of these things after 911 and they're all a little different, the Great Recession. But what we've seen and when we've gone back and looked at the data, it suggests that public safety gets prioritized in these things. There's other things around the margins that may get delayed, may get deferred, all those kind of things, but at the end of the day when \u2013 we've even seen it as evidence in this response to the pandemic, you need to have the best technology in the hands of those first responders. We think that gets protected. There's always \u2013 by the way the budget situations in state and local haven't been easy for the last number of years. I think that's lastly where our sales team, as much as they have relationships and everything, we\u2019ve got a very veteran team out there that's very focused at working with our customers to navigate funding plans and they are really holistic plans that they work with our customer base. So I think we\u2019ll come out of this with the same level of priority that public safety has always gotten, if not more George, so I think that answers your question.\nGeorge Notter : Got it, great! And then I'll just ask one more. The NG9-1-1 opportunity seems more interesting these days. I mean there's obviously a stimulus package that\u2019s brewing here coming from Congress administration, and I know in pass drafts there's been I think $12 billion plus in funds that were earmarked for NG9-1-1 upgrades and I'm not sure what this current package is going to look like. But does that \u2013 do you see that as an opportunity for Motorola Solutions and how much of that, you know those dollars you think could trickle down to the stuff that you guys do?\nKelly Mark: Hey George, it's Kelly. Absolutely, we do see that as an opportunity for us, not just in the in NG9-1-1, which is a refresh of the backbone associated with the 911 call center to help turn it into more of a broadband backbone, but it's also \u2013 there's been a lot of interest and related to cloud as a result of this pandemic, where a lot of our customers in the past have been operating with their equipment on an on-prem basis where they operate it there. The need to be able to operate it remotely is something that's definitely been introduced as part of this pandemic. The good news is we've already been investing in cloud and a good portion of our software was already cloud enabled. But as you heard Greg mention in our remarks, we're accelerating our investments even more in cloud based on the demand we see now. We just launched our first CAD customer in the cloud. By the end of this year our CAD, our records portfolio will be completely cloud enabled and in early next year we\u2019ll be \u2013 our 911 efforts will all be cloud enabled as well. So it does definitely drive that and yes, we do see some of those dollars starting to flow through as folks prioritize not just NG9-1-1, but the rest of the command center software refresh.\nGeorge Notter : Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Inaudible] filling in for Keith. L3Harris\u2019s CEO recently said that LMR sales could decline by 10% this year. Do you agree with that market assessment?\nGreg Brown: Well, I think that \u2013 I think our view is reflected in the commentary that we gave. They are a much smaller player in the business. I think we have much more extensive installed base and contacts and annuity revenues, but as I mentioned, you know Q2 is very unique, because as Malloy pointed out, just that this year\u2019s logistical difficulty of customer engagement and deployment. But do I think product revenues are likely to decline? Yes, and I think they will be on a decline that will be comparable to what we saw in the land, mobile, radio business actually in \u201809. But again, that's more about delayed and deferred demand, than any demand that's actually lost or goes away and I think it will recover and I think public safety is demonstrated over the last several years and longer. It remains at the top of the food chain. So I think they have a certain view of the market, that's their opinion, but I would maintain that I think we have a very long standing and more thorough and comprehensive perspective.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great! Thank you very much.\nA - Gino Bonanotte: Just one additional item on that note. It's also important to note the composition of the business and as Greg mentioned earlier, the percentage of our business that's commercially, that\u2019s earmarked for commercial customers. The PCR business specifically and that's where we're seeing the pressure more specifically is around PCR, not around necessarily the public safety to the degree that we're seeing in the PCR marketplace.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks, I appreciate it. Can you all hear me okay?\nA - Greg Brown: Yeah, yeah.\nPaul Silverstein: Okay. If I return to the PCR business, I know you don't normally break it out. Given that you've got a business with particular exposure, I\u2019d assume particularly heavy exposure to those sectors that have been absolutely devastated; hospitality, energy, etcetera, the ones you listed. Can you give us a sense for what percentage of revenue comes from those particular sectors?\nGreg Brown: Yeah, Paul the professional and commercial radio last year, again as Gino referenced, I think land, mobile, radio for commercial and enterprise, last year all in with about $1 billion. So as we think about it this year, obviously that's the area that's come under the most pressure, and two-thirds of that is vertical served; airlines, retail, hospitality, oil and gas that had been the most significantly impacted. So that's what's driving the more pronounced double digit decline in that area.\nPaul Silverstein: Given the nature of [inaudible], that's exactly what I would've expected, somewhere well north of 50%, so it's around two-thirds. Second question, with respect to your comments about Asia Pac in particular, I recognize its not been uniform in Asia Pac; at least I don\u2019t see it\u2019s been uniform in terms of the timing of the impact of COVID and the shutdown. But it hit China first and now we\u2019re seeing Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, etcetera. So my question is, is there any insight you can gain in terms of seeing the sequencing, in terms of things having gone cold turkey and coming back. I know it's very, very early. There's not a lot of visibility I trust anywhere, but is there anything you can take away from that timing and sequencing of events and just as it relates to your North American business and your worldwide business?\nA - Greg Brown: Yeah, so Paul I think when you look at Asia Pac, to your point it\u2019s essentially pretty sporadic. Things within country, you can't get in there from out, but our biggest country in Asia Pac is Australia. Things are \u2013 I'd say they're slightly ahead of where certain states that have started to re-open are here, with a lot of the same precautions and measures that have been set up. It's just really early to kind of tell to be honest with you. But I will tell you, you know one of the things that we look at is our \u2013 you know we haven't really talked about it, but our video security and analytics business, in the states that have opened up, we've seen engagement even within North America improve there. So it's \u2013 there's not a whole lot we can glean. You look at parts of the Middle East to buy, those places are starting to open up a little bit as well, but it's what I would call very cautious opening up.\nPaul Silverstein: I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nBen Bollin: Good evening everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to begin \u2013 could you start by discussing a little bit about how you think of your sales cycle duration as you reengage customers. You think there's any change in the kind of the traditional period of those awards? Just any high level thoughts on you know where you think customers had their outage, you're starting to have those discussions and your ability to close new business, and I have a follow up.\nGreg Brown: Okay Ben, so I dimensionalize our business. It's not \u2013 all things are not the same. There's big projects and then there's an amount of what you call kind of term agreement and grass roots business, that by the way has continued to an extent to continue to flow. Large projects typically go through \u2013 you get a request for proposal and that's a timeline, but then you have elements where they have to go through board approval, city council approvals, state procurement approvals and the like to use that example and really what Gino and what Greg have referenced, is a lot of those meetings have been delayed. So there's not an issue that we have to go resell, re-canvas if you will. It's really just the procedural milestones have moved to the right, whereby we've had to kind of reshuffle the milestones have moved to the right, whereby we've had to kind of reshuffle the milestones of a project and just extend them out you know into the second half and those kind of things. That's been the issue, it hasn't ended. The good news is, with video technology and those kind of things, we've been able to stay engaged with our customers, answer questions and all those kind of things, but it's really just a milestone type thing where we\u2019ve seen the delays. And as we\u2019ve talked about you know the physical access to get not only at sites, but in the Command Center and those kind of things as well. If we've got to go do work with those people there, there's been some delays as it relates to those things as well.\nBen Bollin: Thanks for that. Jack, you also earlier commented on the diversity in the funding sources. Outside of the 911 funding, when you look at the federal transfer tax, federal grants, property and income taxes, just stepping back, I mean those four pieces don't seem to be in a very good position looking forward. So I'm not looking for guidance, but I'm interested in how you're thinking about the absolute budget opportunity coming from the public sector customers into the future; just that aggregate bucket of opportunity. How you're thinking that developed over time or any specific feedback you're getting from customers? Thank you.\nJack Molloy: Yes, so I'd start with \u2013 listen, if we were selling and I don't want to \u2013 if we were selling something that that they would deem is non-critical, non-essential to their work flow communications, I'd maybe be a little bit concerned. But I think the fact that you're selling mission critical communications, you are at the very top of the priority chain, that's a good thing. But it's interesting. If you look at it, a lot of our customers feel like property taxes, you know a lot of these things. If there is a recovery gets a little bit sharper, they may not have the impact that we had. Obviously there's been a pretty significant impact as it relates to sales tax, but remember, most of our things are things that they've been planned for multiple years, their technology upgrades, expansions and those kind of things related to mission critical and we\u2019ve kind of went through this before, went through this a little bit after 911; certainly felt this. You know I was pretty close to the customer back in 2009 and navigated a team in the central United States that was probably hit frankly from a budget perspective harder than everybody and we saw some things delayed. We had some additional questions to answer, but every deal that we had at that point in time continued to move forward and I think I look at that as encouraging as we move through this pandemic.\nBen Bollin: Thanks guys. Best of luck in Q2 and the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPaul Coster: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. The sequential decline that you're looking for from a geographic perspective, is it sort of uniform across geographies?\nGino Bonanotte : Yeah, so Paul I think it is. If you look at it, because of the broad spread nature when we do business, Greg has said it hit 180 countries; there\u2019s 120 of those that we do business. In general if you look at it on the surface, it's essentially had an equal weighting and I think the reason for that is because it hasn't \u2013 the opportunities have just gone away. It's been that we've had some of the same limits, physically engaging with customers, going to sites and physically deploying systems and those kind of things. There has been essentially equal opportunity, delays as it's related to those things. So I'd say in general, it's been felt largely equally around the globe.\nPaul Coster: Just want to go back to the sort of budget contention question for a moment. It seems to me from a public safety perspective, things have shifted dramatically and they are going to be around for a while now, and the biggest shift of courses is towards testing and then administration of public health systems and that's going to be data intensive. And it just seems like that's where the dollars are going to be going in the future, but you feel like that doesn't contend with your budgets. If you could just comment upon that. And then in passing, also does the opportunity present itself to Motorola as well. I mean can you, participate in what seems like a very big initiative over the next couple of years.\nGreg Brown: So, Paul it's a great question, and one that frankly has us. If there's a lot of things that we \u2013 this has been certainly a struggle in the last couple of months for most companies, but it really delights us in the fact that we've added substantially in terms of the Video Security and Analytics portfolio to the company. Right now our teams are working on and will be \u2013 in May and June will be continuing to market Video Analytics Solutions around social distancing, around mask compliance and detection in campuses, in manufacturing facilities, in the public domain, fever scanning technology, as well as contact tracing. So analytics that will essentially tell you if you think about a lot of the dialogue around getting return to campuses, returned-to-schools and the like. Our access control solutions will be able to monitor and tell you if somebody was sick, who went through that door at that school, who might likely have come in contact with someone who is sick. So as much as we'll see, maybe a change or a moderation of a different type of opportunities. Our Video Security and Analytic space put a spot on in that. I also think the move in Kelly and his team have done a great job, moving the Command Center to the cloud, but if you look at our vigilant cloud services business, this has been I think \u2013 we\u2019ve moved 35,000 cameras to the cloud so far this year. So I think with every challenge comes an opportunity and the Video Security Analytics Business is one that I think has an opportunity to benefit from this.\nPaul Coster: You don\u2019t see the contention that I talked about. I mean I see the opportunity for you, but not \u2013 but you are not even seeing the contention for scarce resources there, the tension between public safety as expressed though healthcare versus public safety through LMR first responder systems.\nGreg Brown: If you talk to a paramedic, a police officer or a firemen, they tell you the most important piece of equipment that they have, that they've always had and this is a millennial firemen or it\u2019s a fireman's who has been on the job for 30 years, the single most important communication and the lifeline that they have is a two way radio. We don't see that changing. Our customers are telling us they don't see that changing.\nPaul Coster: Got it, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Please go ahead.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. I assume that the next quarter's guidance basically just assumes that the current state of affairs extends until the end of June, you're not expecting any recovery. Just kind of the thought process on that, because obviously you\u2019ve had some states opening up, you had some Airlines talking about seeing increased bookings, you had competitive companies talk about return to growth, Verizon talked about \u2013 while consumer was down, some of their larger enterprise or public safety clients were stronger than ever. So I\u2019m just curious about kind of what the guidance for Q2 implies and how far to the right I guess you could realistically think it can be, given some of these data point already exist now and in early May.\nGreg Brown: Yeah, I think that well, it largely reflects and is driven by as Gino mentioned, the professional and commercial radio segment itself. So radio for corporate verticals, that's the most accentuated pressure point on Q2. The second is the engagement and deployment, and again, it was the second half of March, April and largely a lot of May as well, and we just thought if we're going to guide Q2, let\u2019s do it in a responsible prudent way and move forward accordingly. But that, it's really\u2026\nWalter Piecyk: So it\u2019s just the PCR that you're involved with, because the PCR that other companies are involved with, I'm not sure I\u2019ve seen that type of dramatic move. So is it just that when you talk about airlines and things like that, that\u2019s it\u2019s just these specific things, because your products are addressing customers that are dealing with large crowds, that it's more specific to you guys as a result. And then, I guess it's hard for any of us to figure out when those types of businesses are going to come back if at all right. I mean some of these customers theoretically could just go away right.\nGreg Brown: Yeah. Well, maybe if I could. So the PCR if you think about it, I think you talked about Verizon. The traditional PCR, if you think about it from a competitive set, it's companies like Kenwood, like Hytera, ICOM, a number of the those type of people, and so I think they've \u2013 without a doubt they felt the same thing. And again, those are private systems dedicated towards a refinery, an airline, The Marriott Hotel and those kind of things, and I think that industry has equally felt it, because there\u2019s a physical element of design and deployment of a system as well. Verizon's a lot different. You could go and pick up at a kiosk, you could have a phone delivered and you can pick it up. So I wouldn't see the same sort of physical \u2013 you know the delay if you will that we would see in our business, so I think that's really what\u2026 [Cross Talk].\nWalter Piecyk: Yeah, I was referring only to Verizon. I mean, Ericsson, Axon, Ciena, CommScope, Adtran, I mean there\u2019s \u2013 obviously there's more than just Verizon at the data point. But it seems like some of these customers you just mentioned like airlines and some of these, again customers that rely a large crowds, it might be more specific, right. So again, are you worried that maybe those customers don't push to the right, but they just never kind of return at all because of the state of how people are going to return to large crowd as opposed to not?\nGreg Brown: I think it would be a small portion of it. I mean you know the example is, if an airline goes out of business, well that's one airline that won't need a radio system. But as we look at it, it's relatively \u2013 we view that to be a relatively small subset of the customers, frankly.\nWalter Piecyk: Okay, but it's enough that it's driving the revenue down not much in Q2. Because I thought you said the public safety was doing well, and it was just that \u2013 it was this segment that was doing poorly and that was enough to take guidance down by 15 \u2013 excuse me, your revenue growth down by 15%.\nGino Bonanotte : Yeah well, I think what we're trying to say is that Q2 is a timing issue, not an evaporation issue. And its acute negative 14 to negative 17, but it's not evaporating. It's going to the right and there might be some that evaporates, but we think it's a pretty small percentage. It\u2019s really representative of things being pushed to the right in that Professional Commercial Radio category.\nWalter Piecyk: Awesome! So if I see like \u2013 for example if JetBlue sees their numbers and we see those numbers go up, and Marriott, we see their numbers go up, they should be indicated that that business could then come back next quarter, not June quarter but the September, is that fair?\nGreg Brown: Walt, that\u2019s exactly right, and look, I can't speak to the exact timing of quarterly alignment. I don't know if we\u2019re that precise, but you are right that as airlines recover, people start to fly again, people go to Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, the states and the economies and commerce reopen, because does that business and the acute pressure downward start to improve, yes it will improve.\nWalter Piecyk: Got it. Thanks Greg, that\u2019s helpful.\nGreg Brown: Yeah, no problem Walt. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva : Thank you, Greg and you know I've known you for over a decade of time and we\u2019ve both been through a lot of cycles. You correctly talked about you know so much of the puts and takes. My question, since a lot of the questions already have been answered is more on the top of the ladder so to speak or when you talk about Motorola Solutions will give its fair piece of the pie or even bigger than its fair piece of pie. Is that pie for top of the ladder currently structurally compressed or compressed for like maybe six to 12 months, you know just due to less inflows of you mentioned five to six inflows of state and local budgets. I\u2019m more focused on the state and local budget balancing opportunities and what your experience has been in that? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Well, I think what I would say is this. Obviously this is a situation that I don't think any of us have seen before. We've had 9/11; we've had dot-com collapse; we've had the Lehman Brothers Great Recession. This one is different and that it's 187 countries and it's a compilation of both the public health crisis and an act of severe economic downturn at once and they're intertwined. So if I take a step back and think about, are we in the right businesses? Do we have brand equity? Do we have strength in incumbency? Do we have a greater percentage of recurring revenues in software and services? And I look at Command Center Software that will continue to grow, we believe it should grow this year even in the face of this. Video security and analytics, we expect to grow even in the face of this. Software and services, we would expect and still could grow around mid-single digits even in the face of this, and the incumbent footprint and strength that we have in our installed base of 13,000 land, mobile, radio networks worldwide, with probably our strongest anchor tenant position being North America. Is that a good business to be in? We absolutely believe that. We\u2019ll monetize services, we\u2019ll move upstream, by the way we\u2019ll integrate these as well. We\u2019ll integrate video security with integrated land, mobile, radio networks as an anchor tenant conveyor of communications and critical information in this addressable market, and we zero out China, forget China. It is a $40 billion addressable market. Is it temporarily dislocated? Obviously the answer is yes, and that's reflected in the Q2 guide. We always guide. I've never in my career not guided for a full year, this is the first. We just think it was a prudent thing to do. There's a lot of variables and things that are moving around, but it doesn't change the fundamental strength, attributes, longevity and advantages that our brand and our market position and the technologies we play, we can capitalize on, which is also why we are going to continue to invest organically. Sales coverage, video security, command center software to the cloud, hearing a different \u2013 and newer radios that you'll see later this year and next year and we're going to continue to invest inorganically, and I think this is an opportunity to prioritize capital deployment around acquisitions of assets that they're having temporary dislocation, that may make sense for us accretively to fold into Motorola Solutions. So there's no doubt it's a tough environment, but I really believe and I think our team does too, that this is an opportunity to invest and lean in responsibly, take down the breakeven and take out $210 million of OpEx and position the firm even stronger to come out of the other end in 2021 and beyond, and that's exactly what we're going to do.\nJim Suva : Great! And my quick follow up is, other companies are kind of called off M&A, simply because you can't meet in person, you can't walk their floors and factories. It sounds like from your comment you just gave me now that M&A is actually very, very interesting to you and you're still going to go forward as planned. Is that correct or it maybe you go forward as planned and it just takes a little bit longer.\nGreg Brown: I would say it's going forward. It may take a little bit longer, but there's a couple of opportunities the we're engaged with now, and that dialogue has begun, we'll see. Most of them don't pan out, but I don't see and right now Jim, as we\u2019re in the middle of May, this is another area that I feel is kind of reopening if you will. I don't see conversations in this regard being encumbered that will delay any plans or opportunities that come our way.\nJim Suva : Thank you, so much for the detail. It\u2019s greatly appreciated.\nGreg Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSami Badri: Hi! Thank you very much for the question. My question mainly has to with Avigilon and the video surveillance business, and you've guided to a slight growth or some growth in 2020 for video, but I was hoping you\u2019ll tell us what video and what Avigilon grew in 1Q, 2020 and where really we should be thinking about the growth rate, just because the growth rate is coming from the mid-teens growth rates in 2019 and we just want to get a better sense on how to model that for 2020.\nJack Molloy: So obviously Q2 as Greg, Gino, as we pointed out, there's been some limitations in terms of just ability to meet and some of those no customer engagements, you know that's been the issue for Q2. But I would tell you Sami, looking at Q1, where we were coming out of the end of March in Q1, it was the best quarter we've had with Avigilon. Frankly we had talked about growing three times the market. We're taking more share. Particularly in North America the team has done an outstanding job. We've made significant investments in go-to-market, even greater investments in research and development. I spoke to some of the interesting things we are working on and pandemic response earlier. We\u2019ve got a completely new line of H5 cameras, software analytic investments we've made, that's not even to include what we've invested in in public safety and WatchGuard, the acquisition of WatchGuard and VaaS and we\u2019re doing there. So we actually \u2013 we expect the businesses, assuming return to normal, sometime in the third quarter, we expect to get back to those growth rate levels if not greater.\nSami Badri: Got it, got it. And then I just had a follow-up on Command Center, and there was a big uptick that you guys have called out. You\u2019ve addressed it and a big thing, and you are pointing the growth for the full year. The one thing I really wanted to know is, when it comes to the Command Center suite, do you have existing customers buying more modules within the Command Center? Is that what the big uptick was or is it just those customers that needed the Command Center suite in the first place and then they just happened to execute that in 1Q, 2020, and you're going to see more new customers come in for the rest of the year versus the existing customers buying in more modules. I just want to understand kind of like what the motion is within Command Center?\nKelly Mark : So Sami, its Kelly. It's a combination of both. Actually in the first quarter we actually picked up a number of new customers. Frankly more new customers than suite customers, which is great, because that gives us the opportunity to land and expand those customers and grow the platform in the width and the depth of what we provide to them. We are still seeing also though many of our customers are still moving and we are expanding and adding more modules of the Command Center Suite. As you probably recall, as I\u2019ve said the past, folks don\u2019t walk in and buy typically all the components at one time, simply because of the risk profile of a Command Center and a 911 Center. They will schedule and they will do 911 one year, CAD the next year, Record the next year, and the thing that we watch is how we're doing regards to penetrating across those positions and we are still seeing good progress on that. So I don\u2019t know if you have a follow-up on that, but that's pretty much how we look at the Command Center, that\u2019s the performance and why we saw the growth we did in Q1.\nSami Badri: Perfect! Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over Tim Yocum for any closing remarks.\nTim Yocum: No additional comments. Thanks for joining today and we\u2019ll talk to a lot of you soon.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Gino Bonanotte",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Q1 includes revenue of $1.7 billion, flat versus a year ago, including $48 million of revenue from acquisitions and $7 million of currency headwind. GAAP operating earnings of $259 million is up $30 million and operating margin of 15.6% of sales compared to 13.8% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $347 million up $32 million or 10% and non GAAP operating margins of 21% of sales, up 200 basis points from 19%, driven by higher gross margin. GAAP earnings per share of $1.12 compared to $0.86 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.49 up 16% from $1.28 last year on higher operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. OpEx in Q1 was $451 million, down $15 million versus last year, primarily due to lower incentives and lower legal expenses, partially offset by costs related to acquisitions. The Q1 effect of tax rate was 15% compared to 20% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher excess tax benefits and share based compensation. Turning to cash flow, Q1 operating cash flow was $308 million compared with $251 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $260 million compared with $185 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase in cash flow was primarily due to improved working capital. Capital allocation for the quarter included $253 million of share repurchases, $109 million in cash dividends, $48 million of CapEx and $36 million for acquisition. Additionally, out of an abundance of caution, we made the decision to draw down $800 million from our revolving credit facility. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and have an additional $1.4 billion of committed undrawn capacity remaining on the revolver. We've also taken numerous actions over the past several years to restructure our debt maturity profile and de-risk our pension liability. As a result, we have no debt maturities in 2020 or 2021 absent the revolver and no expected pension contribution until 2023. The strong liquidity position and balance sheet provides us with the capital deployment flexibility for acquisition opportunity in the future. Moving to segment results, Q1 products and systems integration sales were $993 million, down $76 million or 7% driven by a decline in Professional and Commercial Radio, partially offset by strong growth in Video Security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $24 million and currency headwinds were $5 million. Operating earnings were $123 million or 12.4% of sales, down 140 basis points from last year due to the lower revenue. Notable Q1 wins in the segment include a $28 million Video Security award for a large utility customer in North America, of which $10 million was recognized as revenue in Q1; over $50 million of sales into governments across the entire Video Security portfolio, a $13 million P25 order for Port of Los Angeles California; a $12 million P25 order for Dinwiddie County, Virginia and an $8 million TETRA order for Germany's Armed Forces. Moving to Software & Services, revenue was $662 million up $74 million or 13% from last year, driven by growth in Command Center Software & Services. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $24 million and currency headwinds were $2 million. Operating earnings were $224 million or 33.8% of sales, up 520 basis points from last year, driven by higher gross margins and improved operating leverage. Notable Q1s in the segment include an $8 million P25 multi-year service contract extension with Cleveland, Ohio; a $6 million P25 multi-year services contract in Latin America; a $4 million Command Center Software suite contract with Brampton, Ontario; and a $3 million Command Center Software suite contract with Ft. Wayne, Indiana. Looking at regional results, during the quarter we restructured our operations to realize more operational efficiencies combining EMEA, Asia Pac and Latin America into one region, which is now reflected as the International. Accordingly, we now report net sales in two regions; North America, which includes the United States and Canada, and International. North America Q1 revenue was $1.1 billion, up 4% driven by growth in Video Security, Command Center Software & Services, partially offset by a decline in professional and commercial radio. International Q1 revenue was $539 million, down 7% due to a decline in Professional and Commercial Radio, primarily in Asia Pac. Moving to backlog, ending backlog was $10.4 billion, up $48 million compared to last year, inclusive of $462 million of unfavorable currency rates. Sequentially backlog was down $821 million due to $407 million of unfavorable currency rate, revenue recognition of the Airwave and ESN contract and typical North America order seasonality. Software & Services backlog was up $120 million or 2% compared to last year due to growth in North America multi-year agreements, partially offset by $423 million of unfavorable currency rates. Sequentially backlog was down $604 million, primarily due to $368 million of unfavorable currency rate and revenue recognition for ESN and Airwave. Product and SI segment backlog was down $72 million or 2% compared to last year, inclusive of $39 million of unfavorable currency rate. A decline in international backlog was partially offset by growth in North America. Sequentially backlog was down $217 million, driven primarily by typical North America order seasonality. Turning to our outlook, we expect Q2 sales to be down between 17% and 14%, with non-GAAP EPS between $1.18 and $1.27. This assumes approximately $30 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately $175 million shares, and an effective tax rate of between 24% and 25%. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg. Hi Jim, this is Gino. On the first part of the question, clearly we've seen pressure in Professional and Commercial Radio. Certain verticals have been significantly impacted. You can think about hospitality, transportation, specifically airlines, oil and gas, manufacturing related to the pandemic and the shutdown for shelter-in-place orders. We have seen some impact to public safety as our engagements have been delayed, both in terms of site work, but also in terms of being able to talk to customers. Obviously our customers are on the front lines of dealing with a pandemic and there's certainly been a delay in that engagement and the ability to talk to our customers really frankly beginning in mid-March, lasting through April and certainly in larger markets through May. And it's also important to note that embedded in that guidance, we continue to expect Command Center and Video Security \u2013 Command Center Software and Video Security to grow in Q2. But that dimensionally, PCR, certain verticals very much impacted, public safety characterized as a move to the right, based on as you said, logistics and inability to get in front of people and get to sites. Yeah, so Paul I think it is. If you look at it, because of the broad spread nature when we do business, Greg has said it hit 180 countries; there's 120 of those that we do business. In general if you look at it on the surface, it's essentially had an equal weighting and I think the reason for that is because it hasn't \u2013 the opportunities have just gone away. It's been that we've had some of the same limits, physically engaging with customers, going to sites and physically deploying systems and those kind of things. There has been essentially equal opportunity, delays as it's related to those things. So I'd say in general, it's been felt largely equally around the globe. Yeah well, I think what we're trying to say is that Q2 is a timing issue, not an evaporation issue. And its acute negative 14 to negative 17, but it's not evaporating. It's going to the right and there might be some that evaporates, but we think it's a pretty small percentage. It's really representative of things being pushed to the right in that Professional Commercial Radio category."

            "content": "Hey George, it's Kelly. Absolutely, we do see that as an opportunity for us, not just in the in NG9-1-1, which is a refresh of the backbone associated with the 911 call center to help turn it into more of a broadband backbone, but it's also \u2013 there's been a lot of interest and related to cloud as a result of this pandemic, where a lot of our customers in the past have been operating with their equipment on an on-prem basis where they operate it there. The need to be able to operate it remotely is something that's definitely been introduced as part of this pandemic. The good news is we've already been investing in cloud and a good portion of our software was already cloud enabled. But as you heard Greg mention in our remarks, we're accelerating our investments even more in cloud based on the demand we see now. We just launched our first CAD customer in the cloud. By the end of this year our CAD, our records portfolio will be completely cloud enabled and in early next year we'll be \u2013 our 911 efforts will all be cloud enabled as well. So it does definitely drive that and yes, we do see some of those dollars starting to flow through as folks prioritize not just NG9-1-1, but the rest of the command center software refresh. So Sami, its Kelly. It's a combination of both. Actually in the first quarter we actually picked up a number of new customers. Frankly more new customers than suite customers, which is great, because that gives us the opportunity to land and expand those customers and grow the platform in the width and the depth of what we provide to them. We are still seeing also though many of our customers are still moving and we are expanding and adding more modules of the Command Center Suite. As you probably recall, as I've said the past, folks don't walk in and buy typically all the components at one time, simply because of the risk profile of a Command Center and a 911 Center. They will schedule and they will do 911 one year, CAD the next year, Record the next year, and the thing that we watch is how we're doing regards to penetrating across those positions and we are still seeing good progress on that. So I don't know if you have a follow-up on that, but that's pretty much how we look at the Command Center, that's the performance and why we saw the growth we did in Q1."

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks Time. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts on the business before Gino takes us through our Q1 results and second quarter outlook. First, I'd like to start by thanking our more than 17,000 people around the world for their resilience, adaptability and unwavering commitment to our customers. We made the decision in mid-March to have the vast majority of our workforce do their jobs remotely and they've successfully and smoothly transitioned to their new environments. Those who needed to work on-site have shown a fearless dedication to our customers, leaving the safety of their homes to ensure that our mission critical operation centers and customer sites remain reliable and always on. I'd also like to say that we're deeply thankful for the actions of the public safety and healthcare professionals that are keeping us and our community safe, and we're acutely aware of our responsibility to them during these unprecedented times. Because of this, our employees have gone to great lengths to continue to support them and I could not be more proud of their efforts. Second, despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19 we grew earnings per share by 16% during the quarter, expanded operating margins by 200 basis points and generated $308 million of operating cash flow, an increase of 23% versus the prior year. Additionally, we continue to see strong demand for our Video Security Solutions, highlighted by a $28 million order from a large utility in North America, the single largest order in the history of the Avigilon business, and our Software & Services segment grew sales by 13% and expanded operating margins by 520 basis points. And finally, while the COVID-19 pandemic has confirmed the fundamental need for our mission critical solutions, it's also brought uncertainties surrounding its severity, impact and duration. So as a result we made the decision to withdraw our full year guidance at this time. We'll reassess this decision at the end of the second quarter based on the information and clarity we have at that time. And with that, I'll now turn the call over Gino to provide additional details on Q1 and our second quarter outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts. Thanks Gino. I thought I would end with a few high level comments regarding the full year impact COVID-19 is having on our business and how we're responding. First, while this pandemic has disrupted and delayed our engagements with some customers and will have an impact on certain parts of our business, we remain fully committed to continue investing in our growth businesses. In Command Center Software we are accelerating our development to move to the cloud and recently launched our first cloud enabled CAD customer. We also expect our records in CAD solutions to be fully cloud enabled by the end of this year with our 911 software to follow in 2021. In the Video Security business I'm very pleased with the continued traction with our enterprise and government customers, and will continue to invest in our H5 camera line, analytics, cloud based VMS solutions and features that integrate video and land mobile radio, while also expanding our sales coverage. Additionally, our durable cash flow generation and strong balance sheet put us in a unique position to be opportunistic with respect to acquisitions going forward. Second, while this is a critical time to continue to invest, we're also taking actions in a number of other areas to reduce our operating expenses. We now expect operating expenses to be down approximately $210 million versus 2019, which is a $150 million more than the annual decrease we discussed on our last earnings call. This additional reduction driven by lower to variable compensation, lower discretionary spend in areas such as travel and contractors and third party expenses and a reduction in real-estate should allow us to slightly expand operating margins for this year. And finally, Motorola Solutions has been providing mission critical solutions to customers on the front line for over 90 years, and have managed through a number of crises, and I couldn't be more proud of how our people have responded to this one. Whether it's our Airwaves team enabling network coverage for temporary hospitals being built in the U.K. or our team helping the customer move their 911 command center operations to a back-up location in days, where one of their employees tested positive for COVID, our teams are going to great lengths to make sure our customers mission critical needs are met. We entered this pandemic in a very secure position and I absolutely believe that we'll emerge an even stronger company on the other side of it. And now, let me turn this call back over to Tim. Yeah, and Tim I would add that even though things have been pushed to the right, you know we're a different company now than we were several years ago. The good news is, you know we still expect Software & Services to grow this year. It could grow mid-single digits, we'll see, but we still expect that to grow. We do expect Video Security to grow, Command Center Software as part of Software & Services and I actually think \u2013 look, I think the severity of Q2 isn't so much as things have changed in public safety. I actually don't think they have. I think they've been pushed. Two or three weeks in March we effectively became locked down in major locations domestically here in the states. That lockdown has continued in May, as well as April. So I think when you look at Q2 and see the sharpness of that decline, it's really things pushing to the right than any structural or behavioral patterns to the changing in public safety. What we do is still a need-to-do versus a nice-to-do, but obviously the situation is pretty extensive given that it's a combination of a public health crisis, as well as a dramatic economic decline in 180-plus countries all at once. So hence I think our prudent approach at this point in time. I think the product segment for the full year will be down as things push to the right. It could be down low double digits; again, we'll have to see. But I think with resilient backlog and an overall strength of our position with 75% -- about 75% of our business is public safety and government and 25% enterprise, I still think we're well positioned. Yeah, sure Tim. Yeah, I think the difference is again in \u2013 unlike last time where we had the financial Great Recession and things recovered, what we've experienced here is a little bit like the market seizing up, literally. We couldn't get in front of customers, many customers on the sales side from an engagement standpoint and even on services and implementations, deployments, we are pushed out as well. I think we're much better position this time. Software & Services is a little bit more than a third of our business, most of that largely recurring long term contracts, mission critical in nature. If I rewind the tape last time, that was 20% or sub 20% of our overall revenue. The other thing is, even though we're having a difficult Q2, and Jack could comment on this, but we're seeing the funnel. Even though projects get pushed to the right, we've actually just over the last few weeks and months seen a constant replenishment of projects coming in too. So we just thought given the fog and uncertainty and the uniqueness of this thing, in a once and literally a century pandemic. It was kind of prudent for us to suspend full year guidance at this time. But I think we are much better positioned. I think we still expect growth in video, we still expect growth in Command Center Software. The professional and commercial radio business, which is think of the radio business for commercial, has been hit hard serving verticals like hospitality, transportation, airline, gaming and some of the things that have been hit particularly hard. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything. No, I don't think; in fact we see the opposite of that. During this time we see the importance and criticality of land, mobile, radio versus any alleged migration or shift to LTE. I think LTE is complementary; it's a data broadband network that's an extension of LMR. Actually our APX NEXT product that integrates broadband with land, mobile, radio is best positioned to take advantage of that. I know that there's been some speculation or commentary that suggests that LTE is starting to cannibalize. We see no \u2013 absolutely no indication of that, and if anything maybe the opposite. So, just maybe one thing to add to that. Obviously we see that we have an LTE, a public safety LTE device in the LEX11, but more importantly as Greg said, we have a collaborative device in terms of APX NEXT; it does P25 obviously. And the focus here is and what we've seen in the pandemic and the response with public safety is fundamental when someone calls 911, there is a multitude of things that happened, but that puts our technology in place, and there's been more strain on the networks, which really is evidence to the fact of why you need a purpose built network? But a really good example was a major \u2013 without getting into specifics, a major city health department, procured APX NEXT devices because they needed to talk to the front line fire and EMS people, but also wanted that backup capability when they left the city and it was a big health department. There was really traditionally a secondary type customer for Motorola that bought obviously high tier equipment in terms of APX NEXT. So this thing has really been \u2013 a lot of what we're seeing in Q2 has really been the ability to not get to physical sites, to not engage physically with customers and I think that's really the challenge and we view that as being kind of a short term challenge. Well, I think that \u2013 I think our view is reflected in the commentary that we gave. They are a much smaller player in the business. I think we have much more extensive installed base and contacts and annuity revenues, but as I mentioned, you know Q2 is very unique, because as Malloy pointed out, just that this year's logistical difficulty of customer engagement and deployment. But do I think product revenues are likely to decline? Yes, and I think they will be on a decline that will be comparable to what we saw in the land, mobile, radio business actually in \u201809. But again, that's more about delayed and deferred demand, than any demand that's actually lost or goes away and I think it will recover and I think public safety is demonstrated over the last several years and longer. It remains at the top of the food chain. So I think they have a certain view of the market, that's their opinion, but I would maintain that I think we have a very long standing and more thorough and comprehensive perspective. Yeah, Paul the professional and commercial radio last year, again as Gino referenced, I think land, mobile, radio for commercial and enterprise, last year all in with about $1 billion. So as we think about it this year, obviously that's the area that's come under the most pressure, and two-thirds of that is vertical served; airlines, retail, hospitality, oil and gas that had been the most significantly impacted. So that's what's driving the more pronounced double digit decline in that area. Okay Ben, so I dimensionalize our business. It's not \u2013 all things are not the same. There's big projects and then there's an amount of what you call kind of term agreement and grass roots business, that by the way has continued to an extent to continue to flow. Large projects typically go through \u2013 you get a request for proposal and that's a timeline, but then you have elements where they have to go through board approval, city council approvals, state procurement approvals and the like to use that example and really what Gino and what Greg have referenced, is a lot of those meetings have been delayed. So there's not an issue that we have to go resell, re-canvas if you will. It's really just the procedural milestones have moved to the right, whereby we've had to kind of reshuffle the milestones have moved to the right, whereby we've had to kind of reshuffle the milestones of a project and just extend them out you know into the second half and those kind of things. That's been the issue, it hasn't ended. The good news is, with video technology and those kind of things, we've been able to stay engaged with our customers, answer questions and all those kind of things, but it's really just a milestone type thing where we've seen the delays. And as we've talked about you know the physical access to get not only at sites, but in the Command Center and those kind of things as well. If we've got to go do work with those people there, there's been some delays as it relates to those things as well. So, Paul it's a great question, and one that frankly has us. If there's a lot of things that we \u2013 this has been certainly a struggle in the last couple of months for most companies, but it really delights us in the fact that we've added substantially in terms of the Video Security and Analytics portfolio to the company. Right now our teams are working on and will be \u2013 in May and June will be continuing to market Video Analytics Solutions around social distancing, around mask compliance and detection in campuses, in manufacturing facilities, in the public domain, fever scanning technology, as well as contact tracing. So analytics that will essentially tell you if you think about a lot of the dialogue around getting return to campuses, returned-to-schools and the like. Our access control solutions will be able to monitor and tell you if somebody was sick, who went through that door at that school, who might likely have come in contact with someone who is sick. So as much as we'll see, maybe a change or a moderation of a different type of opportunities. Our Video Security and Analytic space put a spot on in that. I also think the move in Kelly and his team have done a great job, moving the Command Center to the cloud, but if you look at our vigilant cloud services business, this has been I think \u2013 we've moved 35,000 cameras to the cloud so far this year. So I think with every challenge comes an opportunity and the Video Security Analytics Business is one that I think has an opportunity to benefit from this. If you talk to a paramedic, a police officer or a firemen, they tell you the most important piece of equipment that they have, that they've always had and this is a millennial firemen or it's a fireman's who has been on the job for 30 years, the single most important communication and the lifeline that they have is a two way radio. We don't see that changing. Our customers are telling us they don't see that changing. Yeah, I think that well, it largely reflects and is driven by as Gino mentioned, the professional and commercial radio segment itself. So radio for corporate verticals, that's the most accentuated pressure point on Q2. The second is the engagement and deployment, and again, it was the second half of March, April and largely a lot of May as well, and we just thought if we're going to guide Q2, let's do it in a responsible prudent way and move forward accordingly. But that, it's really... Yeah. Well, maybe if I could. So the PCR if you think about it, I think you talked about Verizon. The traditional PCR, if you think about it from a competitive set, it's companies like Kenwood, like Hytera, ICOM, a number of the those type of people, and so I think they've \u2013 without a doubt they felt the same thing. And again, those are private systems dedicated towards a refinery, an airline, The Marriott Hotel and those kind of things, and I think that industry has equally felt it, because there's a physical element of design and deployment of a system as well. Verizon's a lot different. You could go and pick up at a kiosk, you could have a phone delivered and you can pick it up. So I wouldn't see the same sort of physical \u2013 you know the delay if you will that we would see in our business, so I think that's really what... [Cross Talk]. I think it would be a small portion of it. I mean you know the example is, if an airline goes out of business, well that's one airline that won't need a radio system. But as we look at it, it's relatively \u2013 we view that to be a relatively small subset of the customers, frankly. Walt, that's exactly right, and look, I can't speak to the exact timing of quarterly alignment. I don't know if we're that precise, but you are right that as airlines recover, people start to fly again, people go to Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, the states and the economies and commerce reopen, because does that business and the acute pressure downward start to improve, yes it will improve. Yeah, no problem Walt. Thank you. Well, I think what I would say is this. Obviously this is a situation that I don't think any of us have seen before. We've had 9/11; we've had dot-com collapse; we've had the Lehman Brothers Great Recession. This one is different and that it's 187 countries and it's a compilation of both the public health crisis and an act of severe economic downturn at once and they're intertwined. So if I take a step back and think about, are we in the right businesses? Do we have brand equity? Do we have strength in incumbency? Do we have a greater percentage of recurring revenues in software and services? And I look at Command Center Software that will continue to grow, we believe it should grow this year even in the face of this. Video security and analytics, we expect to grow even in the face of this. Software and services, we would expect and still could grow around mid-single digits even in the face of this, and the incumbent footprint and strength that we have in our installed base of 13,000 land, mobile, radio networks worldwide, with probably our strongest anchor tenant position being North America. Is that a good business to be in? We absolutely believe that. We'll monetize services, we'll move upstream, by the way we'll integrate these as well. We'll integrate video security with integrated land, mobile, radio networks as an anchor tenant conveyor of communications and critical information in this addressable market, and we zero out China, forget China. It is a $40 billion addressable market. Is it temporarily dislocated? Obviously the answer is yes, and that's reflected in the Q2 guide. We always guide. I've never in my career not guided for a full year, this is the first. We just think it was a prudent thing to do. There's a lot of variables and things that are moving around, but it doesn't change the fundamental strength, attributes, longevity and advantages that our brand and our market position and the technologies we play, we can capitalize on, which is also why we are going to continue to invest organically. Sales coverage, video security, command center software to the cloud, hearing a different \u2013 and newer radios that you'll see later this year and next year and we're going to continue to invest inorganically, and I think this is an opportunity to prioritize capital deployment around acquisitions of assets that they're having temporary dislocation, that may make sense for us accretively to fold into Motorola Solutions. So there's no doubt it's a tough environment, but I really believe and I think our team does too, that this is an opportunity to invest and lean in responsibly, take down the breakeven and take out $210 million of OpEx and position the firm even stronger to come out of the other end in 2021 and beyond, and that's exactly what we're going to do. I would say it's going forward. It may take a little bit longer, but there's a couple of opportunities the we're engaged with now, and that dialogue has begun, we'll see. Most of them don't pan out, but I don't see and right now Jim, as we're in the middle of May, this is another area that I feel is kind of reopening if you will. I don't see conversations in this regard being encumbered that will delay any plans or opportunities that come our way. Thank you."

            "name": "Jack Molloy",
            "content": "Yeah, maybe just a couple of things. As we look around the globe, things are starting to open up in certain countries in Asia Pac who was frankly hit first. So there's potentially some signs of encouragement there in terms of reengaging with customers, customers focus moving back to technology projects. The second thing that I think that all of us feel pretty proud of is the team, their ability to continuously staying engage virtually with the customers by way of video, conference mechanisms, but also we held a video, a virtual trade show for our Video Security and Analytics Business, because an industry was canceled in March and we actually had \u2013 we had over 30% more people that actually attended our virtual conference than would have attended the conference in person, and literally had chat rooms, questions and everything from access control, school safety, and so we're encouraged by a lot of those things. We actually even see here into April, certain states engagements starting to improve and so it's just one of things. Obviously the pandemic has taken the focus of our customers and we'll continue to work with them in any way we can to support them. So hey George, it's Jack. A couple things. I think it's always important \u2013 we see there's been a lot written, a lot discussed around state and local budgets. I think it's very important to decompose what those budgets mean. The reality of state and local budgets, there's a confluence of probably five to six different funding streams: federal transfer dollars, federal grant dollars, property tax, income tax, sales tax in some states, but also 911 funding, which is one of the real reasons why we've made a lot of acquisitions in the command center space, because part and parcel, that's a different funding streams that's essentially protected. So it's a number of those things, but I go back to \u2013 you know one of the benefits we have of being a company that's close to 95 years old is we've gone through a number of these things after 911 and they're all a little different, the Great Recession. But what we've seen and when we've gone back and looked at the data, it suggests that public safety gets prioritized in these things. There's other things around the margins that may get delayed, may get deferred, all those kind of things, but at the end of the day when \u2013 we've even seen it as evidence in this response to the pandemic, you need to have the best technology in the hands of those first responders. We think that gets protected. There's always \u2013 by the way the budget situations in state and local haven't been easy for the last number of years. I think that's lastly where our sales team, as much as they have relationships and everything, we've got a very veteran team out there that's very focused at working with our customers to navigate funding plans and they are really holistic plans that they work with our customer base. So I think we'll come out of this with the same level of priority that public safety has always gotten, if not more George, so I think that answers your question. Yes, so I'd start with \u2013 listen, if we were selling and I don't want to \u2013 if we were selling something that that they would deem is non-critical, non-essential to their work flow communications, I'd maybe be a little bit concerned. But I think the fact that you're selling mission critical communications, you are at the very top of the priority chain, that's a good thing. But it's interesting. If you look at it, a lot of our customers feel like property taxes, you know a lot of these things. If there is a recovery gets a little bit sharper, they may not have the impact that we had. Obviously there's been a pretty significant impact as it relates to sales tax, but remember, most of our things are things that they've been planned for multiple years, their technology upgrades, expansions and those kind of things related to mission critical and we've kind of went through this before, went through this a little bit after 911; certainly felt this. You know I was pretty close to the customer back in 2009 and navigated a team in the central United States that was probably hit frankly from a budget perspective harder than everybody and we saw some things delayed. We had some additional questions to answer, but every deal that we had at that point in time continued to move forward and I think I look at that as encouraging as we move through this pandemic. So obviously Q2 as Greg, Gino, as we pointed out, there's been some limitations in terms of just ability to meet and some of those no customer engagements, you know that's been the issue for Q2. But I would tell you Sami, looking at Q1, where we were coming out of the end of March in Q1, it was the best quarter we've had with Avigilon. Frankly we had talked about growing three times the market. We're taking more share. Particularly in North America the team has done an outstanding job. We've made significant investments in go-to-market, even greater investments in research and development. I spoke to some of the interesting things we are working on and pandemic response earlier. We've got a completely new line of H5 cameras, software analytic investments we've made, that's not even to include what we've invested in in public safety and WatchGuard, the acquisition of WatchGuard and VaaS and we're doing there. So we actually \u2013 we expect the businesses, assuming return to normal, sometime in the third quarter, we expect to get back to those growth rate levels if not greater."

Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg.\nGregory Brown: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook.  First, I'm very pleased with our performance during the quarter and, in particular, our ability to navigate the current supply chain environment to deliver the critical solutions that our customers rely on every day. We achieved revenue at the higher end of our guidance and earnings per share above our guidance, ended the year with record backlog of $13.6 billion, up 19% versus last year, and generated $703 million of operating cash flow during the quarter and a record $1.8 billion for the full year.  Second, our full year results exemplify the strength and durability of our business and highlight our ability to leverage our large installed base to sell more value-add software and services. For the year, the Software and Services segment grew 13%, expanded operating margins by 210 basis points and accounted for 38% of total sales and 54% of total operating earnings for the company. Additionally, revenue was up double digits in all 3 technologies in the segment, led by 39% growth in video security and access control software, which resulted in approximately $400 million for that category of revenue for the year.  And finally, looking ahead to this year, our record backlog and continued demand are informing our expectations for another year of strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth, with growth in both segments despite the ongoing and fluid supply chain challenges.  At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Our Q4 results included revenue of $2.3 billion, up 2%, including $10 million from acquisitions and $6 million from favorable currency. GAAP operating earnings of $549 million and operating margins of 23.7% compared to 24.4% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $670 million, up $3 million. And non-GAAP operating margins of 28.9%, down 40 basis points due to higher operating expenses for employee incentive compensation and acquisitions.  Operating margin in Products and Systems Integration was down 170 basis points due to lower sales and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in the Software and Services segment. GAAP earnings per share of $2.30 compared to $2.37 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.85 versus $2.86 last year with higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services, offset by, within the Products and Systems Integration segment, higher OpEx related to incentives and acquisitions, along with lower sales. OpEx in Q4 was $518 million, up $26 million versus last year, primarily due to higher employee incentive compensation and acquisitions. The Q4 effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 21% in the prior year.  For the full year of 2021, revenue was $8.2 billion, up 10%, with growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. Revenue from acquisitions was $120 million and the FX impact was $130 million favorable during the year. GAAP operating earnings were $1.7 billion or 20.4% of sales versus 18.7% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.1 billion, up $282 million. And non-GAAP operating margins were 25.9% of sales, up from 24.8% of sales in the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. This increase in profitability also includes $100 million of higher employee incentive compensation earned in 2021.  GAAP earnings per share was $7.17 compared to $5.45 in the prior year, driven by higher sales, improved leverage, higher other income and lower reorganization charges in the current year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $9.15, up 19% from $7.69 in 2020 on higher sales, higher operating earnings, higher other income, which was partially offset by a higher tax rate.  For the full year, OpEx was $1.9 billion, up $123 million versus last year, primarily driven by higher employee incentive compensation and acquisitions. And the effective tax rate for 2021 was 21% compared to 20% in the prior year on higher benefits from discrete items, including the benefits of stock comp expense booked in the prior year.  Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $703 million, flat versus the prior year. And free cash flow was $635 million versus $637 million in the prior year. And for the full year, OCF was a record $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year, and free cash flow was a record $1.6 billion versus $1.4 billion in the prior year. The increase in cash flow was driven by higher sales, higher earnings and partially offset by higher cash taxes.  Capital allocation for 2021 included $528 million of share repurchases at an average price of $208.41, $482 million in cash dividends and $457 million for acquisitions. Additionally, during the year, we issued $850 million of new long-term debt, redeemed $324 million of outstanding debt, entered into a new upsized $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and ended the year with $1.9 billion of cash and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of only 1.6. We also increased our dividend 11%, our 11th consecutive year of a double-digit increase, and we announced a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program in the second quarter.  Moving to our segment results. Q4 Products and System Integration sales were $1.5 billion, down 1%, which was impacted by the supply constraints we discussed on the last call. Growth in video security and public safety LMR was offset by a decline in PCR. And revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $4 million. Operating earnings were $378 million or 25.3% of sales, down from 27% in the prior year, driven by higher employee incentive compensation and lower sales.  Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include a $98 million P25 upgrade for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, $94 million of APX NEXT device orders in North America, a $68 million P25 device upgrade for the District of Columbia, a $28 million P25 upgrade for a large U.S. customer, a $21 million fixed video security order for a large North America utility customer, a $19 million additional TETRA order from the German MOD and a $17 million TETRA device upgrade for a customer in Asia Pacific. And for the full year, revenue was $5 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by higher sales of LMR and higher sales of video security.  Revenue from acquisitions was $89 million. Operating earnings were $976 million or 19.4% of sales, up from 19% in the prior year on higher sales, partially offset by higher OpEx.  Moving next to our Software and Services segment. Q4 revenue was $824 million, up 8% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security software and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $6 million. Operating earnings were $292 million or 35.4% of sales, up 150 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and improved leverage.  Some notable Q4 wins in this segment include a $25 million P25 multiyear services contract with Cook County, Illinois, a $17 million P25 multiyear software upgrade agreement for ICI Systems Authority in California, a $17 million body-worn camera as a service order for the City of Houston, Texas police department, a $15 million P25 multiyear software upgrade for Orange County, California and a $14 million additional body-worn camera order for the French MOI, a $11 million command center software hybrid cloud order for North Carolina Department of Public Safety, and we saw a 27% growth in software for video security and access control.  For the full year, revenue was $3.1 billion, up 13% on growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions was $31 million. Operating earnings were $1.1 billion or 36.4% of sales, up 210 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved leverage.  Looking at regional results. North America Q4 revenue was $1.6 billion, up 4% on growth in video security and LMR products and services. For the full year, North America revenue was $5.6 billion, up 11%, with growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. International Q4 was $705 million, down 3% due to a decline in LMR, partially offset with growth in video security and command center software. We saw growth in Latin America during the quarter, while EMEA was flat and Asia Pac declined. For the full year, international revenue was $2.6 billion, up 9%, with growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. Revenue was up in EMEA and Latin America, offset by a slight decline in Asia Pac.  Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog was a record $13.6 billion, up $2.2 billion compared to last year, driven by the U.K. Home Office's exercise of their contractual right to extend the Airwave network 4 years through 2026, along with record LMR product orders and growth in Software and Services contracts in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $2.2 billion, driven by the Airwave extension and record LMR product orders in North America during the fourth quarter.  Software and Services backlog was up $1.3 billion compared to last year and up $1.8 billion sequentially, driven by the Airwave extension and growth in Software and Services agreements in North America. Products and SI backlog was up $886 million compared to last year, driven by record LMR orders. Sequentially, backlog was up $417 million, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter.  Turning next to our outlook for 2022. For the full year, we expect sales to be up approximately 7%, with mid-single-digit growth in products and systems integration and approximately 10% growth in Software and Services. And we expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share between $9.80 and $9.95. This outlook assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 21% to 22%. It also assumes $120 million of higher material costs, largely driven by the current semiconductor market dynamics of limited supply and us procuring available parts at a premium from other secondary markets. Additionally, we expect pricing adjustments to our portfolio, which we've recently made to take effect as we progress in fulfilling existing backlog.  For Q1, we expect sales to be up approximately 3%, with non-GAAP EPS between $1.53 and $1.59 per share, inclusive of $50 million of the incremental material costs I referenced for the year. It also assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count between 173 million and 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 17%.  We expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion. This OCF outlook include $75 million of higher employee incentive payments earned in 2021 and $150 million of higher cash taxes, half of which is driven by the U.S. federal tax requirement to capitalize R&D beginning in 2022. And for the full year, we will continue to be diligent in our cost management. We expect OpEx to be up approximately $100 million from last year, driven by investments in video security and command center software, inclusive of $40 million related to recent acquisitions.  I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg.\nGregory Brown: Thanks, Jason. Let me just end this piece with a few additional thoughts. First, 2021 was an outstanding year for our company. We achieved record orders, sales, earnings and cash flow. We increased backlog, $2.2 billion. And we returned approximately $1 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, we continue to invest in our video security and command center software offerings with the acquisitions of Openpath, Envysion and 911 Data Master.  Second, I'd like to provide you with a little bit more color on what we're currently seeing with supply and demand and how that impacts our current 2022 expectations. Demand across all 3 technologies was incredibly strong in 2021. In fact, it even accelerated in Q4. Like many companies, procuring semiconductor supply to meet our increasing demand has been challenging, and the environment in Q4 was even further impacted with supplier delays and the impact of the Omicron variant. In particular, delays from some semiconductor suppliers required us, as Jason just referenced, to substitute parts from alternative sources at higher costs, and this will impact margins for Q1 and Q2.  For the full year, we still expect solid revenue growth in the Products segment, driven by both video security and LMR products, inclusive of PCR. We've taken a careful look at our portfolio and made further pricing adjustments that we anticipate will take effect in the second half of the year and lead to 2022 full year gross margins that will be comparable and operating margins that will be slightly higher year-over-year.  Third, I'm really pleased with our position for growth. The funding environment for our customers continues to remain exceptionally strong. Our APX NEXT refresh cycle is gaining traction with our public safety customers with almost $100 million in Q4 orders alone. We continue to capture market share in our video security and command center software businesses and our recurring revenues continue to grow. And our balance sheet is stronger than ever, which allows us to be opportunistic in our deployment of capital in this current environment.  And finally, I'd like to just recognize all of the Motorola employees around the world who, despite the pandemic, have never wavered in their commitment to our customers and also in giving back. Last year, our foundation donated more than $12 million to charitable organizations, and our employees volunteered a record 65,000 hours in more than 40 countries. I'm incredibly proud of their efforts and of the recognition we continue to receive. We were recently named again to Fortune's Most Admired Companies and as one of the 100 Best ESG companies by Investor's Business Daily.  I'm also really pleased with our recent announcement that Dr. Ayanna Howard will be joining our Board. Her perspective and experience in AI and robotics will be invaluable as we continue advancing these technologies that deliver public safety and enterprise security.  I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and welcome your questions.\nTim Yocum: Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question? Question-and-Answer Session\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Tim Long with Barclays.\nTimothy Long: I've got 1 question, and afterwards, I'll come back with a follow-up. Greg, can you talk a little bit about Airwave? Nice to see that signed for the 4-year extension. Could you talk a little bit at a high level about how we should think about economics of that deal pricing or anything relevant? And were there any other incremental opportunities potentially that -- or a part of that and any impact on the government kind of investigating your position in those networks? And then I've got a follow-up after that.\nGregory Brown: Sure. Thanks, Tim. We were pleased about the extension of Airwave. The U.K. Home Office exercised their contractual right in December to extend it by 4 years to the end of 2026. Obviously, we welcome that. We think that's good news. We also think that's a continuing reflection of the criticality and the importance of what that network does for British first responders.  It was extended at contractual existing pricing. And having said that, we also, in parallel, continue to work with the Competition Markets Authority as they continue to progress with their investigation. We're actively engaged with them. And I think by their own time line, the CMA expects to conclude their work by, I think, sometime in the summer or the mid or end of summer, and we would update you accordingly. But we obviously feel good about this development, and we're very proud of the resilience and the investment we continue to make in Airwave.\nTimothy Long: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on the video end market. Numbers were good for the year, very good for the year. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the outlook there? You did 30%-plus growth this year. And also if you could weave into that kind of what you're seeing from some of these other -- whether it's NDAA and the potential for FCC involvement with Chinese players and how that could impact the growth profile for that business.\nGregory Brown: Yes, Tim. I'm really pleased with the execution by Jack Molloy and John Kedzierski and Mahesh in our full Video Security and Access Control business. For the year, the category -- the technology category grew 32%, 21% organic, which I think is great. And for 2022, our outlook is and expectation is for video security and access control to grow approximately 20%.  When we look at the category in total, we think that market in the main is probably growing 7% or 8%. So the good news is we continue to take share. We've taken share in 2021. We can -- I believe we'll take share again in 2022. We're getting really good traction in the government vertical, which Avigilon had a very nascent presence in. We're updating and refreshing the product portfolio, both on fixed video, and of course, we acquired Pelco and Indigo Vision. We've refreshed the camera portfolio. We're doing more investment in software and analytics. Mahesh is leading the refresh around in-car and body-worn camera. And I'm also very pleased with the Openpath acquisition we did earlier.  I like our execution. The addressable market in 2022 is now, we believe, $18 billion, $3 billion larger than last year. We're taking share. We're growing and I like our outlook.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nErik Lapinski: This is Erik on for Meta. Maybe to follow up on some of the comments on the video side and specific to the deal you announced at the Houston police department on body cameras. I guess, I know they had paused their deployment a couple of years ago and cited concerns around technology as the reason. I'm wondering if you could give some color on maybe some of the development or improvements you made there in light of the refreshes you mentioned and like just what the lift was from a tech perspective and if that's mostly done.\nJohn Molloy: Sure, Erik. It's Jack. So you're correct. When we originally acquired WatchGuard a few years back, they had had some quality issues with Houston. We put the full team's focus on improving the quality, both from a back-end standpoint as well as from a device standpoint. We've also pivoting our offer in the body-worn space to an as a service offer, and we think that was compelling for the City of Houston.  At the end of the day, we've got long-standing and broad relationships with the City of Houston. I think they trusted us as MSI, as Motorola Solutions to come and fix the appropriate quality issues as we have throughout our history. And I think we're going to have a real happy customer there.  As it relates to body worn in general, it's probably also important to highlight that for the full year, our orders more than doubled. Q4 '21 was a record orders quarter for us. And I'd also highlight that moving forward, we're really well positioned for growth internationally. We think that, in general, the market has wanted an alternative. And as Greg said, we believe we're taking share both domestically and internationally in the body-worn space.\nErik Lapinski: Awesome. And then maybe just on the supply chain side. It seems like you're mostly seeing headwinds in PCR just based on growth rates. But are you also seeing them kind of across the board in video as well, just less severe? If anything kind of from product-wise you could give color on would be helpful.\nGregory Brown: Yes, Erik, we -- the incremental material semiconductor costs of $120 million for all of '22 is primarily LMR, which is inclusive of PCR. There's also some video in there as well, but we expect the incremental material semiconductor cost to be about $50 million in Q1, $50 million in Q2 and $20 million in the back half as we make progress fulfilling backlog and we have taken additional pricing increases. As the year progresses, our leverage will improve from a P&L and operating earnings standpoint.\nJason Winkler: And on PCR, even with the supply constraints on the year that it had, it grew in 2021 9% to just over $800 million. So despite the supply chain and backlog in that PCR space that were yet to deliver, it grew 9%.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Greg, I wanted to start on the record backlog. Just to be clear, is that something that you can reprice? Or is that locked in? Because the concern would be that margin compression might last a little bit longer if prices are locked in and costs remain elevated. So maybe you could touch on the dynamics there.\nGregory Brown: Yes. I think pricing and backlog is largely fixed and cannot be repriced. I think that's informing the guide we're giving you both for the full year and the linearity of the impact of margins of Q1 and Q2 primarily. But the backlog is as strong as I've ever seen it. And even if you take the extension of Airwave out, it also was still really strong in LMR and PCR as well.\nJason Winkler: I'd also point to the services of our backlog is -- as the largest part of our backlog. And within it, our multiyear services contracts, many of them do have a pricing mechanism around price escalation. So Services and Software has a little bit of a hedge there on parts of the business.\nGregory Brown: Good point, Jason.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. And maybe just a quick clarification on that. Some investors might be concerned that we have price increases coming in the back half of the year and maybe some of this record backlog that we're seeing as some pull forward of demand ahead of those price increases. What would you say to those investors? I'm sure you thought about that.\nJason Winkler: So the bulk of our backlog, again, is direct customers, their public safety in nature. They order when they need things, and we're prioritizing them. We do have a channels business as well, record low inventory levels among the channel. And we're prioritizing the demand signal from them, which we believe to be very clean. So in terms of pull forward and pricing strategies, we've been adjusting price for a number of quarters, and our backlog has been largely unaffected.\nJohn Molloy: And Jason, we obviously track canceled orders, and canceled orders have been de minimis throughout the 2021.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. If I could just get a quick clarification for Jason. It's so unusual for us to deal with the $50 million hit in Q1 and the implied margin. Is there any way for you to help us with margin by segment? Because I'm trying to understand if there's also a step down in Services and Software margin implied in this guidance.\nJason Winkler: The bulk of the $50 million is related to our supply lines around semiconductor, which are embedded in the products, primarily LMR. So the bulk of that $50 million or that $50 million is within the Products segment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.\nKeith Housum: Just a follow-up on the supply chain questions here. Obviously, it's going to get a lot of attention. We're hearing from other people as well that it's just not semiconductors that we're seeing supply chain issues on. Are you guys seeing issues on any other of the components of [indiscernible] materials? And is that perhaps popping up with some frequency over the past few months? And do you have any idea about how it looks for the next few months?\nJason Winkler: The supply chain environment is challenging on the front, Keith, of freight being elevated, which we talked about and most companies are having to navigate those higher prices. The material cost drivers that we've highlighted as incremental this year are entirely around obtaining supply for semiconductors. There are other general price pressures within supply chain, but we are mitigating those. They are not the key challenge that we have. We've navigated those. It's really freight and it's semiconductors.  We have a higher inventory position, too, Keith, I'll point you to on the balance sheet, nearing $800 million of inventory. So we're creating a buffer for the other categories of parts beyond semiconductors so that when the available semiconductors are delivered, that we have the right matching of componentry. So I'd say our key challenges and continuing are around supply chain of semis.\nKeith Housum: And just following up on that. Is the issue here just the fact that you guys are -- either demand is greater than you perhaps originally forecasted for or just that your original suppliers are unable to meet your demand and others?\nJason Winkler: It's both. Our demand has increased, but our original demand signal has not been delivered. We've had delivery delays from a handful of semiconductor suppliers. That's in part what we pointed to and what's driving the incremental costs of $120 million this year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from George Notter with Jefferies.\nGeorge Notter: I guess I wanted to ask about stimulus. If I go back to 2020, if memory serves, I think you said you got $150 million in incremental benefit from the CARES Act on revenue. And I was wondering if you have a comparable number for 2021. Obviously, ARPA might be more of the benefit there. And then also, as you look at your guidance for 2022, what kind of stimulus benefit do you think you have baked into that guidance?\nJohn Molloy: Sure, George. So maybe to start, from a CARES perspective, in 2021, we had about $50 million last year in CARES. And really, the conversations have pivoted to the American rescue plan. As we highlighted, $350 billion available to state and local and then $170 billion available to schools, which is, interestingly enough, one of our biggest vertical solutions for video security and access control. So the funding environment, not only from a stimulus perspective, but actually from a state and local budgets and receipts perspective, has been as good as we've ever seen in my -- really in the history of my business.  But probably more importantly, Jason highlighted it, Greg highlighted it, it's making sure that we've got the attractive portfolio to meet to do that. And so things like APX NEXT and device refresh from an LMR perspective, things like driving new camera portfolio, investing in analytics and AI and the video security, I think, have positioned and married well with the stimulus opportunities, which is what you're seeing in backlog and I think future demand.\nGregory Brown: Yes. The other thing to note is, as you know, this ARPA money is multiyear in duration. So the $350 billion that Jack talked about, the $170 billion, and there's more, some of this multiyear funding goes all the way out to the end of 2024. When you take that visibility of funding, in addition to state and local tax receipts being robust, and then you combine some of the other regulatory things around NDAA, but also more recently, the Secure Equipment Act where the FCC has been directed to direct certain Chinese companies and prevent them from competing like Hytera in LMR or Hikvision in Dahua for fixed video for state and local opportunities in the U.S., that's an incremental benefit as well. So the environment is strong.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. And then any sense for what you've got embedded in your revenue guidance for this year from stimulus?\nJason Winkler: Jack, maybe you can talk about the funnel development. But in terms of it -- it's implied in the both products growth and SNS growth for the year.\nJohn Molloy: Yes. And I think we look at -- we track our ARP funding as well and the pipeline to start '22 just to mentalize it over '21 is up. But again, I think it's more important -- I think equally as important as the stimulus funding is just the condition of state and local budgets in general.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Louie DiPalma with William Blair.\nMichael DiPalma: Greg, I believe you mentioned in your scripted remarks how government demand has been elevated, particularly for the Avigilon video solutions. Is that primarily driven by the Secure Equipment Act from the federal government that you just mentioned? And like how big of an opportunity do you have to take share from some of the Chinese vendors such as Hikvision that are deployed across the federal government and for local government accounts?\nGregory Brown: Yes, Louie, thank you. I think our growth is coming for a variety of reasons. I think it's the portfolio we have, the investment Molloy has made in go-to-market, the refresh that Mahesh is doing on mobile video. Yes, I do think NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, for the federal government is a beneficial tailwind. Jack talked about on the last call, we were targeting $330 million of the overall fixed video and access control category to be yielded from government customers. We actually exceeded that. It was closer to slightly above $350 million. So yes, I think we will continue to take share and grow our business in the government vertical. But I also think we'll take it -- continue to take share in commercial enterprise as well.\nJohn Molloy: One other thing I'd feather in, Greg, just is we talked about our Pelco acquisition and what that meant in terms of bringing federal government contracts, and we actually have invested in a refresh of that portfolio, which I think will be critically important for our federal government business. It dovetails with all things NDAA Secure Communications Act in 2022 and beyond.\nJason Winkler: And Greg, just to clarify, the $350 million number you mentioned is both mobile and fixed video...\nGregory Brown: Total. That's right.\nJohn Molloy: Into government. It serves all of the great portfolio. Mahesh has around mobile and in-car, complemented by fixed video, a market that was nascent for Avigilon just 3 years ago. So it's been a good market for us and continue to be.\nMichael DiPalma: Great. And Greg, you also mentioned accelerating demand like during the fourth quarter. Was there any particular end customer for which the demand was the most pronounced? Such as -- like are you seeing the most demand from like local and state, like law enforcement customers? Or is it from the federal government or commercial? I was just wondering if you could parse out where you're seeing the strongest demand.\nGregory Brown: I think we entered Q4 with strong demand. And then it got -- it did accelerate in Q4. The end user that I would highlight is probably the public safety customers for APX NEXT. We had high expectations. We've spent a lot of time improving, refreshing the APX NEXT that Jack has referenced. Orders and demand increased. It was outstanding in Q4. And we also introduced the APX XN fire radio. We have plans to introduce a mid-tier APX NEXT. And if I were to highlight, Louie, 1 area, although demand was fairly broad, I would highlight the APX NEXT public safety users in North America. And as Jack's already referenced, I think we're in the early innings of that APX NEXT refresh cycle.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Silverstein with Cowen.\nPaul Silverstein: I don't think I heard you all say it. I apologize if you did, but Greg, Jason, can you tell us what growth -- how much of growth is being taken away by supply chain? What would growth look like in '22 buffer supply chain?\nGregory Brown: Well, I would say this. So we talked about overall demand being strong. It accelerated in Q4. Paul, you know we ended the year with record backlog. We're providing full year revenue guidance of 7%. That is in the context of semiconductor constraints that we think will be throughout most of 2022. It also is guidance that incorporates a $60 million headwind for FX. So we certainly don't have any demand problem in this environment. It's a supply-constrained environment.  And when I think about, look, how much better could it be, look, I think if supply was more free flowing, I think we could have growth in 2022 that wouldn't be too much dissimilar from the year we just completed. So demand is strong. And we're navigating it, and we're -- I'm pleased with the execution that the team is doing.  As we look at supply, yes, we're buying broker parts at higher cost. We're looking for substitute alternatives. Molloy and Scott Mottonen on the engineering side are doing real-time product design, redesign work. That takes a little bit of time. We're carrying longer, higher inventory. We are entering into longer-term supply agreements where we can with certain semiconductor providers. So I think we're doing a lot in parallel, but demand is strong.\nPaul Silverstein: Greg, to be clear, I'm not questioning that demand is strong. I was just hoping you get quantification. But I hear you saying that growth this year could look like 10% buffer supply constraints. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think that's what I just heard you say.\nGregory Brown: I would say not too dissimilar from last year. So you could take that within the contours of that. But clearly, it's stronger than 7% and the $60 million of headwind with FX. But yes, Paul, I think you're absolutely directionally on it.\nPaul Silverstein: I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up, I apologize if you [indiscernible] previously. But on the Hytera question specifically, and I know I'm asking to speculate here, but given that it's now a criminal action and a thought arises that I suspect that could shut them down or effectively shut them down throughout the U.S. and perhaps in other regions outside of China as well. Any thoughts on how good the -- and I recognize it's going to take time. It's not going to happen overnight. But if that criminal action proceeds, it ends up in the same place as civil action did, what could be the impact to your business from a revenue growth and profitability standpoint?\nGregory Brown: Well, first of all, I was happy to see the DOJ earlier this week announced 21 count criminal indictment of Hytera for conspiracy. It is separate than our civil actions. It doesn't change our strategy on the pending civil litigation, Paul. And now as a result of a series of judgments, they owe us in excess of $670 million, separate from the criminal actions that the DOJ just announced. They are effectively shut down in the U.S. and Australia and Germany. I think this will put incrementally more pressure on them.  Look, we're in a multiyear campaign. There's nothing more important, nothing, Paul, than our intellectual property and the innovation that we invest in. We will continue to defend it. We will fiercely continue to pursue collection. I don't mind spending the money and we'll do what we need to do to get appropriate remuneration back from Hytera. It was a very concerted multiyear campaign where they stole, and we're going to get them to pay for it.  I like the fact that the DOJ announced their criminal indictment, but I look at that as kind of 2 different parallel streams and doesn't interfere with our focus and perseverance and determination around our civil litigation.\nPaul Silverstein: Greg, just to be clear to your comment, you're saying independent of the criminal action, based on the outcome of the civil litigation, if I recall, I think the damages were reduced to $545 million, but you've got a very hefty royalty stream in perpetuity. You're telling us that, that royalty stream and the damages will effectively shut Hytera down, including the PCR market, whether or not that criminal investigation yields a verdict against Hytera.\nGregory Brown: I think that our actual judgments are over $670 million when you add in attorney's fees and prejudgment interest and trial costs and so on. I think -- I'm just saying in the main, Paul, I think the pressure on this company is so great. In the U.S., I'd be surprised if they're able to continue to operate going forward. We'll see, but we're going to pursue all of our collections. And if it includes asset seizure, we'll do that, too. But we're not going to let people, anybody, steal our product or trade secrets or intellectual property.\nPaul Silverstein: As it should be. Good for you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse.\nAhmed Badri: Thank you, by the way, for all the color on the various elements on the questions that were asked earlier. The couple of questions I have is, when you think about pricing for your products, and I'm referring mainly to LMR, what is the average price increase that you guys are thinking about to put into the actual list pricing of LMR products? So maybe we'll start off there.\nJason Winkler: Sure. So we've been looking at the portfolio and implementing surgical adjustments through Q3 and Q4. It really depends on the portfolio and how we stack up competitively. We've been adjusting not only list prices, but also discount management and programs, which can also yield higher sales and lower discounts. It's tough to put a number on it in aggregate. It's going to be an improvement and a real help to offset the costs that we talked about in the second half. So the series of actions in aggregate that we put together will offset a large part of the pricing of the cost increases that we mentioned incrementally. That's why the bulk of the $120 million of increased semiconductor costs is in the first half, $100 million of it. $20 million of it is in the second half, and that's in part because of the actions we put in place.\nAhmed Badri: So just safe to assume that the minimum price increases will offset the increases in costs, the surgical costs. That's like your -- that's the standard base case, right, the floor. And then this doesn't take into account if customers are opting into order in APX NEXT, which is technically a much higher ASP radio compared to the rest of the portfolio. Is that the right way to think about what's going on?\nJason Winkler: So mix changes in the portfolio enhancements we make, like APX NEXT, are contemplated as we plan any given year, right? And in the mid-tier APX NEXT that Greg mentioned that's coming into the portfolio, that may come at a price premium to its successor, is factored into our base case. The price increases that we're referring to are in the -- incremental to that around prices of products that perhaps are more aged and not new products, but rather products that have been in the market for a bit. We've looked at that across the portfolio with Jack's team around the elasticity of our entire portfolio.\nAhmed Badri: Got it. Got it. So 1 last question. When I think about the 7% number you're guiding to for 2022, how much of that is price increases? And how much of that is units and volume being shipped?\nJason Winkler: The majority of that, of the 7% growth is volume increases.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.\nBenjamin Bollin: Greg, I wanted to start with a question around America Rescue Plan Act. And specifically, I'm curious your thoughts about how you look at the incrementality of that funding versus maybe what was already a strong steady state budget? And then the second part, maybe for Jack, also America Rescue Plan Act-related, any behavior you're seeing from customers where you think they are in figuring out where they're going to spend this money, how much they've got, relative size of projects? Any color around that would be helpful.\nGregory Brown: Yes, Ben, I would actually say, and I think Jack referenced this earlier, I think there is a strong steady state to begin with around these budgets before you get to Recovery Act money. I think that the narrative a year ago was deep on the police. I think we've seen a reversal of that hyperbole politically, but we're also seeing more and more investment. People know that they need investment and more modern and secure infrastructure to protect these communities. And we're seeing that across the board. So I think steady state is stronger. I think the sentiment around police investment is different than it was several quarters ago, and then you layer on ARPA.\nJohn Molloy: And so, Ben, as we talked about, ARPA is a multiyear -- it's multiyear in terms of how we'll draw down that money. I want to point out, there was important clarification that was directed by the United States Treasury Department in early January. They issued a final guidance, which was actually a few hundred pages long. That guidance, and this is really important, they made several references to how that money was to be used, namely law enforcement equipment technology and there are various different caveats, but that was very important. Pointed to things like P25 infrastructure, P25 devices that those funding were able to be pointed towards, obviously, the products that we make.  So I think that was very beneficial. But again, as I said, I think it's one thing to have the funding, but it's more important to have the portfolio that resonates to them. And I think as we've said across the 3 technology segments, we're the market leader, and we believe we're taking share.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Chung with JPMorgan.\nPaul Chung: So just a quick one from me on gross margin. So nice performance here to end the year kind of despite some freight costs. You mentioned kind of flattish '22 margin performance maybe on some of these lingering freight. But as we look out to '23, hopefully, these costs come down, some product mix benefits kind of continue and then these price increases hold. So can we see a gross margin step-up in '23 based on those trends?\nJason Winkler: Sure. So the $120 million that is incremental that we've been talking about on this call regarding supply lines for semiconductors is not a structural. It's temporary. We're having to pay a premium because the available supply from the committed suppliers isn't necessarily there. And so as a result, we're paying a premium, a markup, if you will, competing in the open market for other manufacturers who need the same part.  So as we think about what happens to those costs over time, hence, the market and semiconductor manufacturers, all of whom are working to increase capacity, all of whom are working to fulfill our needs, and we have excellent relationships with the suppliers that we're navigating through this journey with, as those things improve, those costs get mitigated.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citi.\nJames Suva: Greg, you mentioned that kind of steady state or continual demand remains pretty strong. And then when we add in the additional government stimulus like AARP, the American Rescue Plan and such, I'm wondering, are we reaching a point now where first responders are looking at some major changes like to their command centers? It seems like from a lot of the work that we do, that the command centers are pretty antiquated, out of date and could be a lot more technologically advanced, informative and helpful. And I'm just wondering, those are big decisions to make, almost like new whiteboard stuff and put in completely new systems. I'm wondering, does this give us kind of over that hump or over that worry or concern to where now they can actually implement even more effective tools in command centers?\nGregory Brown: I think, Jim, the high-level answer is yes because it fuels overall demand and funds for those changes. But you also know that command center is software and their existing tools is one that embeds existing inertia and workflows. And it's actually -- yes, it's available funding that can fund those transitions, but it's also the reinvention on transformation of employee, public habits and workflow that's more embedded.  So I still think it will take time. Sales cycles are a little bit longer. And as we do that, as Mahesh and Jack talked about last time, we're looking to move more sales along a hybrid strategy of meeting customers where they are so it could be a prem solution. It could be a SaaS subscription solution. But as we sell more of those transitions, we expect it to be more of a annual recurring revenue and less of a CapEx purchase, which will elongate kind of the revenue recognition over time. And clearly, it's a positive, though. Mahesh, did you want to add something? No. Okay. Jack? No. Okay.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks.\nGregory Brown: Again, thank you for joining us this afternoon. For all of the Motorola people listening, I want to thank you for not just your perseverance during a challenging Q4 with Omicron and additional supply constraints, but for the whole year. You've been unwavering, and you've allowed us and fueled our capability to achieve a lot of the record results that we talked about this afternoon.  Demand is strong. As I mentioned, it got stronger in Q4, and we're very proud of the fact that we ended the year with record backlog. The funding environment, which we just talked about, again, it just remains exceptional. We're growing and taking share in all 3 technologies. By the way, our total Software business in 2021 is approaching $1 billion, if you count all software. And we expect it to exceed $1 billion in 2022. And even with the $120 million of incremental material semiconductor costs and $60 million of FX headwinds, we still expect to grow approximately 7% and expand operating margins as well.  Conditions like this, while challenging, also present great opportunities, inorganic and organic. And with our balance sheet, our firepower, we have every intention of deploying capital strategically, surgically, but to continue to drive significant shareholder value creation.  I appreciate everybody on the call. And to all the Motorolans, I'm really proud of you and grateful for everything you're doing.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the Internet in approximately 3 hours. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Our Q4 results included revenue of $2.3 billion, up 2%, including $10 million from acquisitions and $6 million from favorable currency. GAAP operating earnings of $549 million and operating margins of 23.7% compared to 24.4% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $670 million, up $3 million. And non-GAAP operating margins of 28.9%, down 40 basis points due to higher operating expenses for employee incentive compensation and acquisitions.  Operating margin in Products and Systems Integration was down 170 basis points due to lower sales and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher sales and improved operating leverage in the Software and Services segment. GAAP earnings per share of $2.30 compared to $2.37 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.85 versus $2.86 last year with higher sales and improved operating leverage in Software and Services, offset by, within the Products and Systems Integration segment, higher OpEx related to incentives and acquisitions, along with lower sales. OpEx in Q4 was $518 million, up $26 million versus last year, primarily due to higher employee incentive compensation and acquisitions. The Q4 effective tax rate was 22.3% compared to 21% in the prior year.  For the full year of 2021, revenue was $8.2 billion, up 10%, with growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. Revenue from acquisitions was $120 million and the FX impact was $130 million favorable during the year. GAAP operating earnings were $1.7 billion or 20.4% of sales versus 18.7% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.1 billion, up $282 million. And non-GAAP operating margins were 25.9% of sales, up from 24.8% of sales in the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. This increase in profitability also includes $100 million of higher employee incentive compensation earned in 2021.  GAAP earnings per share was $7.17 compared to $5.45 in the prior year, driven by higher sales, improved leverage, higher other income and lower reorganization charges in the current year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $9.15, up 19% from $7.69 in 2020 on higher sales, higher operating earnings, higher other income, which was partially offset by a higher tax rate.  For the full year, OpEx was $1.9 billion, up $123 million versus last year, primarily driven by higher employee incentive compensation and acquisitions. And the effective tax rate for 2021 was 21% compared to 20% in the prior year on higher benefits from discrete items, including the benefits of stock comp expense booked in the prior year.  Turning to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $703 million, flat versus the prior year. And free cash flow was $635 million versus $637 million in the prior year. And for the full year, OCF was a record $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year, and free cash flow was a record $1.6 billion versus $1.4 billion in the prior year. The increase in cash flow was driven by higher sales, higher earnings and partially offset by higher cash taxes.  Capital allocation for 2021 included $528 million of share repurchases at an average price of $208.41, $482 million in cash dividends and $457 million for acquisitions. Additionally, during the year, we issued $850 million of new long-term debt, redeemed $324 million of outstanding debt, entered into a new upsized $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and ended the year with $1.9 billion of cash and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of only 1.6. We also increased our dividend 11%, our 11th consecutive year of a double-digit increase, and we announced a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program in the second quarter.  Moving to our segment results. Q4 Products and System Integration sales were $1.5 billion, down 1%, which was impacted by the supply constraints we discussed on the last call. Growth in video security and public safety LMR was offset by a decline in PCR. And revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $4 million. Operating earnings were $378 million or 25.3% of sales, down from 27% in the prior year, driven by higher employee incentive compensation and lower sales.  Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include a $98 million P25 upgrade for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, $94 million of APX NEXT device orders in North America, a $68 million P25 device upgrade for the District of Columbia, a $28 million P25 upgrade for a large U.S. customer, a $21 million fixed video security order for a large North America utility customer, a $19 million additional TETRA order from the German MOD and a $17 million TETRA device upgrade for a customer in Asia Pacific. And for the full year, revenue was $5 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by higher sales of LMR and higher sales of video security.  Revenue from acquisitions was $89 million. Operating earnings were $976 million or 19.4% of sales, up from 19% in the prior year on higher sales, partially offset by higher OpEx.  Moving next to our Software and Services segment. Q4 revenue was $824 million, up 8% from last year, driven by growth in LMR services, video security software and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $6 million. Operating earnings were $292 million or 35.4% of sales, up 150 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and improved leverage.  Some notable Q4 wins in this segment include a $25 million P25 multiyear services contract with Cook County, Illinois, a $17 million P25 multiyear software upgrade agreement for ICI Systems Authority in California, a $17 million body-worn camera as a service order for the City of Houston, Texas police department, a $15 million P25 multiyear software upgrade for Orange County, California and a $14 million additional body-worn camera order for the French MOI, a $11 million command center software hybrid cloud order for North Carolina Department of Public Safety, and we saw a 27% growth in software for video security and access control.  For the full year, revenue was $3.1 billion, up 13% on growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions was $31 million. Operating earnings were $1.1 billion or 36.4% of sales, up 210 basis points versus the prior year, driven by higher sales and improved leverage.  Looking at regional results. North America Q4 revenue was $1.6 billion, up 4% on growth in video security and LMR products and services. For the full year, North America revenue was $5.6 billion, up 11%, with growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. International Q4 was $705 million, down 3% due to a decline in LMR, partially offset with growth in video security and command center software. We saw growth in Latin America during the quarter, while EMEA was flat and Asia Pac declined. For the full year, international revenue was $2.6 billion, up 9%, with growth in both segments and across all 3 technologies. Revenue was up in EMEA and Latin America, offset by a slight decline in Asia Pac.  Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog was a record $13.6 billion, up $2.2 billion compared to last year, driven by the U.K. Home Office's exercise of their contractual right to extend the Airwave network 4 years through 2026, along with record LMR product orders and growth in Software and Services contracts in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $2.2 billion, driven by the Airwave extension and record LMR product orders in North America during the fourth quarter.  Software and Services backlog was up $1.3 billion compared to last year and up $1.8 billion sequentially, driven by the Airwave extension and growth in Software and Services agreements in North America. Products and SI backlog was up $886 million compared to last year, driven by record LMR orders. Sequentially, backlog was up $417 million, driven by record LMR orders in North America during the fourth quarter.  Turning next to our outlook for 2022. For the full year, we expect sales to be up approximately 7%, with mid-single-digit growth in products and systems integration and approximately 10% growth in Software and Services. And we expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share between $9.80 and $9.95. This outlook assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 21% to 22%. It also assumes $120 million of higher material costs, largely driven by the current semiconductor market dynamics of limited supply and us procuring available parts at a premium from other secondary markets. Additionally, we expect pricing adjustments to our portfolio, which we've recently made to take effect as we progress in fulfilling existing backlog.  For Q1, we expect sales to be up approximately 3%, with non-GAAP EPS between $1.53 and $1.59 per share, inclusive of $50 million of the incremental material costs I referenced for the year. It also assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count between 173 million and 174 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 17%.  We expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion. This OCF outlook include $75 million of higher employee incentive payments earned in 2021 and $150 million of higher cash taxes, half of which is driven by the U.S. federal tax requirement to capitalize R&D beginning in 2022. And for the full year, we will continue to be diligent in our cost management. We expect OpEx to be up approximately $100 million from last year, driven by investments in video security and command center software, inclusive of $40 million related to recent acquisitions.  I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. And on PCR, even with the supply constraints on the year that it had, it grew in 2021 9% to just over $800 million. So despite the supply chain and backlog in that PCR space that were yet to deliver, it grew 9%. I'd also point to the services of our backlog is -- as the largest part of our backlog. And within it, our multiyear services contracts, many of them do have a pricing mechanism around price escalation. So Services and Software has a little bit of a hedge there on parts of the business. So the bulk of our backlog, again, is direct customers, their public safety in nature. They order when they need things, and we're prioritizing them. We do have a channels business as well, record low inventory levels among the channel. And we're prioritizing the demand signal from them, which we believe to be very clean. So in terms of pull forward and pricing strategies, we've been adjusting price for a number of quarters, and our backlog has been largely unaffected. The bulk of the $50 million is related to our supply lines around semiconductor, which are embedded in the products, primarily LMR. So the bulk of that $50 million or that $50 million is within the Products segment. The supply chain environment is challenging on the front, Keith, of freight being elevated, which we talked about and most companies are having to navigate those higher prices. The material cost drivers that we've highlighted as incremental this year are entirely around obtaining supply for semiconductors. There are other general price pressures within supply chain, but we are mitigating those. They are not the key challenge that we have. We've navigated those. It's really freight and it's semiconductors.  We have a higher inventory position, too, Keith, I'll point you to on the balance sheet, nearing $800 million of inventory. So we're creating a buffer for the other categories of parts beyond semiconductors so that when the available semiconductors are delivered, that we have the right matching of componentry. So I'd say our key challenges and continuing are around supply chain of semis. It's both. Our demand has increased, but our original demand signal has not been delivered. We've had delivery delays from a handful of semiconductor suppliers. That's in part what we pointed to and what's driving the incremental costs of $120 million this year. Jack, maybe you can talk about the funnel development. But in terms of it -- it's implied in the both products growth and SNS growth for the year. And Greg, just to clarify, the $350 million number you mentioned is both mobile and fixed video... Sure. So we've been looking at the portfolio and implementing surgical adjustments through Q3 and Q4. It really depends on the portfolio and how we stack up competitively. We've been adjusting not only list prices, but also discount management and programs, which can also yield higher sales and lower discounts. It's tough to put a number on it in aggregate. It's going to be an improvement and a real help to offset the costs that we talked about in the second half. So the series of actions in aggregate that we put together will offset a large part of the pricing of the cost increases that we mentioned incrementally. That's why the bulk of the $120 million of increased semiconductor costs is in the first half, $100 million of it. $20 million of it is in the second half, and that's in part because of the actions we put in place. So mix changes in the portfolio enhancements we make, like APX NEXT, are contemplated as we plan any given year, right? And in the mid-tier APX NEXT that Greg mentioned that's coming into the portfolio, that may come at a price premium to its successor, is factored into our base case. The price increases that we're referring to are in the -- incremental to that around prices of products that perhaps are more aged and not new products, but rather products that have been in the market for a bit. We've looked at that across the portfolio with Jack's team around the elasticity of our entire portfolio. The majority of that, of the 7% growth is volume increases. Sure. So the $120 million that is incremental that we've been talking about on this call regarding supply lines for semiconductors is not a structural. It's temporary. We're having to pay a premium because the available supply from the committed suppliers isn't necessarily there. And so as a result, we're paying a premium, a markup, if you will, competing in the open market for other manufacturers who need the same part.  So as we think about what happens to those costs over time, hence, the market and semiconductor manufacturers, all of whom are working to increase capacity, all of whom are working to fulfill our needs, and we have excellent relationships with the suppliers that we're navigating through this journey with, as those things improve, those costs get mitigated."

            "name": "John Molloy",
            "content": "Sure, Erik. It's Jack. So you're correct. When we originally acquired WatchGuard a few years back, they had had some quality issues with Houston. We put the full team's focus on improving the quality, both from a back-end standpoint as well as from a device standpoint. We've also pivoting our offer in the body-worn space to an as a service offer, and we think that was compelling for the City of Houston.  At the end of the day, we've got long-standing and broad relationships with the City of Houston. I think they trusted us as MSI, as Motorola Solutions to come and fix the appropriate quality issues as we have throughout our history. And I think we're going to have a real happy customer there.  As it relates to body worn in general, it's probably also important to highlight that for the full year, our orders more than doubled. Q4 '21 was a record orders quarter for us. And I'd also highlight that moving forward, we're really well positioned for growth internationally. We think that, in general, the market has wanted an alternative. And as Greg said, we believe we're taking share both domestically and internationally in the body-worn space. And Jason, we obviously track canceled orders, and canceled orders have been de minimis throughout the 2021. Sure, George. So maybe to start, from a CARES perspective, in 2021, we had about $50 million last year in CARES. And really, the conversations have pivoted to the American rescue plan. As we highlighted, $350 billion available to state and local and then $170 billion available to schools, which is, interestingly enough, one of our biggest vertical solutions for video security and access control. So the funding environment, not only from a stimulus perspective, but actually from a state and local budgets and receipts perspective, has been as good as we've ever seen in my -- really in the history of my business.  But probably more importantly, Jason highlighted it, Greg highlighted it, it's making sure that we've got the attractive portfolio to meet to do that. And so things like APX NEXT and device refresh from an LMR perspective, things like driving new camera portfolio, investing in analytics and AI and the video security, I think, have positioned and married well with the stimulus opportunities, which is what you're seeing in backlog and I think future demand. Yes. And I think we look at -- we track our ARP funding as well and the pipeline to start '22 just to mentalize it over '21 is up. But again, I think it's more important -- I think equally as important as the stimulus funding is just the condition of state and local budgets in general. One other thing I'd feather in, Greg, just is we talked about our Pelco acquisition and what that meant in terms of bringing federal government contracts, and we actually have invested in a refresh of that portfolio, which I think will be critically important for our federal government business. It dovetails with all things NDAA Secure Communications Act in 2022 and beyond. Into government. It serves all of the great portfolio. Mahesh has around mobile and in-car, complemented by fixed video, a market that was nascent for Avigilon just 3 years ago. So it's been a good market for us and continue to be. And so, Ben, as we talked about, ARPA is a multiyear -- it's multiyear in terms of how we'll draw down that money. I want to point out, there was important clarification that was directed by the United States Treasury Department in early January. They issued a final guidance, which was actually a few hundred pages long. That guidance, and this is really important, they made several references to how that money was to be used, namely law enforcement equipment technology and there are various different caveats, but that was very important.

            "name": "Gregory Brown",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook.  First, I'm very pleased with our performance during the quarter and, in particular, our ability to navigate the current supply chain environment to deliver the critical solutions that our customers rely on every day. We achieved revenue at the higher end of our guidance and earnings per share above our guidance, ended the year with record backlog of $13.6 billion, up 19% versus last year, and generated $703 million of operating cash flow during the quarter and a record $1.8 billion for the full year.  Second, our full year results exemplify the strength and durability of our business and highlight our ability to leverage our large installed base to sell more value-add software and services. For the year, the Software and Services segment grew 13%, expanded operating margins by 210 basis points and accounted for 38% of total sales and 54% of total operating earnings for the company. Additionally, revenue was up double digits in all 3 technologies in the segment, led by 39% growth in video security and access control software, which resulted in approximately $400 million for that category of revenue for the year.  And finally, looking ahead to this year, our record backlog and continued demand are informing our expectations for another year of strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth, with growth in both segments despite the ongoing and fluid supply chain challenges.  At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thanks, Jason. Let me just end this piece with a few additional thoughts. First, 2021 was an outstanding year for our company. We achieved record orders, sales, earnings and cash flow. We increased backlog, $2.2 billion. And we returned approximately $1 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Additionally, we continue to invest in our video security and command center software offerings with the acquisitions of Openpath, Envysion and 911 Data Master.  Second, I'd like to provide you with a little bit more color on what we're currently seeing with supply and demand and how that impacts our current 2022 expectations. Demand across all 3 technologies was incredibly strong in 2021. In fact, it even accelerated in Q4. Like many companies, procuring semiconductor supply to meet our increasing demand has been challenging, and the environment in Q4 was even further impacted with supplier delays and the impact of the Omicron variant. In particular, delays from some semiconductor suppliers required us, as Jason just referenced, to substitute parts from alternative sources at higher costs, and this will impact margins for Q1 and Q2.  For the full year, we still expect solid revenue growth in the Products segment, driven by both video security and LMR products, inclusive of PCR. We've taken a careful look at our portfolio and made further pricing adjustments that we anticipate will take effect in the second half of the year and lead to 2022 full year gross margins that will be comparable and operating margins that will be slightly higher year-over-year.  Third, I'm really pleased with our position for growth. The funding environment for our customers continues to remain exceptionally strong. Our APX NEXT refresh cycle is gaining traction with our public safety customers with almost $100 million in Q4 orders alone. We continue to capture market share in our video security and command center software businesses and our recurring revenues continue to grow. And our balance sheet is stronger than ever, which allows us to be opportunistic in our deployment of capital in this current environment.  And finally, I'd like to just recognize all of the Motorola employees around the world who, despite the pandemic, have never wavered in their commitment to our customers and also in giving back. Last year, our foundation donated more than $12 million to charitable organizations, and our employees volunteered a record 65,000 hours in more than 40 countries. I'm incredibly proud of their efforts and of the recognition we continue to receive. We were recently named again to Fortune's Most Admired Companies and as one of the 100 Best ESG companies by Investor's Business Daily.  I'm also really pleased with our recent announcement that Dr. Ayanna Howard will be joining our Board. Her perspective and experience in AI and robotics will be invaluable as we continue advancing these technologies that deliver public safety and enterprise security.  I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and welcome your questions. Sure. Thanks, Tim. We were pleased about the extension of Airwave. The U.K. Home Office exercised their contractual right in December to extend it by 4 years to the end of 2026. Obviously, we welcome that. We think that's good news. We also think that's a continuing reflection of the criticality and the importance of what that network does for British first responders.  It was extended at contractual existing pricing. And having said that, we also, in parallel, continue to work with the Competition Markets Authority as they continue to progress with their investigation. We're actively engaged with them. And I think by their own time line, the CMA expects to conclude their work by, I think, sometime in the summer or the mid or end of summer, and we would update you accordingly. But we obviously feel good about this development, and we're very proud of the resilience and the investment we continue to make in Airwave. Yes, Tim. I'm really pleased with the execution by Jack Molloy and John Kedzierski and Mahesh in our full Video Security and Access Control business. For the year, the category -- the technology category grew 32%, 21% organic, which I think is great. And for 2022, our outlook is and expectation is for video security and access control to grow approximately 20%.  When we look at the category in total, we think that market in the main is probably growing 7% or 8%. So the good news is we continue to take share. We've taken share in 2021. We can -- I believe we'll take share again in 2022. We're getting really good traction in the government vertical, which Avigilon had a very nascent presence in. We're updating and refreshing the product portfolio, both on fixed video, and of course, we acquired Pelco and Indigo Vision. We've refreshed the camera portfolio. We're doing more investment in software and analytics. Mahesh is leading the refresh around in-car and body-worn camera. And I'm also very pleased with the Openpath acquisition we did earlier.  I like our execution. The addressable market in 2022 is now, we believe, $18 billion, $3 billion larger than last year. We're taking share. We're growing and I like our outlook. Yes, Erik, we -- the incremental material semiconductor costs of $120 million for all of '22 is primarily LMR, which is inclusive of PCR. There's also some video in there as well, but we expect the incremental material semiconductor cost to be about $50 million in Q1, $50 million in Q2 and $20 million in the back half as we make progress fulfilling backlog and we have taken additional pricing increases. As the year progresses, our leverage will improve from a P&L and operating earnings standpoint. Yes. I think pricing and backlog is largely fixed and cannot be repriced. I think that's informing the guide we're giving you both for the full year and the linearity of the impact of margins of Q1 and Q2 primarily. But the backlog is as strong as I've ever seen it. And even if you take the extension of Airwave out, it also was still really strong in LMR and PCR as well. Good point, Jason. Yes. The other thing to note is, as you know, this ARPA money is multiyear in duration. So the $350 billion that Jack talked about, the $170 billion, and there's more, some of this multiyear funding goes all the way out to the end of 2024. When you take that visibility of funding, in addition to state and local tax receipts being robust, and then you combine some of the other regulatory things around NDAA, but also more recently, the Secure Equipment Act where the FCC has been directed to direct certain Chinese companies and prevent them from competing like Hytera in LMR or Hikvision in Dahua for fixed video for state and local opportunities in the U.S., that's an incremental benefit as well. So the environment is strong. Yes, Louie, thank you. I think our growth is coming for a variety of reasons. I think it's the portfolio we have, the investment Molloy has made in go-to-market, the refresh that Mahesh is doing on mobile video. Yes, I do think NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, for the federal government is a beneficial tailwind. Jack talked about on the last call, we were targeting $330 million of the overall fixed video and access control category to be yielded from government customers. We actually exceeded that. It was closer to slightly above $350 million. So yes, I think we will continue to take share and grow our business in the government vertical. But I also think we'll take it -- continue to take share in commercial enterprise as well. Total. That's right. I think we entered Q4 with strong demand. And then it got -- it did accelerate in Q4. The end user that I would highlight is probably the public safety customers for APX NEXT. We had high expectations. We've spent a lot of time improving, refreshing the APX NEXT that Jack has referenced. Orders and demand increased. It was outstanding in Q4. And we also introduced the APX XN fire radio. We have plans to introduce a mid-tier APX NEXT. And if I were to highlight, Louie, 1 area, although demand was fairly broad, I would highlight the APX NEXT public safety users in North America. And as Jack's already referenced, I think we're in the early innings of that APX NEXT refresh cycle. Well, I would say this. So we talked about overall demand being strong. It accelerated in Q4. Paul, you know we ended the year with record backlog. We're providing full year revenue guidance of 7%. That is in the context of semiconductor constraints that we think will be throughout most of 2022. It also is guidance that incorporates a $60 million headwind for FX. So we certainly don't have any demand problem in this environment. It's a supply-constrained environment.  And when I think about, look, how much better could it be, look, I think if supply was more free flowing, I think we could have growth in 2022 that wouldn't be too much dissimilar from the year we just completed. So demand is strong. And we're navigating it, and we're -- I'm pleased with the execution that the team is doing.  As we look at supply, yes, we're buying broker parts at higher cost. We're looking for substitute alternatives. Molloy and Scott Mottonen on the engineering side are doing real-time product design, redesign work. That takes a little bit of time. We're carrying longer, higher inventory. We are entering into longer-term supply agreements where we can with certain semiconductor providers. So I think we're doing a lot in parallel, but demand is strong. I would say not too dissimilar from last year. So you could take that within the contours of that. But clearly, it's stronger than 7% and the $60 million of headwind with FX. But yes, Paul, I think you're absolutely directionally on it. Well, first of all, I was happy to see the DOJ earlier this week announced 21 count criminal indictment of Hytera for conspiracy. It is separate than our civil actions. It doesn't change our strategy on the pending civil litigation, Paul. And now as a result of a series of judgments, they owe us in excess of $670 million, separate from the criminal actions that the DOJ just announced. They are effectively shut down in the U.S. and Australia and Germany. I think this will put incrementally more pressure on them.  Look, we're in a multiyear campaign. There's nothing more important, nothing, Paul, than our intellectual property and the innovation that we invest in. We will continue to defend it. We will fiercely continue to pursue collection. I don't mind spending the money and we'll do what we need to do to get appropriate remuneration back from Hytera. It was a very concerted multiyear campaign where they stole, and we're going to get them to pay for it.  I like the fact that the DOJ announced their criminal indictment, but I look at that as kind of 2 different parallel streams and doesn't interfere with our focus and perseverance and determination around our civil litigation. I think that our actual judgments are over $670 million when you add in attorney's fees and prejudgment interest and trial costs and so on. I think -- I'm just saying in the main, Paul, I think the pressure on this company is so great. In the U.S., I'd be surprised if they're able to continue to operate going forward. We'll see, but we're going to pursue all of our collections. And if it includes asset seizure, we'll do that, too. But we're not going to let people, anybody, steal our product or trade secrets or intellectual property. Yes, Ben, I would actually say, and I think Jack referenced this earlier, I think there is a strong steady state to begin with around these budgets before you get to Recovery Act money. I think that the narrative a year ago was deep on the police. I think we've seen a reversal of that hyperbole politically, but we're also seeing more and more investment. People know that they need investment and more modern and secure infrastructure to protect these communities. And we're seeing that across the board. So I think steady state is stronger. I think the sentiment around police investment is different than it was several quarters ago, and then you layer on ARPA. I think, Jim, the high-level answer is yes because it fuels overall demand and funds for those changes. But you also know that command center is software and their existing tools is one that embeds existing inertia and workflows. And it's actually -- yes, it's available funding that can fund those transitions, but it's also the reinvention on transformation of employee, public habits and workflow that's more embedded.  So I still think it will take time. Sales cycles are a little bit longer. And as we do that, as Mahesh and Jack talked about last time, we're looking to move more sales along a hybrid strategy of meeting customers where they are so it could be a prem solution. It could be a SaaS subscription solution. But as we sell more of those transitions, we expect it to be more of a annual recurring revenue and less of a CapEx purchase, which will elongate kind of the revenue recognition over time. And clearly, it's a positive, though. Mahesh, did you want to add something? No. Okay. Jack? No. Okay. Again, thank you for joining us this afternoon. For all of the Motorola people listening, I want to thank you for not just your perseverance during a challenging Q4 with Omicron and additional supply constraints, but for the whole year. You've been unwavering, and you've allowed us and fueled our capability to achieve a lot of the record results that we talked about this afternoon.  Demand is strong. As I mentioned, it got stronger in Q4, and we're very proud of the fact that we ended the year with record backlog. The funding environment, which we just talked about, again, it just remains exceptional. We're growing and taking share in all 3 technologies. By the way, our total Software business in 2021 is approaching $1 billion, if you count all software. And we expect it to exceed $1 billion in 2022. And even with the $120 million of incremental material semiconductor costs and $60 million of FX headwinds, we still expect to grow approximately 7% and expand operating margins as well.  Conditions like this, while challenging, also present great opportunities, inorganic and organic. And with our balance sheet, our firepower, we have every intention of deploying capital strategically, surgically, but to continue to drive significant shareholder value creation.  I appreciate everybody on the call. And to all the Motorolans, I'm really proud of you and grateful for everything you're doing."

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks everybody for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook. First, Q3 results highlight the continued strong demand we're seeing across the business. We grew revenue 13%, earnings per share 21% and expanded operating margins by 150 basis points. Additionally, we ended the quarter with a record Q3 backlog of $11.4 billion, up 7% from last year. Second, we saw strong growth in all three technologies during the quarter. In LMR, revenue was up 11% while navigating a very challenging supply chain environment. In video security and access control revenue was up 26% driven by strong broad-based demand for both our fixed and mobile video offerings. And in command center software revenue was up 13% as we continue to expand within our existing install base and win new customers. And finally, based on our strong Q3 results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're again raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS. I'm now going to turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts.\nJason Winkler: Thanks, Greg. Our Q3 results included revenue of $2.1 billion up 13%, including $15 million from acquisitions and $25 million from favorable currency rates. GAAP operating earnings of $451 million and operating margins of 21.4% compared to 18.9% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $555 million, up $92 million or 20% from the year ago quarter. And non-GAAP operating margin was 26.3% of sales up from 24.8% driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage in both of our segments. GAAP earnings per share of $1.76 compared to $1.18 in the year ago quarter, the increase was primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage as well as a loss related to the refinancing of long-term debt that occurred in the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.35 compared to $1.95 last year, primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margin and improved operating leverage again in both segments. OpEx in Q3 was $496 million, up $41 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation related to incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions. Turning to cash flow, Q3 operating cash flow was $376 million compared with $392 million in the prior year while free cash flow was $315 million compared with $343 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to an increase in working capital inclusive of our higher inventory, partially offset by higher earnings. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $1.1 billion up $225 million compared with last year and free cash flow was $959 million, up $201 million over last year. The increase in cash flow year-to-date was primarily driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid during this year. Our capital allocation in Q3 included $137 million in share repurchases at an average price of $234.18, $120 million in cash dividends and $61 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million. We invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolv, whose technology powers are concealed weapons detection solution, and subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Envysion, a leader in enterprise video security and business analytics for $124 million net of cash. Moving next to our segment results, Q3 products and system integration sales were $1.3 billion up 14% driven by strong growth in LMR and video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $12 million. Operating earnings were $273 million or 20.6% of sales up from 18.9% in the year prior on higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in this segment include $72 million of P25 orders from a large U.S. federal customer, a $70 million TETRA order from the German Navy, a $45 million TETRA upgrade from a large EMEA customer, a $43 million P25 order from a large North America customer, a $22 million P25 upgrade from Metro S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil. And also during the quarter, we grew our video security and access control product revenue by 23%. Moving to the software and services segment, Q3 revenue was $782 million, up 11% from last year driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $3 million. Operating earnings were $282 million or 36% of sales, up 140 basis points from last year driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved OpEx leverage. Within this segment, some notable Q3 wins included a $41 million command center software contract with a large U.S. state and local customer, $31 million P25 multi-year extension with a customer in North America, a $17 million Push-to-Talk over broadband multi-year renewal with a large U.S. customer, a $7 million CommandCentral suite and video security order with the City of Yonkers, New York, which expanded off of a prior body-worn camera win. During the quarter, we grew our video security and access control software revenue by 32%. Additionally, we launched the M500, the first in-car video system enabled by artificial intelligence. Moving next to our regional results. Q3 North America revenue was $1.4 billion, up 14% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software. International Q3 revenue was $658 million, up 10% also driven by LMR, video security and command center software. We saw strong growth in EMEA and Latin America during the quarter, while in Asia Pac, we continue to experience headwinds related to COVID-19 lockdowns in various countries. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q3 record of $11.4 billion, up $710 million compared to last year driven primarily by growth in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $144 million also driven primarily by growth in North America. Software and services backlog was up $6 million compared to last year driven by a $479 million increase in multi-year services and software contracts, partially offset by revenue recognition on AirWave and ESN over the last year. Sequentially, backlog was down $112 million driven primarily by revenue recognition for AirWave and ESN during the quarter, partially offset by growth in services and software contracts in North America. The products in SI backlog would up $704 million compared to last year and $256 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions. Turning next to our outlook. We now expect full year sales to be up 10% to 10.25% compared to our prior guide of 9.5% to 10%. And we now expect full year earnings per share between $9 and $9.04 per share, up from our prior guide of $8.88 to $8.98 per share. This increased outlook includes the video security and access control technology growing greater than 30%. It also includes our current view of supply chain conditions, FX at current spot rates and an effective tax rate of 21.5% along with a diluted share count of 174 million shares. And finally, we now expect full year OpEx to be $1.95 billion inclusive of our two latest acquisitions Openpath and Envysion. And we expect full year operating cash flow to be approximately $1.825 billion, up $25 million from our prior estimate. With that I'd like to now turn the call back over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Jason. I thought I would end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call and before we open it up for questions. But first, our results for the quarter were outstanding and I'm extremely proud of how the team is executing through a very tough supply chain environment. We achieved record Q3 sales, operating earnings and EPS, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points and finished the quarter with a record Q3 ending backlog. Second, I want to share some color on what we're actually seeing in the two segments. In products in SI demand for both our LMR and video security solutions remained robust, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in Q3 and record ending backlog. Supply chain constraints continue to impact our LMR business, and in particularly our PCR business, as demand outpaced our ability to obtain supply in Q3 and we expect we'll continue to do so in Q4. In software and services, we continue to see strong demand, which is driving revenue growth and improve profitability. In fact, as we finish the year, we now expect operating margin to increase by 200 basis points year-over-year for the segment. Our customers continue to increase their investment in our value-added services and in software, while we now expect command center software revenue growth to be low double digits. Our video security and access control software revenue growth will likely be greater than 35% this year and is the fastest growing area within our software portfolio. Finally, as I look ahead, I'm encouraged by how we're positioned. Our strong Q3 backlog in both segments provides us with significant demand visibility. We're expanding our relationships within our existing install base to provide more software and services. The customer funding is as good as I've seen it, and our NDAA compliant manufacturing in North America is providing a key differentiator for our fixed video solutions, and while we expect the challenging supply chain environment to be with us through at least the first half of next year, we're still planning for another year of strong revenue earnings and cash flow growth in 2022. And I'll now turn the call back over to Tim.\nTim Yocum: Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please your mind our callers on the line how to ask a question?\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Maybe just one on the video and access control, obviously, 30% plus really strong this year, can you talk a little bit about sustainability as we look into next year? And what do you think some of the real guideposts we should be watching as far as drivers, NDAA, FCC, any other things that could lead to market share gains there? And then the follow-up on the command center software side, low double digits. I think, there have been some views, it could be better than that. So maybe can you talk a little bit about, what needs to be done for that business to reaccelerate from these levels? Is it winning new customers? Is it more stimulus? Is it more the bundle sales? If you could give us some color on that too. That'd be great. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Yes, Tim, on video, it's just -- it's phenomenal execution by Molloy and the entire management team. As you know, it's our largest addressable market now expected to grow over 30%, by the way, organically, it's probably a little over 20%, so still really a strong, robust growth. We've rounded out the portfolio. We've refreshed the product portfolio. I think Jack and team had done a great job investing in go-to-market and increasing our R&D in a downturn market. I think video continues to be more -- and access control continues to be more and more important with our customers and more of a need to have than a nice to have. As you referenced, the NDAA is helpful for sure around federal procurement, as well as the eligibility for federal grant money. And look with the FCC, as you know, and as you referenced, there's pending legislation has been done. It's awaiting Biden's signature. If President Biden signs it when and if he does that authorizes the FCC to proceed with the rulemaking they've undertaken which would evaluate Chinese vendors in the entire enterprise market. So that clearly would be significant as well. Don't know the timing for that. But that would be a tailwind if that were to materialize. I don't know if Jack, you want to add anything about the overall demand profile.\nJack Molloy: Just the only other thing, I think, first of all, new product introduction, both in terms of cameras, but also moving pivoting the capability for the move to the cloud. I think also you look at it from an acquisition standpoint. We've acquired Openpath, who's really quite frankly, a game changer from the access control standpoint. This week, Tim, we announced the acquisition of Envysion. So you can look at that as a way for us to get more vertically focused in terms of our solution. And as Greg talked about in the past, one of the reasons we acquired Pelco and IndigoVision was to add greater international scale. We've invested heavily in go-to-market North America. I think the next frontier will be in Europe, Middle East, and Africa.\nGreg Brown: And as it relates to command center software, candidly, Tim, in retrospect that the target was maybe a little overly ambitious, but having said that we're still growing at 1.5x the market, so we're taking share it's growing double digits. Q3 was particularly good on orders and the backlog composition is a little bit longer in duration incorporating some things around next-gen 911 and annual recurring revenue.\nJason Winkler: And just in terms of specific things that we're doing a core tenet for us is always to meet customers where they are. That's a part of our product strategy. Many of our customers have invested in some sophisticated IT infrastructure on-premises, and they would like to continue to benefit from those investments, but they also know that certain cloud capabilities are just better. Those capabilities are just better delivered through the cloud, and we want to give the customers the flexibility to choose and to move to the cloud in their own timeline. And so with relation to that, we're offering flexibility in deployment via hybrid offerings, and we're doing three specific things there. One, we're offering our on-prem solutions, inclusive of CAD and Records on a subscription basis. We're going to be integrating the capabilities, both existing and new capabilities in command central cloud with our on-prem solutions to allow our customers to choose what capabilities they would like to consume from the cloud. And third, cybersecurity is a very important consideration, regardless of whether the solution is deployed on-prem or whether it's in the cloud or integrating cybersecurity monitoring as a service into both the solutions as a whole. I think all of that combined really accelerates the adoption of cloud capabilities across all our customers.\nTim Long: Okay, great. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thank you, Tim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSami Badri: Thank you. First around this time of every single year, you should give us out year initial takes or views. Greg, I was hoping you'd give us any kind of guideposts for revenue or EPS growth or even margin. And then the second question, I have is actually on just U.S. federal on what percentage of revenue that was in the quarter? And what the expectation is for U.S. federal revenues to be for the full year. That's it. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Yes. So we're not going to obviously Sami guide 2022 per se, but I will tell you that kind of, as we sit here today we're thinking, tough supply chain environment, by the way, Q3 was a tough, I'm proud of the quarter. I'm proud of the print, but it was tough and Q4 is tough as well. So I think that Q3, Q4 from a supply chain standpoint is the toughest we've experienced. We still expect it to be difficult and challenging first half of '22 at least -- first half of '22, so that's kind of the backdrop having said that. I think about revenue growth at this point high level of about 7% and maybe further dimensionalization of software and services, revenue growth of around 10% that's high level. Our current thinking obviously details to follow in a quarter from now, it would also be our expectation and goal to expand operating margins. But in '22 in the face of higher input costs as well, that's kind of some high level color.\nJason Winkler: And Sami, to mention the second part of your question with respect to Fed, it's roughly 8% of our revenues. Well, we're having another strong year in Fed like last year. So 8% of revenues is, is its contribution to us. It's one in totality. It's one of our largest customers.\nSami Badri: Perfect. And actually I had one follow-up and maybe this is for Mahesh. It's about the M500 in-car video system enabled by AI. Do you guys have any competitors that actually do this right now, at least with an install-based like yours and even a rollout or even go-to-market product like yours?\nMahesh Saptharishi: No. WatchGuard for the past 10 years has been the leader in in-car video of body-worn and the M500 is really a product of all the insights and the excellent feedback we've gotten from those customers. And candidly, I think the M500 improves upon the core features of the four RE, which is the current in-car video solution from WatchGuard. We improve on our synchronized playback capability, which is something that is that tight integration with our body-worn camera and our in-car video solution, so that you can get a perspective of what's happening in the incident in a time synchronized manner. This is something that is very unique to what we do. Record after the fact is a very unique capability that we have within the WatchGuard portfolio. And we have a dedicated display capability in the product, which is something that we've got an excellent feedback from our customers on. It allows you to both record review and tag a video with a dedicated display. In addition to that, what M500 brings to the table is ALPR capabilities. ALPR capabilities, not just with watch lists, but also integrated with our learn platform, which has the largest database of play treats out there. That's time and location stamped, which allows for great real-time forensics and investigation capability. And to the rear camera in the M500 platform, we have added passenger analytics capabilities so that when a passenger is detected, we can actually effectively trigger recordings as an option, configurable within the system. The platform itself is AI-enabled to the point where now we can add new capabilities in the future via simple firmware upgrade. So it's actually future-proof for customers as well. So all in, this is a very unique and a powerful in-car video platform, that's a product of all the experience that we've gained over the past 10 years.\nJason Winkler: And Greg, perhaps if I could elaborate on this about 7% growth.\nGreg Brown: Yes, Sure.\nJason Winkler: As we look at next year and plan for it, the linearity we're looking at for Q1 is more consistent with 2019, about 21%. In fact, the 2019 first half, or the entirety of the linearity of that year looks to be a better indicator for what we see in terms of supply chain and the planning we're doing for the business.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKyle McNealy: Hi guys. Thanks very much for the question. I'm on here for George Notter. This was a really strong result for a product backlog coming out of the quarter. It looks like you've had a good quarter for the number of larger LMR deals and that seems to be driving. And you had a good portion from U.S. and international. So I'm wondering if you can comment on what's driving the volume of larger deals, like, is there something specific or a trend that's kind of going on in the near term? Or is this general continued macro recovery after the pandemic eases worldwide? And I'm also wondering if you could expect that momentum to continue based on your view of the pipeline. Thanks.\nJack Molloy: Yes, Kyle. So to your point it's been a very good first three quarters of the year. We actually expect that performance to continue. We're sitting on record backlog of $631 million year-over-year, and that's not only historically. We'd look at that and say, that's North America phenomenon. I think the strength of the story here, it's North America performance. So it's large scale device refresh. It's statewide infrastructure upgrades. Some of which were in further discussions through ARP funding, which will play out over the course of the next few years, but also internationally, we've been in receipt of two large orders from the German defense as well as a Romanian upgrade as well. So again, we've been really pleased the performance to date. We expect that performance to continue.\nJason Winkler: Yes, demand is definitely exceeding supply. And the other thing about our backlog, particularly in products is approximately half of it's expected to turn into revenue within 12 months. So there's a longer duration impact of some of the deals Jack mentioned where we're deploying, implementing, and they benefit the revenue stream over a longer period.\nGreg Brown: Yes. And Kyle, just the last thing I'd say is, as I said, in my prepared remarks, demand is strong and our demand visibility is good. In addition to the backlog that Jack articulated and the linearity that Jason just said, taking a step back, this is more than just pent-up demand. It's a reflection of what we do is a need to have versus a nice to have the funding environment, as I referenced both budgets and stimulus is strong. We've refreshed a lot of the portfolio on the product side. We've made a conscious investment in go-to-market channels and feet on The Street we've continued to acquire. We've got the benefit of the National Defense Authorization Act. More revenue is software and services oriented. So I think there's a lot of different positive ingredients in the blender here that continue to fuel our growth going forward.\nKyle McNealy: Okay, great. Thanks very much. And one follow-up, do you \u2013 I'm not sure if you mentioned it, but do you have an update on the run rate of the PCR business now and maybe an outlook for the continued recovery and the outlook for PCR?\nGreg Brown: Yes, I think PCR is where the supply chain challenges most acute. It grew in Q3. It will grow for the full year, Kyle probably as we match supply and demand and it's fluid, it will, we expect it to end up about mid to high-single-digit growth with a reasonable chunk of delinquent backlog for us to execute against in 2022.\nKyle McNealy: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to start on the product and system integration margin expansion. Operating profit grew at double the rate of revenue basically, and had nice margin expansion in that segment. I wouldn't consider this an industry where you'd get short-term pricing power benefit to hit margins positively, so just maybe looking for some more color on the PSI margin expansion? And then as an extension to that question, I look at that segment, before COVID, it was a low to mid-20s operating margin, clearly not going to finish there in 2021 based on your guidance, but maybe some of the gating factors to getting back to those historical operating margins in that segment would be helpful.\nJason Winkler: Sure. So thanks for the question. So one thing that's we're pleased with the operating margin expansion in products. One thing that we are benefiting from is the prioritization of our portfolio to public safety. So that's a favorable mix element around margins and ASP's. As Greg mentioned and Jack we're constrained more so in PCR, which is a bit on the lower tier. So favorable mix is definitely improving what you see in Q3, we're pleased with the OE performance on the year. I would also remind you that as we began the year and plan this year at the OE line for the company, we were facing $100 million dollar year-over-year increase in incentives, as we reset the plans to 100% coming off of last year where we only paid half. So the bulk of that $100 million for the year is in the product segment. So we're expanding, operating margins despite overcoming that additional P&L burden. In terms of its outlook, we're continuing to manage through higher input costs, higher freight, but our plans with the growth that we've talked about, we will continue even in the face of higher supply costs to expand operating margins in that segment.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. And maybe as a follow-up Greg, I'm going to take a stab since it's been in the public domain on Airwave, any potential comments you could make on developments, investors have long considered you kind of double hedged because of both Airwave and ESN, but wondering if they should be considering the potential risk of losing that hedge? And secondly, you're not afraid to get creative. I'm just wondering if there's maybe any sort of alternative ownership structures, like a JV or something like that, that you're considering. So I know it's a tough topic, but anything that you can give us would be helpful. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: I appreciate the question. So just to remind you, I think, Adam, that the contract for Airwave runs through all of next year through 2022. ESN under its current construct runs through all of 2024. We've been in active conversations with the UK home office. They have expressed the desire to extend the Airwave contract. That's underpinned the ongoing conversations we've had. We also obviously are involved with the CMA and are adhering to the process that they've outlined. I think the process will take several months. It will go into well into 2022. There's really nothing more to say on it, on that front, other than we continue to make the investments in the network as well, to keep it current, to keep it reliable, the service levels to the end user customer, and no disruption to that are the absolute utmost importance. And we'll continue the dialogue with both the UK home office and the CMA, and, I am hopeful that we'll have constructive outcomes, but we'll see how it plays out over the next several months. But I do appreciate you bringing it up.\nAdam Tindle: Understood. Very helpful. Thanks, Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nTrevor Bowers: Hi, this is Trevor filling in for Keith. Have a couple of questions about this supply chain. So how have the supply chain challenges evolved since the last quarter? Do you expect them to worsen before improving or would -- from your perspective, would you say the supply chain challenges are peaked?\nGreg Brown: It's a great question, Trevor. I think the most acute challenges we've had year-to-date were undoubtedly in Q3. I think they're continuing in Q4. So if I look at 2021, definitely the most pain on supply chain we've experienced is in Q3. And we expect to experience in Q4. I think the environment will be rugged and challenging through the first half, at least the first half of 2022. And that's informing obviously the guide for the remainder of the year, although we're raising top and bottom, and it informs the linearity that Jason referred to earlier around Q1.\nJason Winkler: And I'd also add in terms of what we're doing to manage through a difficult environment. Number one, we're prioritizing our customer needs, and that starts with public safety. Additionally, Motorola has world-class engineering across the organization. Jack's team is helping think through alternative designs where engineers very quickly find parts that are available when one part is constrained. So our teams are doing a good job there. Each one of us here on the call have supplier relationships that we have C level dialogues going on so that we can get our allocations. And finally, we're carrying higher inventory as well to manage the environment.\nTrevor Bowers: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nGreg Brown: Thanks Trevor.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nLouie DiPalma: Greg, Jason, Mahesh, Jack, and Tim, good evening. Excellent. LMR product revenue increased by a healthy 12% this quarter after an 18% increase last quarter, despite the referenced supply chain issues, can you give us a sense on what you think your penetration is for your APX NEXT radio, your MXP600 Tetra. And you were recently announced MOTOTRBO. I think you launched the APX next in the fall of 2019. So a lot of investors are just wondering, like, what inning are we in for the respective upgrade cycles for these different product refreshes that you have had over the past couple of years?\nGreg Brown: So Louie, first let's attack the APX NEXT piece. It's very early days. We're really, really pleased. So we announced it in '19, obviously last year during the COVID year, I would say, we had -- the market was somewhat stalled in the first and second quarter. We've seen a significant ramp up in terms of orders since then. But all day long we've talked about, you've heard me make mentioned before. This is typically a three to five-year cycle where we start getting some material, a refresh within our customers base U.S. about an inning. I'd say we're in the top of the second inning potentially. We have room to run here in terms of APX NEXT. The second question was related to the MXP600 in Europe and it's again, very early days. We've had some market success. But the interesting thing to point out for both the APX NEXT, as well as the MXP is those were designed for very high tier part of the market. So that's attractive, but the reality is we're going to be feathering in mid-tier and entry tier on both the APX NEXT line, as well as the MXP line. So we're really encouraged by that because that starts to get to the need of the market, so to speak. So I think that answers your question.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And you spoke about the supply chain headwind persisting through the first half of 2022. Do you think these issues results in a deceleration in the recent revenue rate or should we forecast for like sustained revenue growth for the next three quarters?\nJason Winkler: No, Louie, I think our comments or my comments around the linearity that we're planning for reflect our views of the supply chain, particularly for Q1 in the first half of next year, limiting our ability to fulfill the very good demand that's there and yes, for things to improve in the second half and to have a good year that Greg mentioned of planning for about 7% in total revenue growth.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. Thanks.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Louie.\nOperator: Next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks guys. I appreciate you taking the questions. First off, if I miss it, I apologize. But what was the supply chain impact in Q3 and what do you expect it to be in Q4 in terms of quantifying it, both the revenue impact and the margin impact?\nGreg Brown: So in terms of Q3 our results and the growth that we had except for PCR which was limited in its ability we were able to match the supply with the demand pretty well in Q3, as we look to Q4 and the constraints that we have in embedded in our guidance for the year and therefore Q4 about $100 million of revenue is limited. That could have been there we had the requisite supply, that's our current estimate. In terms of an impact to Q4 that said, we're still growing greater than we thought and guided to last time now, 10 to 10.25. But that $100 million is our current estimate as to have we had a better supply, what more we could have done in Q4?\nPaul Silverstein: Jason, am I doing the math, right? That's about if I translate that to an EPS, it's about an -- it's about $0.10 impact.\nJason Winkler: Depends on the mix, obviously.\nGreg Brown: It depends on the mix and a large part of that's PCR. So it's probably a little left of center. But in general, you can do the math as you've done around, what does contribution could be at? I'd add further color around the supply chain costs that we are seeing in order to get the requisite supply. There are increasing costs. I mentioned freight before many companies like us are facing higher freight costs, the number that we're embedding in the P&L this year for higher premiums is nearly $45 million on the year was a lot of that in the second half. And then as I looked at Q4 and the plans we put together for Q4 having to buy and get these materials, not only through expedited freight, but also through other means through brokers and distribution and the like is adding about $20 million of pressure to what we had planned for Q4. So those things are in the mix too. We're doing what's necessary to get the supply that we can get.\nPaul Silverstein: Jason, I apologize. You're expecting $20 million pressure in Q4 from freight costs or from elevated component costs?\nJason Winkler: The components' is the $20 million number in Q4. Freight is an annual number. Paul that we've been bearing all along and on its annual basis, it's $45 million, about $20 million in the first half and $25 million in the second half, that's the freight higher costs. The ocean and air both are exorbitant prices right now. And we're having to mix two more faster delivery methods, which is causing a higher freight cost as well.\nPaul Silverstein: All right. But it sounds like it's a 1% to 1.5%, if I assume a $10 million to $15 million impact in Q4 from freight, it's about $30 million, $35 million all in, it looks like it's about 1.5 percentage point adverse impact, if I did the math, right?\nGreg Brown: Those are the numbers that we've shared are our estimates within what we were facing. So I think you've got correctly captured, yes.\nJason Winkler: Yes. I think you're in the zip code.\nPaul Silverstein: All right. I appreciate it. It sounds pretty meaningful between revenue margins, not surprisingly? My other questions is also clarifications, you always said that if I remember correctly, I think you said public sector video in Q2 had hit a $330 plus million run rate, annual run rate of from $300 million previously. I'm hoping you could update us. And I think similarly you'd said mobile cameras, body-worn cameras in 2Q was up 80% year-over-year, that was an acceleration over 60% previously. I was hoping you could update that growth, right?\nGreg Brown: Yeah. I think, and Jack can jump in. I think the $330 million you referenced was an estimate for 2021 for public sector contribution. And I think we're holding to that number. So I don't think we have an update on that front and on body-worn, Jack if you want to.\nJack Molloy: Paul, with body-worn so record unit shipments in Q3, really pleased with that. We've talked about as active customers, our customers want that alternative. We think we filled that really well. The other thing I'd say is, we're uniquely positioned internationally, given our scale and global presence. We talked about the French NOI they've actually put subsequent orders into Q3. Mahesh just referenced M500. So we think we're in a good position right now in body-worn car.\nPaul Silverstein: All right. Just one -- last quick one for me. In terms of pricing environment in supply constraints, I'd be surprised, if it got worse and it won't be a surprise, it got better, but any insight you can set and what you're seeing competitively?\nJason Winkler: Yes. We've been looking carefully at our portfolio throughout the year. We've made a few surgical adjustments in LMR primarily in North America and also in fixed video. We'll continue to look at that. Another opportunity for us is we have constant new product releases and oftentimes as Jack mentioned, APX NEXT, for example. We typically release at the higher part of the portfolio. And with that presents a mix opportunity to offset some of the costs that we discussed earlier. So we'll continue to look at it carefully, and of course, monitoring, what is a very competitive in market that we're in both LMR and fixed video.\nPaul Silverstein: Great. I appreciate the responses. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nBen Bollin: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question, Greg or Jack, I was hoping you could take us through a little bit about what you're seeing with America rescue plan funding to date, how you think it might've manifested thus far. And then the second part of the question is, I'd be interested in any thoughts you have about how customers are looking at this money within each piece of your business. So within surveillance radio and even command center, how you think it's influencing their behavior. That's it for me. Thank you.\nJack Molloy: Okay. So first of all, Greg said it earlier and I think it's always important to point out, but we're in a unique position because really what we do is all need to have, it's not nice to have. So I'd kind of decompose the American rescue plan conversation to a few different things. We have public safety and that's everything from P25 statewide and local networks to command center software. We're in pretty consistent dialogue with our customers regularly in public safety who had what we call shovel ready projects or things that maybe would have been a mid-tier kind of midterm need. And we're in conversations on how they may fund those things. Now, the other benefit is state and local receipts actually particular at the state level revenues are up as well. So Greg made a comment earlier about funding environment, the funding environment, I would say, doing business in public safety in 28 years, it's the best I've ever seen as well. So I would say, we're in a really good position there both on the P25 landscape, infrastructure upgrades and devices, as well as command center software. Our teams, the one thing our sales team does, we think they're really good at technology. We think they're better and they're experts at getting deals funded. So we think that's going to benefit us there. The second thing, I would say the other technology sleeve, that's going to benefit significantly as video security and access control. If you think about education alone, school funding, $170 billion pointed to that market, and really when kids have come back to school, the first thing they're talking about is they're talking about, how do we bring them back in a safe manner? One of the things our team did over the COVID we talked about this was to write COVID dashboard. So if you connect to a Avigilon cloud services, you get our COVID dashboard gives social distancing who went through what door. This is all really pertinent information. And we think our school superintendent, security directors are really interested in our technology here. The last thing, I would say is, there's money being pointed at airports and transit $35 billion as they reopen, many of them are upgrading both the radio networks. So we've got opportunities for PCR with all the major airlines, as well as our consoles in the command center space. And then ultimately also video security, how do they protect the perimeter security? How do they get better information? So I would say across all three of our technology continuums, as well as our services business, the money, the environment we're in a good spot. We think our sales team is poised to execute.\nGreg Brown: And Ben when you total up those buckets within the rescue plan that Jack just described, it's over a $0.5 trillion that is available to our end users, $350 billion in state and local, by the way, that's multi-year and goes through the end of '24. So hence why we both see and believe that the environment multi-year and what we're seeing in the pipeline is pretty good.\nBen Bollin: Thanks guys.\nGreg Brown: Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Fahad Najam with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.\nFahad Najam: Thank you for taking my question. First, a clarification, can you remind me what revenue was from acquisitions in the quarter?\nJason Winkler: Yes. In total, I'll give it to you by a segment real quick. It was -- in products, it was $12 million and in services and software, it was only $3 million.\nFahad Najam: Appreciate it. Thank you. Now to my question, if I look at your LMR business overall, well, PSI sales, if we accelerated the software and services and tax rate coming and remains in the $550 million, $545 million quarterly run rate, should we see kind of like an increase in the software services from the increased product from the increased PSI sales in future quarters? Is it just because you're selling new equipment and the software services hasn't quite attached to it yet? So we should expect some meaningful acceleration in software and services revenue for LMR in fiscal '22?\nJason Winkler: So Fahad, this year for products, for example, we're expecting mid to high, probably closer to high-single-digit growth services and software is low double digits. There is some leading indicator as products grow you're right. There's some services attached to it that come after the sale, the bulk, however, of our services and software growth is around not product attacks, task, but rather command center software, video software and things like software upgrade programs and the likes that are on existing install bases. So those are the key drivers within S&S. It's less product attached. It's more the unique offerings we have in the value propositions around services and software that are driving the low double digit growth in services and software.\nFahad Najam: Got it. And then same question on the video surveillance there the software services portion of the video surveillance market is clearly growing a lot faster? I'm just trying to understand the dynamics there. What's driving the software attach rates or services in video versus PSI sales? I just kind of try to help us understand the dynamics there, please.\nJason Winkler: So with respect to video in the disaggregation within services and software, the video number within services and software is largely software. It's a minimally services business because we go through distribution partners, integrators and the likes. So think of that video software number within S&S as being predominantly software, things like our video management system, BMS ACC and others are offers within in-car video. Our -- what's -- more in that case, it's real pure software and a terrific business, somewhat product detached, but also standalone in terms of how we sell it.\nGreg Brown: It's the analytics, it's the AI at the edge. It's all the things we do. I made mention earlier that we've invested into our Avigilon cloud services. We've now got meaningful connections on that, and that'll be another way for customers to get upgrades. And I think make they keeping current on software, software maintenance more dynamic as well.\nJason Winkler: Yes. And particularly that connections to the clouds and the work that Jack's doing with his team are leading to many new business opportunities hundreds of thousands of cameras, thousands of sites. And the business is really moving in that direction to cloud enabled.\nJack Molloy: And the last thing Fahad, I'd say on that is, you hear Greg talk a lot about acquisitions. I'll hit again on Envysion. That's approximately $25 million in recurring revenue. There you think about Openpath which is an access control recurring revenue model access control. And so there were re-envisioning that business as well. So I just -- those are other things that really are more software driven, recurring revenue model business, and that's really where we're pushing the business.\nFahad Najam: Appreciate the answers. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Lapinski: Hi team. This is Erik on for Meta. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on another great quarter. You understand this is a small dealer relative to everything else, but maybe if we could dive in a little bit on the command center deal, you saw with the City of Yonkers, I'm wondering like what drove their upgrade to command central was that timing of refresh with what they already had. Were they looking to integrate their body-camera deployment? And then you also noted to fix the video portion of that. Are they integrating fixed a video into the command central deployment? And are there other similar deals in the pipeline that you're looking at that you can work with customers maybe as they take advantage of some of their funding?\nGreg Brown: I'll take a first stab at this, but at the customer level, Yonkers is a very progressive technologically savvy police, chief and command staff. This started I want to say this probably started nine. The discussion started probably sometime mid last year originally around a mobile video. And they've added obviously to that in the command center space. And I think what they're thinking about is they're leveraging how is information sharing so everything from digital evidence management to how that's shared seamlessly through the rest of the command center. I don't know if Mahesh has anything else you'd add onto that but?\nMahesh Saptharishi: Yes, I think you can think about this -- across the incident life cycle. We have products today that touch on every aspect of that incident lifecycle, a fixed video from Avigilon really gives you that pre-incident view, but also gives you that view during the incident integrated into or being management solution, but also coming into our command central aware platform as well. Then you have CommandCentral suite products across the board. Then you have vigilant ALPR solution. That was part of that equation as well, to enable fast investigations. Leveraging both the fixed camera solution, but also ALPR cameras as well, body-worn cameras feeding into that same evidence platform adding to the mix and then mass notification was also part of the story there. So all that together, it really gives you a view of an integration between those products really enabling effective incident response. And I think that was the value to Yonkers.\nErik Lapinski: Thank you. And I mean, when you just see the market and those types of deals, do you expect more of a consolidation that way? It seems that it would make sense, but also understand not everyone is tech. Is that tech savvy as maybe their police chief? What can you do from a sales motion perspective to kind of bring in more deals like that?\nGreg Brown: So, two things Mahesh used this -- made a comment, and this is something that Mahesh and I talk about all the time. It's meet customers, where they are. So some customers have a different -- they're on different investment journey. Some may want to buy from different vendors, what we're incenting our sales team to do. And this is really important. And this actually started in 2020 is incenting them, and they have a chance to make some pretty significant incentives to sell full suite integrated networks, where they're using all pieces of our command center software technology. That's the goal. We think they've got the right relationships and what they'll need to do is go continue to execute on that and find more and more Yonkers.\nMahesh Saptharishi: I'll just add to that. Just after that so 75% of our orders in Q3 were either new customers' ordering more than one of our platforms or adding to existing Motorola Solutions, really leveraging that tight integration between them all.\nErik Lapinski: It's a great start. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Mine will be pretty easy. The first one is Greg, you said something in my ears, didn't quite catch it. So maybe you can clarify, you said really preliminary, preliminary, really early looks for next year. I heard a 7% then I think I heard a 10%, but I wasn't sure if you're breaking down product services or company-wide, if you could just clarify that, then I have one other little clarification.\nGreg Brown: Sure. Jim. Yes, no. I was talking about 7% revenue growth in 2022 full company view and then software and services being around 10% revenue growth within that envelope. That's kind of what we see at this point in time. And then the details and more color we'd give a quarter from now.\nJim Suva: So that was easy. My second easy part is, and then I'll be done. Your outlook, you raised your revenues for the full year and for Q4, but then the EPS you raised it, but not as much as the EPS beat, is that all attributed to additional shipping costs? Or is there something else in Q4 as to why earnings wouldn't be as much as the beat that just we had in Q3? Thank you.\nJason Winkler: Jim, it's Jason. It's some of what I discussed earlier with Paul around supply chain costs, but additionally, it is higher OpEx in Q4 for funding the two acquisitions that we just brought into the fold of Openpath exactly and Envysion, which is driving our envelope to 1950 for the year. Those are -- we're very happy to fund those within the OpEx line, great companies. That's also a factoring into the math that you're doing.\nJim Suva: Thank you. And thanks so much for the details on the calls.\nGreg Brown: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional or closing remarks.\nGreg Brown: Thank you. Listen, I just want to say thank you to the whole management team, but also to all the employees in MSI. I mean, there's so many good things going on, but it's a tough environment. I want to thank the people on the frontline, the sales organization, that's really executing well and contributing to Q3 record backlogs supply. You hear it with every company. You hear it all the time, but the supply chain environment, as we said, challenging in Q3, remains challenging in Q4. And I just think the team here in mixing and matching and there's more fluidity and uncertainty in supply chain in Q3 and Q4 than we've had in prior periods. And I think the adaptability staying in touch and close touch with key suppliers. I appreciate all that. Everybody on the support teams and back office and support functions in particularly HR and Karen Dunning and Terry Bell, because we have, it's a tough environment. We have vaccine mandate compliance requirements. We're always following rules and regulations by facility and by state and Karen and Terry, Mark Hacker phenomenal. I'm thrilled with Q3 and the results across the board. I'm proud that we're able to for three consecutive quarters' raise top and bottom line. And I think we're really well positioned going into 2022, despite the challenges we have, but we'll stick together, like we always do. We'll be flexible and will continue to be steadfast and focused. And I appreciate everybody's contribution onward and upward. And thank you everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

            "name": "Jason Winkler",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Our Q3 results included revenue of $2.1 billion up 13%, including $15 million from acquisitions and $25 million from favorable currency rates. GAAP operating earnings of $451 million and operating margins of 21.4% compared to 18.9% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $555 million, up $92 million or 20% from the year ago quarter. And non-GAAP operating margin was 26.3% of sales up from 24.8% driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage in both of our segments. GAAP earnings per share of $1.76 compared to $1.18 in the year ago quarter, the increase was primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage as well as a loss related to the refinancing of long-term debt that occurred in the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.35 compared to $1.95 last year, primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margin and improved operating leverage again in both segments. OpEx in Q3 was $496 million, up $41 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation related to incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions. Turning to cash flow, Q3 operating cash flow was $376 million compared with $392 million in the prior year while free cash flow was $315 million compared with $343 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to an increase in working capital inclusive of our higher inventory, partially offset by higher earnings. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $1.1 billion up $225 million compared with last year and free cash flow was $959 million, up $201 million over last year. The increase in cash flow year-to-date was primarily driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid during this year. Our capital allocation in Q3 included $137 million in share repurchases at an average price of $234.18, $120 million in cash dividends and $61 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million. We invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolv, whose technology powers are concealed weapons detection solution, and subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Envysion, a leader in enterprise video security and business analytics for $124 million net of cash. Moving next to our segment results, Q3 products and system integration sales were $1.3 billion up 14% driven by strong growth in LMR and video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $12 million. Operating earnings were $273 million or 20.6% of sales up from 18.9% in the year prior on higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in this segment include $72 million of P25 orders from a large U.S. federal customer, a $70 million TETRA order from the German Navy, a $45 million TETRA upgrade from a large EMEA customer, a $43 million P25 order from a large North America customer, a $22 million P25 upgrade from Metro Sa\u0303o Paulo in Brazil. And also during the quarter, we grew our video security and access control product revenue by 23%. Moving to the software and services segment, Q3 revenue was $782 million, up 11% from last year driven by growth in LMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $3 million. Operating earnings were $282 million or 36% of sales, up 140 basis points from last year driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved OpEx leverage. Within this segment, some notable Q3 wins included a $41 million command center software contract with a large U.S. state and local customer, $31 million P25 multi-year extension with a customer in North America, a $17 million Push-to-Talk over broadband multi-year renewal with a large U.S. customer, a $7 million CommandCentral suite and video security order with the City of Yonkers, New York, which expanded off of a prior body-worn camera win. During the quarter, we grew our video security and access control software revenue by 32%. Additionally, we launched the M500, the first in-car video system enabled by artificial intelligence. Moving next to our regional results. Q3 North America revenue was $1.4 billion, up 14% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software. International Q3 revenue was $658 million, up 10% also driven by LMR, video security and command center software. We saw strong growth in EMEA and Latin America during the quarter, while in Asia Pac, we continue to experience headwinds related to COVID-19 lockdowns in various countries. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q3 record of $11.4 billion, up $710 million compared to last year driven primarily by growth in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $144 million also driven primarily by growth in North America. Software and services backlog was up $6 million compared to last year driven by a $479 million increase in multi-year services and software contracts, partially offset by revenue recognition on AirWave and ESN over the last year. Sequentially, backlog was down $112 million driven primarily by revenue recognition for AirWave and ESN during the quarter, partially offset by growth in services and software contracts in North America. The products in SI backlog would up $704 million compared to last year and $256 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions. Turning next to our outlook. We now expect full year sales to be up 10% to 10.25% compared to our prior guide of 9.5% to 10%. And we now expect full year earnings per share between $9 and $9.04 per share, up from our prior guide of $8.88 to $8.98 per share. This increased outlook includes the video security and access control technology growing greater than 30%. It also includes our current view of supply chain conditions, FX at current spot rates and an effective tax rate of 21.5% along with a diluted share count of 174 million shares. And finally, we now expect full year OpEx to be $1.95 billion inclusive of our two latest acquisitions Openpath and Envysion. And we expect full year operating cash flow to be approximately $1.825 billion, up $25 million from our prior estimate. With that I'd like to now turn the call back over to Greg. And just in terms of specific things that we're doing a core tenet for us is always to meet customers where they are. That's a part of our product strategy. Many of our customers have invested in some sophisticated IT infrastructure on-premises, and they would like to continue to benefit from those investments, but they also know that certain cloud capabilities are just better. Those capabilities are just better delivered through the cloud, and we want to give the customers the flexibility to choose and to move to the cloud in their own timeline. And so with relation to that, we're offering flexibility in deployment via hybrid offerings, and we're doing three specific things there. One, we're offering our on-prem solutions, inclusive of CAD and Records on a subscription basis. We're going to be integrating the capabilities, both existing and new capabilities in command central cloud with our on-prem solutions to allow our customers to choose what capabilities they would like to consume from the cloud. And third, cybersecurity is a very important consideration, regardless of whether the solution is deployed on-prem or whether it's in the cloud or integrating cybersecurity monitoring as a service into both the solutions as a whole. I think all of that combined really accelerates the adoption of cloud capabilities across all our customers. And Sami, to mention the second part of your question with respect to Fed, it's roughly 8% of our revenues. Well, we're having another strong year in Fed like last year. So 8% of revenues is, is its contribution to us. It's one in totality. It's one of our largest customers. And Greg, perhaps if I could elaborate on this about 7% growth. As we look at next year and plan for it, the linearity we're looking at for Q1 is more consistent with 2019, about 21%. In fact, the 2019 first half, or the entirety of the linearity of that year looks to be a better indicator for what we see in terms of supply chain and the planning we're doing for the business. Yes, demand is definitely exceeding supply. And the other thing about our backlog, particularly in products is approximately half of it's expected to turn into revenue within 12 months. So there's a longer duration impact of some of the deals Jack mentioned where we're deploying, implementing, and they benefit the revenue stream over a longer period. Sure. So thanks for the question. So one thing that's we're pleased with the operating margin expansion in products. One thing that we are benefiting from is the prioritization of our portfolio to public safety. So that's a favorable mix element around margins and ASP's. As Greg mentioned and Jack we're constrained more so in PCR, which is a bit on the lower tier. So favorable mix is definitely improving what you see in Q3, we're pleased with the OE performance on the year. I would also remind you that as we began the year and plan this year at the OE line for the company, we were facing $100 million dollar year-over-year increase in incentives, as we reset the plans to 100% coming off of last year where we only paid half. So the bulk of that $100 million for the year is in the product segment. So we're expanding, operating margins despite overcoming that additional P&L burden. In terms of its outlook, we're continuing to manage through higher input costs, higher freight, but our plans with the growth that we've talked about, we will continue even in the face of higher supply costs to expand operating margins in that segment. And I'd also add in terms of what we're doing to manage through a difficult environment. Number one, we're prioritizing our customer needs, and that starts with public safety. Additionally, Motorola has world-class engineering across the organization. Jack's team is helping think through alternative designs where engineers very quickly find parts that are available when one part is constrained. So our teams are doing a good job there. Each one of us here on the call have supplier relationships that we have C level dialogues going on so that we can get our allocations. And finally, we're carrying higher inventory as well to manage the environment. No, Louie, I think our comments or my comments around the linearity that we're planning for reflect our views of the supply chain, particularly for Q1 in the first half of next year, limiting our ability to fulfill the very good demand that's there and yes, for things to improve in the second half and to have a good year that Greg mentioned of planning for about 7% in total revenue growth. Depends on the mix, obviously. The components' is the $20 million number in Q4. Freight is an annual number. Paul that we've been bearing all along and on its annual basis, it's $45 million, about $20 million in the first half and $25 million in the second half, that's the freight higher costs. The ocean and air both are exorbitant prices right now. And we're having to mix two more faster delivery methods, which is causing a higher freight cost as well. Yes. I think you're in the zip code. Yes. We've been looking carefully at our portfolio throughout the year. We've made a few surgical adjustments in LMR primarily in North America and also in fixed video. We'll continue to look at that. Another opportunity for us is we have constant new product releases and oftentimes as Jack mentioned, APX NEXT, for example. We typically release at the higher part of the portfolio. And with that presents a mix opportunity to offset some of the costs that we discussed earlier. So we'll continue to look at it carefully, and of course, monitoring, what is a very competitive in market that we're in both LMR and fixed video. Yes. In total, I'll give it to you by a segment real quick. It was -- in products, it was $12 million and in services and software, it was only $3 million. So Fahad, this year for products, for example, we're expecting mid to high, probably closer to high-single-digit growth services and software is low double digits. There is some leading indicator as products grow you're right. There's some services attached to it that come after the sale, the bulk, however, of our services and software growth is around not product attacks, task, but rather command center software, video software and things like software upgrade programs and the likes that are on existing install bases. So those are the key drivers within S&S. It's less product attached. It's more the unique offerings we have in the value propositions around services and software that are driving the low double digit growth in services and software. So with respect to video in the disaggregation within services and software, the video number within services and software is largely software. It's a minimally services business because we go through distribution partners, integrators and the likes. So think of that video software number within S&S as being predominantly software, things like our video management system, BMS ACC and others are offers within in-car video. Our -- what's -- more in that case, it's real pure software and a terrific business, somewhat product detached, but also standalone in terms of how we sell it. Yes. And particularly that connections to the clouds and the work that Jack's doing with his team are leading to many new business opportunities hundreds of thousands of cameras, thousands of sites. And the business is really moving in that direction to cloud enabled. Jim, it's Jason. It's some of what I discussed earlier with Paul around supply chain costs, but additionally, it is higher OpEx in Q4 for funding the two acquisitions that we just brought into the fold of Openpath exactly and Envysion, which is driving our envelope to 1950 for the year. Those are -- we're very happy to fund those within the OpEx line, great companies. That's also a factoring into the math that you're doing."

            "content": "No. WatchGuard for the past 10 years has been the leader in in-car video of body-worn and the M500 is really a product of all the insights and the excellent feedback we've gotten from those customers. And candidly, I think the M500 improves upon the core features of the four RE, which is the current in-car video solution from WatchGuard. We improve on our synchronized playback capability, which is something that is that tight integration with our body-worn camera and our in-car video solution, so that you can get a perspective of what's happening in the incident in a time synchronized manner. This is something that is very unique to what we do. Record after the fact is a very unique capability that we have within the WatchGuard portfolio. And we have a dedicated display capability in the product, which is something that we've got an excellent feedback from our customers on. It allows you to both record review and tag a video with a dedicated display. In addition to that, what M500 brings to the table is ALPR capabilities. ALPR capabilities, not just with watch lists, but also integrated with our learn platform, which has the largest database of play treats out there. That's time and location stamped, which allows for great real-time forensics and investigation capability. And to the rear camera in the M500 platform, we have added passenger analytics capabilities so that when a passenger is detected, we can actually effectively trigger recordings as an option, configurable within the system. The platform itself is AI-enabled to the point where now we can add new capabilities in the future via simple firmware upgrade. So it's actually future-proof for customers as well. So all in, this is a very unique and a powerful in-car video platform, that's a product of all the experience that we've gained over the past 10 years. Yes, I think you can think about this -- across the incident life cycle. We have products today that touch on every aspect of that incident lifecycle, a fixed video from Avigilon really gives you that pre-incident view, but also gives you that view during the incident integrated into or being management solution, but also coming into our command central aware platform as well. Then you have CommandCentral suite products across the board. Then you have vigilant ALPR solution. That was part of that equation as well, to enable fast investigations. Leveraging both the fixed camera solution, but also ALPR cameras as well, body-worn cameras feeding into that same evidence platform adding to the mix and then mass notification was also part of the story there. So all that together, it really gives you a view of an integration between those products really enabling effective incident response. And I think that was the value to Yonkers. I'll just add to that. Just after that so 75% of our orders in Q3 were either new customers' ordering more than one of our platforms or adding to existing Motorola Solutions, really leveraging that tight integration between them all."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks everybody for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook. First, Q3 results highlight the continued strong demand we're seeing across the business. We grew revenue 13%, earnings per share 21% and expanded operating margins by 150 basis points. Additionally, we ended the quarter with a record Q3 backlog of $11.4 billion, up 7% from last year. Second, we saw strong growth in all three technologies during the quarter. In LMR, revenue was up 11% while navigating a very challenging supply chain environment. In video security and access control revenue was up 26% driven by strong broad-based demand for both our fixed and mobile video offerings. And in command center software revenue was up 13% as we continue to expand within our existing install base and win new customers. And finally, based on our strong Q3 results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're again raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS. I'm now going to turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thanks, Jason. I thought I would end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call and before we open it up for questions. But first, our results for the quarter were outstanding and I'm extremely proud of how the team is executing through a very tough supply chain environment. We achieved record Q3 sales, operating earnings and EPS, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points and finished the quarter with a record Q3 ending backlog. Second, I want to share some color on what we're actually seeing in the two segments. In products in SI demand for both our LMR and video security solutions remained robust, highlighted by the strong revenue growth in Q3 and record ending backlog. Supply chain constraints continue to impact our LMR business, and in particularly our PCR business, as demand outpaced our ability to obtain supply in Q3 and we expect we'll continue to do so in Q4. In software and services, we continue to see strong demand, which is driving revenue growth and improve profitability. In fact, as we finish the year, we now expect operating margin to increase by 200 basis points year-over-year for the segment. Our customers continue to increase their investment in our value-added services and in software, while we now expect command center software revenue growth to be low double digits. Our video security and access control software revenue growth will likely be greater than 35% this year and is the fastest growing area within our software portfolio. Finally, as I look ahead, I'm encouraged by how we're positioned. Our strong Q3 backlog in both segments provides us with significant demand visibility. We're expanding our relationships within our existing install base to provide more software and services. The customer funding is as good as I've seen it, and our NDAA compliant manufacturing in North America is providing a key differentiator for our fixed video solutions, and while we expect the challenging supply chain environment to be with us through at least the first half of next year, we're still planning for another year of strong revenue earnings and cash flow growth in 2022. And I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Yes, Tim, on video, it's just -- it's phenomenal execution by Molloy and the entire management team. As you know, it's our largest addressable market now expected to grow over 30%, by the way, organically, it's probably a little over 20%, so still really a strong, robust growth. We've rounded out the portfolio. We've refreshed the product portfolio. I think Jack and team had done a great job investing in go-to-market and increasing our R&D in a downturn market. I think video continues to be more -- and access control continues to be more and more important with our customers and more of a need to have than a nice to have. As you referenced, the NDAA is helpful for sure around federal procurement, as well as the eligibility for federal grant money. And look with the FCC, as you know, and as you referenced, there's pending legislation has been done. It's awaiting Biden's signature. If President Biden signs it when and if he does that authorizes the FCC to proceed with the rulemaking they've undertaken which would evaluate Chinese vendors in the entire enterprise market. So that clearly would be significant as well. Don't know the timing for that. But that would be a tailwind if that were to materialize. I don't know if Jack, you want to add anything about the overall demand profile. And as it relates to command center software, candidly, Tim, in retrospect that the target was maybe a little overly ambitious, but having said that we're still growing at 1.5x the market, so we're taking share it's growing double digits. Q3 was particularly good on orders and the backlog composition is a little bit longer in duration incorporating some things around next-gen 911 and annual recurring revenue. Thank you, Tim. Yes. So we're not going to obviously Sami guide 2022 per se, but I will tell you that kind of, as we sit here today we're thinking, tough supply chain environment, by the way, Q3 was a tough, I'm proud of the quarter. I'm proud of the print, but it was tough and Q4 is tough as well. So I think that Q3, Q4 from a supply chain standpoint is the toughest we've experienced. We still expect it to be difficult and challenging first half of '22 at least -- first half of '22, so that's kind of the backdrop having said that. I think about revenue growth at this point high level of about 7% and maybe further dimensionalization of software and services, revenue growth of around 10% that's high level. Our current thinking obviously details to follow in a quarter from now, it would also be our expectation and goal to expand operating margins. But in '22 in the face of higher input costs as well, that's kind of some high level color. Yes, Sure. Yes. And Kyle, just the last thing I'd say is, as I said, in my prepared remarks, demand is strong and our demand visibility is good. In addition to the backlog that Jack articulated and the linearity that Jason just said, taking a step back, this is more than just pent-up demand. It's a reflection of what we do is a need to have versus a nice to have the funding environment, as I referenced both budgets and stimulus is strong. We've refreshed a lot of the portfolio on the product side. We've made a conscious investment in go-to-market channels and feet on The Street we've continued to acquire. We've got the benefit of the National Defense Authorization Act. More revenue is software and services oriented. So I think there's a lot of different positive ingredients in the blender here that continue to fuel our growth going forward. Yes, I think PCR is where the supply chain challenges most acute. It grew in Q3. It will grow for the full year, Kyle probably as we match supply and demand and it's fluid, it will, we expect it to end up about mid to high-single-digit growth with a reasonable chunk of delinquent backlog for us to execute against in 2022. I appreciate the question. So just to remind you, I think, Adam, that the contract for Airwave runs through all of next year through 2022. ESN under its current construct runs through all of 2024. We've been in active conversations with the UK home office. They have expressed the desire to extend the Airwave contract. That's underpinned the ongoing conversations we've had. We also obviously are involved with the CMA and are adhering to the process that they've outlined. I think the process will take several months. It will go into well into 2022. There's really nothing more to say on it, on that front, other than we continue to make the investments in the network as well, to keep it current, to keep it reliable, the service levels to the end user customer, and no disruption to that are the absolute utmost importance. And we'll continue the dialogue with both the UK home office and the CMA, and, I am hopeful that we'll have constructive outcomes, but we'll see how it plays out over the next several months. But I do appreciate you bringing it up. Thanks, Adam. It's a great question, Trevor. I think the most acute challenges we've had year-to-date were undoubtedly in Q3. I think they're continuing in Q4. So if I look at 2021, definitely the most pain on supply chain we've experienced is in Q3. And we expect to experience in Q4. I think the environment will be rugged and challenging through the first half, at least the first half of 2022. And that's informing obviously the guide for the remainder of the year, although we're raising top and bottom, and it informs the linearity that Jason referred to earlier around Q1. Thanks Trevor. So Louie, first let's attack the APX NEXT piece. It's very early days. We're really, really pleased. So we announced it in '19, obviously last year during the COVID year, I would say, we had -- the market was somewhat stalled in the first and second quarter. We've seen a significant ramp up in terms of orders since then. But all day long we've talked about, you've heard me make mentioned before. This is typically a three to five-year cycle where we start getting some material, a refresh within our customers base U.S. about an inning. I'd say we're in the top of the second inning potentially. We have room to run here in terms of APX NEXT. The second question was related to the MXP600 in Europe and it's again, very early days. We've had some market success. But the interesting thing to point out for both the APX NEXT, as well as the MXP is those were designed for very high tier part of the market. So that's attractive, but the reality is we're going to be feathering in mid-tier and entry tier on both the APX NEXT line, as well as the MXP line. So we're really encouraged by that because that starts to get to the need of the market, so to speak. So I think that answers your question. Thanks, Louie. So in terms of Q3 our results and the growth that we had except for PCR which was limited in its ability we were able to match the supply with the demand pretty well in Q3, as we look to Q4 and the constraints that we have in embedded in our guidance for the year and therefore Q4 about $100 million of revenue is limited. That could have been there we had the requisite supply, that's our current estimate. In terms of an impact to Q4 that said, we're still growing greater than we thought and guided to last time now, 10 to 10.25. But that $100 million is our current estimate as to have we had a better supply, what more we could have done in Q4? It depends on the mix and a large part of that's PCR. So it's probably a little left of center. But in general, you can do the math as you've done around, what does contribution could be at? I'd add further color around the supply chain costs that we are seeing in order to get the requisite supply. There are increasing costs. I mentioned freight before many companies like us are facing higher freight costs, the number that we're embedding in the P&L this year for higher premiums is nearly $45 million on the year was a lot of that in the second half. And then as I looked at Q4 and the plans we put together for Q4 having to buy and get these materials, not only through expedited freight, but also through other means through brokers and distribution and the like is adding about $20 million of pressure to what we had planned for Q4. So those things are in the mix too. We're doing what's necessary to get the supply that we can get. Those are the numbers that we've shared are our estimates within what we were facing. So I think you've got correctly captured, yes. Yeah. I think, and Jack can jump in. I think the $330 million you referenced was an estimate for 2021 for public sector contribution. And I think we're holding to that number. So I don't think we have an update on that front and on body-worn, Jack if you want to. Thank you, Paul. And Ben when you total up those buckets within the rescue plan that Jack just described, it's over a $0.5 trillion that is available to our end users, $350 billion in state and local, by the way, that's multi-year and goes through the end of '24. So hence why we both see and believe that the environment multi-year and what we're seeing in the pipeline is pretty good. Thank you, Ben. It's the analytics, it's the AI at the edge. It's all the things we do. I made mention earlier that we've invested into our Avigilon cloud services. We've now got meaningful connections on that, and that'll be another way for customers to get upgrades. And I think make they keeping current on software, software maintenance more dynamic as well. I'll take a first stab at this, but at the customer level, Yonkers is a very progressive technologically savvy police, chief and command staff. This started I want to say this probably started nine. The discussion started probably sometime mid last year originally around a mobile video. And they've added obviously to that in the command center space. And I think what they're thinking about is they're leveraging how is information sharing so everything from digital evidence management to how that's shared seamlessly through the rest of the command center. I don't know if Mahesh has anything else you'd add onto that but? So, two things Mahesh used this -- made a comment, and this is something that Mahesh and I talk about all the time. It's meet customers, where they are. So some customers have a different -- they're on different investment journey. Some may want to buy from different vendors, what we're incenting our sales team to do. And this is really important. And this actually started in 2020 is incenting them, and they have a chance to make some pretty significant incentives to sell full suite integrated networks, where they're using all pieces of our command center software technology. That's the goal. We think they've got the right relationships and what they'll need to do is go continue to execute on that and find more and more Yonkers. Sure. Jim. Yes, no. I was talking about 7% revenue growth in 2022 full company view and then software and services being around 10% revenue growth within that envelope. That's kind of what we see at this point in time. And then the details and more color we'd give a quarter from now. Thank you, Jim. Thank you. Listen, I just want to say thank you to the whole management team, but also to all the employees in MSI. I mean, there's so many good things going on, but it's a tough environment. I want to thank the people on the frontline, the sales organization, that's really executing well and contributing to Q3 record backlogs supply. You hear it with every company. You hear it all the time, but the supply chain environment, as we said, challenging in Q3, remains challenging in Q4. And I just think the team here in mixing and matching and there's more fluidity and uncertainty in supply chain in Q3 and Q4 than we've had in prior periods. And I think the adaptability staying in touch and close touch with key suppliers. I appreciate all that. Everybody on the support teams and back office and support functions in particularly HR and Karen Dunning and Terry Bell, because we have, it's a tough environment. We have vaccine mandate compliance requirements. We're always following rules and regulations by facility and by state and Karen and Terry, Mark Hacker phenomenal. I'm thrilled with Q3 and the results across the board. I'm proud that we're able to for three consecutive quarters' raise top and bottom line. And I think we're really well positioned going into 2022, despite the challenges we have, but we'll stick together, like we always do. We'll be flexible and will continue to be steadfast and focused. And I appreciate everybody's contribution onward and upward. And thank you everybody."

            "name": "Jack Molloy",
            "content": "Just the only other thing, I think, first of all, new product introduction, both in terms of cameras, but also moving pivoting the capability for the move to the cloud. I think also you look at it from an acquisition standpoint. We've acquired Openpath, who's really quite frankly, a game changer from the access control standpoint. This week, Tim, we announced the acquisition of Envysion. So you can look at that as a way for us to get more vertically focused in terms of our solution. And as Greg talked about in the past, one of the reasons we acquired Pelco and IndigoVision was to add greater international scale. We've invested heavily in go-to-market North America. I think the next frontier will be in Europe, Middle East, and Africa. Yes, Kyle. So to your point it's been a very good first three quarters of the year. We actually expect that performance to continue. We're sitting on record backlog of $631 million year-over-year, and that's not only historically. We'd look at that and say, that's North America phenomenon. I think the strength of the story here, it's North America performance. So it's large scale device refresh. It's statewide infrastructure upgrades. Some of which were in further discussions through ARP funding, which will play out over the course of the next few years, but also internationally, we've been in receipt of two large orders from the German defense as well as a Romanian upgrade as well. So again, we've been really pleased the performance to date. We expect that performance to continue. Paul, with body-worn so record unit shipments in Q3, really pleased with that. We've talked about as active customers, our customers want that alternative. We think we filled that really well. The other thing I'd say is, we're uniquely positioned internationally, given our scale and global presence. We talked about the French NOI they've actually put subsequent orders into Q3. Mahesh just referenced M500. So we think we're in a good position right now in body-worn car. Okay. So first of all, Greg said it earlier and I think it's always important to point out, but we're in a unique position because really what we do is all need to have, it's not nice to have. So I'd kind of decompose the American rescue plan conversation to a few different things. We have public safety and that's everything from P25 statewide and local networks to command center software. We're in pretty consistent dialogue with our customers regularly in public safety who had what we call shovel ready projects or things that maybe would have been a mid-tier kind of midterm need. And we're in conversations on how they may fund those things. Now, the other benefit is state and local receipts actually particular at the state level revenues are up as well. So Greg made a comment earlier about funding environment, the funding environment, I would say, doing business in public safety in 28 years, it's the best I've ever seen as well. So I would say, we're in a really good position there both on the P25 landscape, infrastructure upgrades and devices, as well as command center software. Our teams, the one thing our sales team does, we think they're really good at technology. We think they're better and they're experts at getting deals funded. So we think that's going to benefit us there. The second thing, I would say the other technology sleeve, that's going to benefit significantly as video security and access control. If you think about education alone, school funding, $170 billion pointed to that market, and really when kids have come back to school, the first thing they're talking about is they're talking about, how do we bring them back in a safe manner? One of the things our team did over the COVID we talked about this was to write COVID dashboard. So if you connect to a Avigilon cloud services, you get our COVID dashboard gives social distancing who went through what door. This is all really pertinent information. And we think our school superintendent, security directors are really interested in our technology here. The last thing, I would say is, there's money being pointed at airports and transit $35 billion as they reopen, many of them are upgrading both the radio networks. So we've got opportunities for PCR with all the major airlines, as well as our consoles in the command center space. And then ultimately also video security, how do they protect the perimeter security? How do they get better information? So I would say across all three of our technology continuums, as well as our services business, the money, the environment we're in a good spot. We think our sales team is poised to execute. And the last thing Fahad, I'd say on that is, you hear Greg talk a lot about acquisitions. I'll hit again on Envysion. That's approximately $25 million in recurring revenue. There you think about Openpath which is an access control recurring revenue model access control. And so there were re-envisioning that business as well. So I just -- those are other things that really are more software driven, recurring revenue model business, and that's really where we're pushing the business."

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] You will have an opportunity to ask questions after today's presentation. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference.\nTim Yocum: Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2021 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of World Wide Products Sales and Services; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Senior Vice President and CTO, Software Enterprise & Mobile Video. Greg and Jason will review our results, along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.  We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release in the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And, with that, I'll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook. First, Q2 was an excellent quarter.  We grew revenue 22%, earnings per share of 49% and operating cash flow 86% versus the prior year. Additionally, we expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with $11.2 billion of backlog up 7% versus last year and a record for Q2. Second, we saw strong demand in both segments of our business during the quarter in Products and Systems Integration. Revenue was up 44% and operating margins expanded 270 basis points, driven by growth in our LMR and video security technologies and in Software and Services revenue was up 19% and operating margins expanded by 210 basis points on growth in LMR services, video security and command center software.  This strong broad-based performance highlights the strength of our business and value of our mission critical integrated ecosystem. And finally, based on the strong backlog and momentum that we're seeing across our business, we're raising again our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share.  I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. \nJason Winkler : Thank you, Greg. Our Q2 results included revenue of $2 billion, up 22% including $47 million from acquisitions and $66 million from favorable FX. GAAP operating earnings were $370 million and operating margins were 18.8% of sales compared to 13.5% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $482 million, up $123 million or 34% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 24.4% of sales, up from 22.2% driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. Inclusive also higher costs related to employee incentive compensation this year. GAAP earnings per share of $1.69 compared to $0.78 in the year ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to increased sales volume, improved operating leverage. A lower tax rate related to the release of valuation allowance and lower reorganization charges in the current quarter.  Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.07 compared to $1.39 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. OpEx in Q2 was $477 million, up $51 million versus last year, primarily due to higher compensation-related incentives and higher expenses related to acquisitions.  Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $388 million compared with $209 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $326 million compared with $155 million in the prior year. These increases in cash flows were primarily due to higher sales and working capital improvements, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for Q2 included $121 million in cash dividends, $102 million in share repurchases, at an average price of $206.85 per share and $62 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter we issued $850 million of new long-term debt and redeemed $324 million of outstanding senior notes due in 2023. Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions for $297 million and we invested $50 million in equity securities of Evolve whose technology powers our concealed weapons detection solution.  Moving to our segment results. Q2 products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up 24%, driven by strong growth in LMR and video security. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $38 million. Operating earnings were $194 million or 16.2% of sales, up from 35.5% in the prior year and higher sales and improved operating leverage inclusive of higher costs related to incentive compensation. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include a $37 million P25 order for the Kentucky State police, our $36 million P25 upgrade for a state in the US. A $30 million P25 order from Marta in Atlanta, a $29 million P25 device order for a large US state and local customer and a $5 million video security order. Our largest single fixed video order from a US federal customer today. Moving to the Software and Services segment. Q2 revenue was $773 million, up 19% from last year, driven by growth in NMR services, video security and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $9 million. Operating earnings were $288 million or 37.2% of sales, up 210 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage and also inclusive of higher compensation-related incentives this year. Some notable Q2 wins in this segment include an $18 million French MOI body worn camera frame agreement, a $15 million license plate recognition software extension with the US based customer, a $10 million P25 multi-year services extension for Ohio's statewide network and a $10 million P25 maintenance renewal with the US federal customer.  Additionally, we launched command central suite public safety is first cloud native 911 call to case closure solution. Looking at our regional results North America Q2 revenue was $1.3 billion up 20% on growth in LMR, video security and command center software. International Q2 revenue was $659 million up 25% also driven by LMR, video security and command center software. We saw strong growth in EMEA during the quarter, while in Asia Pac, growth was minimal as the region continues to navigate impacts from COVID 19.  Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q2 record of $1.2 billion, up $741 million compared to last year, driven by $660 million of growth in North America and $81 million of growth internationally. Sequentially backlog was down $57 million driven by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN partially offset with growth in LMR products. Software and Services backlog was up $257 million compared to last year, primarily driven by North America multi-year service contracts and sequentially backlog was down $130 million driven again primarily by the revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Products and SI backlog was up $484 million [ph] compared to last year and $73 million sequentially, driven primarily by LMR growth in both regions.  Turning to our outlook, we expect Q3 sales to be approximately, up 10% with non-GAAP EPS between $2.09 and $2.14 per share. This assumes FX at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately $174 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24% and for the full year we now expect sales to be up between 9.5% and 10%, an increase from our prior guide of 8% to 9% and we now expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.88 and $8.98 per share, up from our prior guidance of $8.70 to $8.80 per share. This increased outlook incorporates the ongoing supply chain constraints, primarily in LMR and assumes FX at current rates. A weighted average share count of approximately $173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%.  I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. \nGreg Brown : Thanks, Jason. I thought I'd end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call. First our results for the quarter were excellent. We achieved Q2 record sales, operating earnings and EPS, expanded operating margins, grew our video security technologies by 66% and achieved strong growth in LMR and command center software technologies as well. Additionally, we finished the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog and a robust pipeline that we expect to drive growth for the remainder of the year. Inclusive of the continued supply chain challenges that we're navigating primarily in LMR. Second in video security demand remains strong. We've continued investing in this area, even during the early days of the pandemic and these investments have positioned us well to capture the increased demand we are now seeing from our customers. Additionally, we just announced our acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions, Openpath is disrupting the Access Control industry and extends our value proposition in the $15 billion video security market. As a result, we're also renaming the technology within our revenue disaggregation from video, security and analytics. So now video security and access control to reflect these investments and the future of video and access control convergence. And finally, as I look to the second half of the year. I'm encouraged, I'm encouraged by our execution across all of the businesses. In LMR customer are looking to invest in their networks, including several statewide upgrades and we're gaining traction with our APX NEXT device designed for the highest tier of public safety requirements. In video security and command center software, we're leveraging our large installed base and go to market footprint to drive continued strong growth. And with respect to ESG we recently released our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report, which highlights our strategy and performance. Our work in this critically important area has been recognized by Forbes, who named us as one of the best employers for diversity and Barron's who named us as one of the most sustainable companies. I'm proud of what our teams are doing and look forward to further progress as we continue to deliver mission critical solutions that create value for employees, customers communities and our shareholders.  And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. \nTim Yocum: Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tim Long from Barclays. Please go ahead. \nTim Long: Thank you. Maybe just two if I could first, could you touch a little bit on the command center software side, maybe just give us a little update on how you're penetrating the peace apps and how the kind of the suite sales are going with more than one or two software modules to the customer base. And then second on the video side, it looks like there's been a lot of traction and wins internationally on the body worn side, can you talk a little bit about the US market where I guess over the next few years. Maybe there'll be more bids coming up, so could you just talk a little bit about how you could further penetrate the US market there. Thank you. \nGreg Brown : Yes on command center software. We continue to Tim to make good progress. Our growth rate in Q2 increasing over Q1. The penetration of new customers also continues to expand from a suite standpoint. I think the number of customers in Q2, ordering the suite is comparable or about 25%. We stated last time a quarter ago. But we continue to make solid progress on multiple fronts on the command center software slide and overall I think I'm pretty pleased.\nJack Molloy: Tim, it's Jack. Hello. Maybe just to follow on to that. I think the other thing, as it relates to command center software just from an environmental standpoint I think there is some excitement both with our sales teams and our customer engagement, just in terms of our, we have an on-prem solution that we're actually have a path to the cloud for customers. I think being able to meet them for where they want to be, will be effective for us so that this closing off on that with [indiscernible] software. Mobile video just a couple of updates there Tim or with other body-worn business, so we had talked the previous three quarters that we had grown our orders north of 60%, we actually grew north of 80%. Tim we doubled our body worn cameras shipments through the first half of the year over the first half of 2020 and it looks like from the data we've looked at, and it's just early which end, but it looks like we continue to take share through Q2. \nTim Long: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nSami Badri: Hi, thank you. I have key questions. Greg, first, and maybe Jack could you give us an update on PCR. And how much that contributed to your very high growth rate and LMR in the quarter and then the second question is, I was hoping you could kind of give us more color on Openpath on how much revenues, it contributed to the business and was open profitable before you guys acquired started integrating?\nGreg Brown : So in terms of PCR you kind of taking a step back, obviously we've raised the full year again for the second time Sami. If you look at this from a segment level, our performance is strong in both segments, software and services is stronger. But also we had given color that we thought product and SI would grow mid-single digits for the full year, our raise is driven byproduct and SI now being expected to grow mid to high-single digits for the full year that stronger growth is driven primarily by video, but also by LMR. In Q2 PCR had a great quarter, strong double-digit growth, but it's also the area as Jason referenced. That's probably the most supply constrained. So if I think about SAM of your question about expectations for PCR growth over the full year. I'd like to think about it is mirroring the mid to high-single digits for the product and SI segment overall. Q2 was much stronger than that, but in the second half. We have to continue to navigate supply constraints and that's informing our expectations and guidance for full year PCR.  On Openpath, it's not profitable for the remainder of the year, full year the stub revenue period, it's probably about $5 million of incremental revenue in the second half of this year, the last five months, and it's a nickel dilutive but having said that, I am super excited by this acquisition. I think it's leading edge around cloud-based multi-factor authentication access control. I love the products. I love the architecture. I love the management team and the leadership team Mahesh was instrumental in guiding this along with Raj and John Kedzierski and couldn't be more pleased with the. I don't know if you want to mention anything, Mahesh about it. \nMahesh Saptharishi : Within the Avigilon portfolio we have always had access control, access control in fact has been one of the fastest growing product portfolios within Avigilon. It is an on-prem solution. The on-prem solution connects to third party leaders controllers and panels as appropriate. We are open is going is really a mobile first approach and a cloud native approach. The user experience that we see in the future for access control is one where authorized users never realized that the door is locked in the first place. It's friction less. It is contactless and from that standpoint Openpath complements our Avigilon access control solution well and together, I think we have a good solution going forward. \nGreg Brown : And just last item on the revenue you would asked. It's about $0.05 dilutive to EPS this year. And in $5 million in revenue in the second half.\nSami Badri: Okay, perfect. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi team, this is Eric [ph] on for Meta. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on another great quarter. Maybe sticking on some of the fixed video side when we think about that large federal deal you won, are there other federal deals in the pipeline, you're looking at now. Is that an area where demand is picking up with a lot of the federal funding and things we talked about last quarter just wondering on that and then maybe if we could also talk about the enterprise side and if open more opportunities and enterprise piece, it looked like their presence was probably stronger there. So anything on that. Thank you. \nGreg Brown : Sure. So I think the starting out, are there. Are there more big opportunities in the federal government. Yes, I would tell you the federal government is ripe with opportunities. There's opportunities by way of an NDA. There is opportunities that our go-to-market teams have created also the Pelco acquisition, if you recall from a year ago had federal contracts in place. So there's opportunities there. So the federal government as part of the overall government market is one of the three largest growth vectors for us in fixed video. The second part of your question, I believe. Eric, can you just repeat was the second part of on enterprise. \nJack Molloy : So enterprise. Yes, so just a reminder, our video security and access control business is still really roughly 70% to three quarters enterprise. So OpenPath as Mahesh very eloquently alluded to, well, I think will accelerate converged opportunities between video security and access control. Our customers more and more COVID taught us that they want the ability to remote monitor networks. They want frictionless access control. I think the marriage of those two things together will only open up more and more doors in the enterprise for us. \nGreg Brown : And Eric a quarter ago. Jack talked about fixed video government revenues being about $300 million, maybe a little bit more, I think as we sit here today. The government contribution for all in video revenue is closer now to $330 million to $340 of revenue. And again the demand we see is really strong. We had 66% growth in Q2. About 40% of that was organic and again informing our full-year raise we now expect video security technology to be, we said it was 20% plus. We now expect approximately 30% with organic growth being a little bit more than 20% of that. So really good performance by the whole portfolio.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nGeorge Notter: Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about the supply chain constraints. It's obviously a recurring theme through earning season here, but can you talk about what kind of revenue impact it might have had this quarter and then also the margin impact, and then how do you see that going forward. Thanks a lot. \nGreg Brown : Thanks for the question. So, the supply environment that we've been navigating all year is primarily around LMR and as Greg mentioned specifically most around PCR. Our supply situation did improve incrementally in Q2 and in our guidance for the second half. We've contemplated continuing to have to navigate supply chain related constraints those are factored into our full year guidance in our second half. So we expect to have to navigate through them. We're working with key suppliers. A handful of suppliers, handful of critically important parts. We're making progress. The teams are doing well. We have executive relationships that are helping us prioritize in our suppliers recognize that our equipment is critically important to first responders. So we have good success in getting prioritization.  On the cost side despite the challenging environment, we have not seen material input costs rise significantly in the first half, of course we plan every year for material cost reductions. Those are becoming more challenging to achieve that said and we didn't see a big material cost driver in the first half we'll navigate through some small increases in the second half. One area in the P&L that we are absorbing higher costs is freight if you control for the volume and the growth that we've had, we're seeing rate increases whereby the first-half absorb $20 million more than would have been expected on higher growth, which is a reflection of higher air freight, the shift to shorter supply chains elongated lead times, et cetera, which we're navigating. So that's where we've seen the one input cost rise isn't freight [ph].\nJason Winkler: Yes. And just to put a bow on it. George, I think that what's informing our full-year raise for the year is demand not necessarily any improvement in supply chain, although as Jason just talked about, I think he and his team did a very nice job in hand to hand combat working through Q2, but we have our work to do with key suppliers for the back half of the year. Again, this is primarily around PCR but I think that view is contemplated into our full year guidance.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. And then, Greg, real quickly; you mentioned the raise on expectations for the full year. I think you're getting a tailwind from FX here. Certainly, you had some in Q2. I'm not sure how much of that was already in the plan. But it feels like you're going to continue to get some benefit is that part of the full-year raise on guidance or no?\nGreg Brown : Not much, the FX benefit when you take a look at the full year was much more weighted to the first half. So that's not really driving. It's a component, but it's not as much as it was in the first half we had I think a $100 million. In the first half tailwind and if I look back half Q3, Q4 that tailwinds more like approximately 40.\nJason Winkler: So it hasn't changed much from the last time we shared those numbers, and it's always been first half tailwind more so than second half. \nGeorge Notter: Good, thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please go ahead. \nPaul Silverstein: Thanks, Greg. And Jason, I think you all had previously characterized demand is increasing month by month just quarter-by-quarter but ongoing improvement is that moderating as we proceed further and further into the ore out of the pandemic or perhaps not out of the pandemic, what are you seeing from a linearity perspective.\nGreg Brown : Well, I mean obviously in terms of overall demand, demand is strong Paul, it represents itself in Q2's results I recognize the comp of it being a COVID quarter but also guiding in Q3, a double-digit top line revenue print 9.5 to 10 is strong and that's being driven in large part by record backlog. So it's a really good demand environment, it's incrementally better and look if I take a step back, high level. I see demand strong. I see the funding environment for our customers and this is in North America centric comment, but that's where 2/3 of our revenue is and with the stimulus and $350 billion available to state and local and then other money is available to education and FEMA and other areas, there is literally hundreds of billions is available to our end user customers through the end of 2024. some of the outlying timeline. So demand is strong funding is strong backlog, backlog is at record Q2 and we're also getting traction with new products that we invested in during the downturn. And I think a lot of video security technology and that's double-digit growth rate in Q2 and the overall raised to now approximately 30% for video security technology of which over 20% is organic is driven by new product investment. We also talked about new product APX NEXT we're continuing new product on command center software both prem and cloud. New product investment inorganically with cloud-based access control. So high level Paul, again, there is a lot of work to do and we want to be easy in the saddle in the second half, and navigate these supply chain challenges, but there's a lot of positive that I see.\nJason Winkler: Paul, even in the parts of our business that are less backlog driven for example video that's about pipeline, it's about execution within the quarter and the 40% organic growth in Q2 and our outlook for now 30% growth for that business on the year is a function of higher pipeline as well as executing and delivering within the quarter on that part of the business. \nGreg Brown : The other thing that we've seen that we saw a lot of our competitors furlough selling resources during COVID. We actually continue to put the pedal to the matter hired more particularly in the video security space, and as we look back in that 12, 9 months after the fact we think without a doubt that's created great opportunity and it's created our ability to go take market share in that space. \nPaul Silverstein: Can I just follow up, the massive amount of federal work Jason that's on the docked albeit not yet passed and may not pass. Our customers are first responder agencies already talking to you about allocating funds, are they waiting for the actual dollars to flow.\nJason Winkler: So Paul what I would say is, so think of government money in two buckets there is, we don't even talk about the CARES Act money anymore, but by the way CARES Act money was available last year that we benefited from and it's available through the end of this year that we're benefiting from. I would say that the results we printed so far largely don't even include a stimulus money that I just articulated, which is $350 billion of state local, $170 billion in education, $38 billion in airport and transit et cetera, but those conversations to your question Paul are absolutely beginning to take hold with our go-to-market sales organization for both this year and multi-year planning.\nPaul Silverstein: Got it. All right. I appreciate the response. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Please go ahead. \nLouie DiPalma: Greg, Jason, Mahesh and Tim. Good afternoon. Greg, can you talk about the prevalence of the access control market for the education vertical specifically, it seems that you've invested a lot and for the education vertical with Avigilon and security with access control have increased in importance with the multitude of gun related incidents. Is this a major opportunity for Motorola and do you plan to continue be acquisitive in order to grow your share of the access control market.\nJack Molloy : So Louie, it's Jack. I'll start and I think Mahesh will have some things to add in to my comments. First of all education is one of our top, it's our second largest vertical in terms of growth right now in video security and access control. Frontend center to what every school superintendent school safety thinking about is safety of their kids. We talk about the convergence of video security and access control, but there is also the ability to converge two way radio through our safety reimagine platform that we're selling to schools. Greg just talked about the federal monies that have been, that have been pointed to schools its historic in terms of school is one of the biggest problems always had their interest, but there is an funding and now we've got interest married with funding. We also put together a specialized sales team that just talks to school superintendents every day, and we think that overlay team has helped us kind of accelerate opportunities. Mahesh, from a technology standpoint, is there anything you want to add?\nMahesh Saptharishi : I think going on that there is we just launched our Motorola Solutions concealed weapons detection solution, which is a key part of the story. When you think about it in the context of access control it's not just who are you, are you authorized to be there, but also what risk you pose. So this complements our Access Control solution really well. \nLouie DiPalma: Great, thanks. Thanks, everyone. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Trevor Bowers with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. \nTrevor Bowers: Hi guys, congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. You mentioned on the last call and also earlier today that it looks like you're taking share in the body-worn camera market, what would you say is driving the success in that space. \nGreg Brown : So, I think first of all customers want an alternative. It's been a market primarily led by one company they want an alternative. But I think in public safety trusted relationships, matter. We've been in business for as you know, over 90 years we've got trusted relationships throughout the state and local market, we also bear the advantage of having a very large international footprint and we think that's obviously been beneficial to us as well. We've got things we're working on in terms of new products both in terms of body worn cameras in terms of in-car solutions. But again, we think it's an area around police transparency and accountability, then we'll continue to get focus and funding, and we think there's an opportunity for two players in the market and we're capitalizing accordingly. Mahesh, you may.\nMahesh Saptharishi : Maybe one other thing that I would add is Jack mentioned this previously we meet our customers' needs where they are. And so having both in on-premises solution along with the cloud solution really matters here as well. And that's the other reason we win.\nTrevor Bowers: Okay, great. And then, what sort of long-term impact would you say the pandemic has had on Motorola is go-to-market approach. For example, do you expect there to be less travel and entertainment spending in the future or maybe more efficiencies as a result of new sales and delivery methods. How should we think about that going forward?\nGreg Brown : Great question. Think pivot to digital. I think digital marketing in our spend to try to get customers, particularly customers that have needs that we may be unaware of that's one. We've pivoted continue to grow our inside sales force, not only in the US but abroad. We think that's critically important and we've also just become more efficient in terms of not only our frontline selling teams but are all powerful sales engineers, how do you get more leverage and get more tactical acumen in the moments that matter with their customers and that's truly been something that we've pivoted to. With all that said we do are fairly large-scale enterprise or government sales and it's going to take some face to face engagement. So we're still going out and seeing customers but we've just driven to be more efficient and we don't think it as much about time traveling and selling time that was a legacy way to think about it, we think about and I measure our teams in terms of engagement time now and so that's really where we've seen the pivot.\nTrevor Bowers: Okay, great. Thanks a lot and congrats, again.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. \nBen Bollin: Yes, afternoon guys, thanks for taking the question. Greg, you've talked about the framing for the American Rescue Plan Act in the amount of money there, what's your perspective on when you see the sweet spot of that spending if you think about your sales cycles with how it typically flows and do you have any thoughts on how it might be influencing customer behavior in the different segments radio, surveillance, command center.\nGreg Brown : So, Ben first of all, thanks for the question. I think the sweet spot starts and I mean just very early innings in the back half of this year and it's a multi-year run. So state and local funding the $350 billion runs through December of 24, the $38 billion or $40 billion for airports and transit run through 24. There is 7 billion plus for broadband connectivity that runs through September of 30, it's a long runway. So I don't necessarily think there's going to be a part of the clutch quarter for multi-month period. I think it's going to be strong and reasonably consistent over the next few years. I think it helps, I actually think it helps across the suite of what we provide. It helps public safety LMR primarily P25 and the sustainability of multi-year service contracts that elongate these platforms that allow us to do subscriber and radio refresh like APX NEXT over a multi-year period. I think it clearly helps video whether it's fixed video ore body worn for state and local county municipalities. We talked about the benefits around education and quite frankly I think money can flow around 911 PSEP and command center software as well. So I think it's a lift for all three, hard to dimensionalize which one is more of a benefit, but it's clearly favorably to the products and solutions that we have and I like to position.\nBen Bollin: And then, a follow-up. Jason, if I could give the disaggregation of the revenue on Slide 13, could you talk a little bit about the way to think about how much of this is being recurring and also interested and if there is any variation any either average contract duration or how customers are invoicing the recurring business versus the traditional product type businesses. Thanks. \nJason Winkler: Sure. Thanks, Ben. So in terms of recurring our proxy for recurring is the segment that is software and services, which I believe this quarter was 38% of total revenues. That includes a lot of different varieties of recurring business including service renewals, subscriptions, et cetera and that was up significantly and there has been growing, as you know, even during the pandemic, and it is growing at a rate that's very positive with earnings expansion at ROE. This year, we believe now at 170 bps of OE expansion within the services, the Software and Services segment. So not only growing but expanding profitability. On the technology side you from that same disaggregation, you can see that the video is a strong driver as well as command center software and that LMR is performing well as well with up mid-single digits. \nBen Bollin: Thanks, everyone. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Fahad Najam with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. \nFahad Najam: Thank you for taking my question. So given the very favorable backdrop that you just highlighted, if I understood you correctly, glad that some of the funding from 2020 is beginning to flow through right now. But by chance [ph], some programs, like the EFG program getting funding from that we're passive calendar 2020 so we yet to see the benefit of all the ERA and the stimulus spending. Why not take the opportunity to update us on the long-term model, it clearly looks like you're 9-10 model, it's a bit conservative you probably can make it eight to ten now given the expansion in operating margin from favorable software.\nGreg Brown : Fahad, thank you. So look, this is a strong environment, demand is strong and the environment is generally favorable, but we are still in a pandemic and we see that by the way popping up, not just with the Delta variant and different policies within the US, but we've seen it in supply chain, we've seen it in factories. We've seen it another countries and we want to be prudent and mindful around the current environment that we're in and while demand is strong and funding is good and there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic and encouraged. We just want to be very mindful and aware of what we don't know and the uncertainty that I think is informing and incorporated into the remainder of the full year.  I do think that there'll be time Fahad over time to update all of you in 2022, by the way, I think that we're likely going to have an Analyst Day. We're targeting doing that in Q1 of next year as we get through this fiscal year, as we get through the large implications of the pandemic, as we get to a point where hopefully the FDA gives general approval for the vaccine. As we get to where many more populations and countries are vaccinated and herd immunity is achieved. And we just think that's a better environment to give an update at that point in time. So I'm not going to. I appreciate your interest and not going to update the model per se yet, but I like we're positioned for the back half of the year and I think we've got some good momentum to build on.\nFahad Najam: I appreciate the answer. I have follow-up question on [indiscernible]. Thank you for disclosing that government video is about $300 million. Can you give us a sense on how big mobile is and how fast could that be growing in general. It seems like it's growing even faster than your fixed video access control business?\nGreg Brown : Just two things. Video; first of all, Fahad, on the $300 million. We're now updating that today where we expect the video revenue to government customers now to be about $330 million to $340 million. We talk about the addressable market of video security and access control of being about $15 billion by the way, that's a 2021 addressable market number that grows next year that's inclusive a fixed video. It's inclusive of body-worn video. It's inclusive of in-car video and the commensurate VMS software and cloud-based revenues. So it's an all-in number remember with the acquisition of Avigilon which is fixed video. The acquisition of Pelco fixed video. The acquisition of IndigoVision fixed video that fixed video is the predominant amount of revenue contribution within the technology disaggregation that we characterize. Just to give you a reminder. \nJason Winkler: So at the total level of all video the rock split between what is fixed video and what is mobile video at the $1 billion plus the part of our business that this year is growing. We believe at 30% this year and that's our increased expectations is 70% fixed and 30% mobile. Both are growing nicely. \nFahad Najam: Can you share with us how fast is mobile is that late in the quarter. How fast is mobile growing, is it like high 15.\nGreg Brown : I would just say this in terms of data points remember, Q2 was, I know it's 66% all in, 40% little bit more was organic and Jack talked about strong double-digit 60% to 65% orders growth for body worn so that's strong growth, which is driven us taking share in the first half and given that the market is looking for a viable alternative and our product performance continues to improve and when I look at the body-worn video book of business and things like Malta or the UK or the French MOI it's pretty strong growth. \nFahad Najam: Appreciate the answers. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. \nJim Suva: Thank you. And great job really executing through such a turmoil time of COVID, supply chain issues and things like that. Looking ahead, is it possible that as hopefully we get mass immunity and COVID hopefully dies down and people return back to the office in meetings in person. Is it possible that command center business and installations could actually accelerate just because there's been so hard to meet with people and do testing and show all the bells and whistles of your solutions and also with the government stimulus is coming in or is that just not the way to think about how things could rollout in let's say the next year or two. \nGreg Brown : Jim, I would think about it that as we printed the first half of the year in Q2 and look at the second half. And basically what you're describing is the trends. I really see video security and access control, leading the way. Which is why we're raising the technology view from what we thought would be a full-year 20% plus performance to approximately 30% and that's driving the segment guide products and SI from mid-to-mid to high. So I think if you're thinking about an anchor tenant of incremental growth from current expectations of where we were. I think it's led by video security and then at the second area I'd actually say is LMR and those two areas are driving the increased momentum.  With command center software while it's our smallest component. We're still growing at greater the industry rate. So I'm pleased about that. But we also are offering both on-prem and cloud and we've got organic work to do on the internal development on cloud, but I think Jim looking forward. I think a video security access control and LMR as being more of an incremental drivers from a trend standpoint.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much and again congratulations to you and your full teams.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO for any additional or closing remarks. \nGreg Brown: Thank you everybody. Listen, I'm really pleased with Q2's results and the execution, we were able to achieve. And I just want to take the opportunity to thank my team and to thank all the people in Motorola Solutions. You delivered, you produced, you were un-flinching, you're resilient and I'm super proud of you. I think the other thing, I'm proud of is, we've continued to invest in this business. We did it in the throes of COVID last year. Jack referenced it, we continue to do that. I think in part, some of the benefits we're able to demonstrate. And the second raise of the year is driven by, in the ongoing investment decisions we've made. And last two I thought, so I like our momentum. I like the momentum as we enter this back half of the year particularly pleased with the increased strength of video security, but I'm also proud of the fact that now approximately half of our revenue for the full year will be derived from video, security and software and services and that's a much different proposition and disposition than where we were several years ago. So, I just want to thank everybody to my team. I'm proud of you and we got a lot of work to do and we know what we need to do in the back half. So thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the Internet in approximately three hours.

            "content": "Tim, it's Jack. Hello. Maybe just to follow on to that. I think the other thing, as it relates to command center software just from an environmental standpoint I think there is some excitement both with our sales teams and our customer engagement, just in terms of our, we have an on-prem solution that we're actually have a path to the cloud for customers. I think being able to meet them for where they want to be, will be effective for us so that this closing off on that with [indiscernible] software. Mobile video just a couple of updates there Tim or with other body-worn business, so we had talked the previous three quarters that we had grown our orders north of 60%, we actually grew north of 80%. Tim we doubled our body worn cameras shipments through the first half of the year over the first half of 2020 and it looks like from the data we've looked at, and it's just early which end, but it looks like we continue to take share through Q2. So enterprise. Yes, so just a reminder, our video security and access control business is still really roughly 70% to three quarters enterprise. So OpenPath as Mahesh very eloquently alluded to, well, I think will accelerate converged opportunities between video security and access control. Our customers more and more COVID taught us that they want the ability to remote monitor networks. They want frictionless access control. I think the marriage of those two things together will only open up more and more doors in the enterprise for us. So Louie, it's Jack. I'll start and I think Mahesh will have some things to add in to my comments. First of all education is one of our top, it's our second largest vertical in terms of growth right now in video security and access control.

With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of World Wide Products Sales and Services; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Senior Vice President and CTO, Software Enterprise & Mobile Video. Greg and Jason will review our results, along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.  We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release in the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And, with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. Thanks, Greg.

It is an on-prem solution. The on-prem solution connects to third party leaders controllers and panels as appropriate. We are open is going is really a mobile first approach and a cloud native approach. The user experience that we see in the future for access control is one where authorized users never realized that the door is locked in the first place. It's friction less. It is contactless and from that standpoint Openpath complements our Avigilon access control solution well and together, I think we have a good solution going forward. I think going on that there is we just launched our Motorola Solutions concealed weapons detection solution, which is a key part of the story. When you think about it in the context of access control it's not just who are you, are you authorized to be there, but also what risk you pose. So this complements our Access Control solution really well. Maybe one other thing that I would add is Jack mentioned this previously we meet our customers' needs where they are.

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook. First, Q2 was an excellent quarter.  We grew revenue 22%, earnings per share of 49% and operating cash flow 86% versus the prior year. Additionally, we expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with $11.2 billion of backlog up 7% versus last year and a record for Q2. Second, we saw strong demand in both segments of our business during the quarter in Products and Systems Integration. Revenue was up 44% and operating margins expanded 270 basis points, driven by growth in our LMR and video security technologies and in Software and Services revenue was up 19% and operating margins expanded by 210 basis points on growth in LMR services, video security and command center software.  This strong broad-based performance highlights the strength of our business and value of our mission critical integrated ecosystem. And finally, based on the strong backlog and momentum that we're seeing across our business, we're raising again our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share.  I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thanks, Jason. I thought I'd end with a few thoughts as we conclude the call. First our results for the quarter were excellent. We achieved Q2 record sales, operating earnings and EPS, expanded operating margins, grew our video security technologies by 66% and achieved strong growth in LMR and command center software technologies as well. Additionally, we finished the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog and a robust pipeline that we expect to drive growth for the remainder of the year. Inclusive of the continued supply chain challenges that we're navigating primarily in LMR. Second in video security demand remains strong. We've continued investing in this area, even during the early days of the pandemic and these investments have positioned us well to capture the increased demand we are now seeing from our customers. Additionally, we just announced our acquisition of Openpath, a leader in cloud-based access control solutions, Openpath is disrupting the Access Control industry and extends our value proposition in the $15 billion video security market. As a result, we're also renaming the technology within our revenue disaggregation from video, security and analytics. So now video security and access control to reflect these investments and the future of video and access control convergence. And finally, as I look to the second half of the year. I'm encouraged, I'm encouraged by our execution across all of the businesses. In LMR customer are looking to invest in their networks, including several statewide upgrades and we're gaining traction with our APX NEXT device designed for the highest tier of public safety requirements. In video security and command center software, we're leveraging our large installed base and go to market footprint to drive continued strong growth. And with respect to ESG we recently released our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report, which highlights our strategy and performance. Our work in this critically important area has been recognized by Forbes, who named us as one of the best employers for diversity and Barron's who named us as one of the most sustainable companies. I'm proud of what our teams are doing and look forward to further progress as we continue to deliver mission critical solutions that create value for employees, customers communities and our shareholders.  And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Yes on command center software. We continue to Tim to make good progress. Our growth rate in Q2 increasing over Q1. The penetration of new customers also continues to expand from a suite standpoint. I think the number of customers in Q2, ordering the suite is comparable or about 25%. We stated last time a quarter ago. But we continue to make solid progress on multiple fronts on the command center software slide and overall I think I'm pretty pleased. So in terms of PCR you kind of taking a step back, obviously we've raised the full year again for the second time Sami. If you look at this from a segment level, our performance is strong in both segments, software and services is stronger. But also we had given color that we thought product and SI would grow mid-single digits for the full year, our raise is driven byproduct and SI now being expected to grow mid to high-single digits for the full year that stronger growth is driven primarily by video, but also by LMR. In Q2 PCR had a great quarter, strong double-digit growth, but it's also the area as Jason referenced. That's probably the most supply constrained. So if I think about SAM of your question about expectations for PCR growth over the full year. I'd like to think about it is mirroring the mid to high-single digits for the product and SI segment overall. Q2 was much stronger than that, but in the second half. We have to continue to navigate supply constraints and that's informing our expectations and guidance for full year PCR.  On Openpath, it's not profitable for the remainder of the year, full year the stub revenue period, it's probably about $5 million of incremental revenue in the second half of this year, the last five months, and it's a nickel dilutive but having said that, I am super excited by this acquisition. I think it's leading edge around cloud-based multi-factor authentication access control. I love the products. I love the architecture. I love the management team and the leadership team Mahesh was instrumental in guiding this along with Raj and John Kedzierski and couldn't be more pleased with the. I don't know if you want to mention anything, Mahesh about it. And just last item on the revenue you would asked. It's about $0.05 dilutive to EPS this year. And in $5 million in revenue in the second half. Sure. So I think the starting out, are there. Are there more big opportunities in the federal government. Yes, I would tell you the federal government is ripe with opportunities. There's opportunities by way of an NDA. There is opportunities that our go-to-market teams have created also the Pelco acquisition, if you recall from a year ago had federal contracts in place. So there's opportunities there. So the federal government as part of the overall government market is one of the three largest growth vectors for us in fixed video. The second part of your question, I believe. Eric, can you just repeat was the second part of on enterprise. And Eric a quarter ago. Jack talked about fixed video government revenues being about $300 million, maybe a little bit more, I think as we sit here today. The government contribution for all in video revenue is closer now to $330 million to $340 of revenue. And again the demand we see is really strong. We had 66% growth in Q2. About 40% of that was organic and again informing our full-year raise we now expect video security technology to be, we said it was 20% plus. We now expect approximately 30% with organic growth being a little bit more than 20% of that. So really good performance by the whole portfolio. Thanks for the question. So, the supply environment that we've been navigating all year is primarily around LMR and as Greg mentioned specifically most around PCR. Our supply situation did improve incrementally in Q2 and in our guidance for the second half. We've contemplated continuing to have to navigate supply chain related constraints those are factored into our full year guidance in our second half. So we expect to have to navigate through them. We're working with key suppliers. A handful of suppliers, handful of critically important parts. We're making progress. The teams are doing well. We have executive relationships that are helping us prioritize in our suppliers recognize that our equipment is critically important to first responders. So we have good success in getting prioritization.  On the cost side despite the challenging environment, we have not seen material input costs rise significantly in the first half, of course we plan every year for material cost reductions. Those are becoming more challenging to achieve that said and we didn't see a big material cost driver in the first half we'll navigate through some small increases in the second half. One area in the P&L that we are absorbing higher costs is freight if you control for the volume and the growth that we've had, we're seeing rate increases whereby the first-half absorb $20 million more than would have been expected on higher growth, which is a reflection of higher air freight, the shift to shorter supply chains elongated lead times, et cetera, which we're navigating. So that's where we've seen the one input cost rise isn't freight [ph]. Not much, the FX benefit when you take a look at the full year was much more weighted to the first half. So that's not really driving. It's a component, but it's not as much as it was in the first half we had I think a $100 million. In the first half tailwind and if I look back half Q3, Q4 that tailwinds more like approximately 40. Well, I mean obviously in terms of overall demand, demand is strong Paul, it represents itself in Q2's results I recognize the comp of it being a COVID quarter but also guiding in Q3, a double-digit top line revenue print 9.5 to 10 is strong and that's being driven in large part by record backlog. So it's a really good demand environment, it's incrementally better and look if I take a step back, high level. I see demand strong. I see the funding environment for our customers and this is in North America centric comment, but that's where 2/3 of our revenue is and with the stimulus and $350 billion available to state and local and then other money is available to education and FEMA and other areas, there is literally hundreds of billions is available to our end user customers through the end of 2024. some of the outlying timeline. So demand is strong funding is strong backlog, backlog is at record Q2 and we're also getting traction with new products that we invested in during the downturn. And I think a lot of video security technology and that's double-digit growth rate in Q2 and the overall raised to now approximately 30% for video security technology of which over 20% is organic is driven by new product investment. We also talked about new product APX NEXT we're continuing new product on command center software both prem and cloud. New product investment inorganically with cloud-based access control. So high level Paul, again, there is a lot of work to do and we want to be easy in the saddle in the second half, and navigate these supply chain challenges, but there's a lot of positive that I see. The other thing that we've seen that we saw a lot of our competitors furlough selling resources during COVID. We actually continue to put the pedal to the matter hired more particularly in the video security space, and as we look back in that 12, 9 months after the fact we think without a doubt that's created great opportunity and it's created our ability to go take market share in that space. So, I think first of all customers want an alternative. It's been a market primarily led by one company they want an alternative. But I think in public safety trusted relationships, matter. We've been in business for as you know, over 90 years we've got trusted relationships throughout the state and local market, we also bear the advantage of having a very large international footprint and we think that's obviously been beneficial to us as well. We've got things we're working on in terms of new products both in terms of body worn cameras in terms of in-car solutions. But again, we think it's an area around police transparency and accountability, then we'll continue to get focus and funding, and we think there's an opportunity for two players in the market and we're capitalizing accordingly. Mahesh, you may. Great question. Think pivot to digital. I think digital marketing in our spend to try to get customers, particularly customers that have needs that we may be unaware of that's one. We've pivoted continue to grow our inside sales force, not only in the US but abroad. We think that's critically important and we've also just become more efficient in terms of not only our frontline selling teams but are all powerful sales engineers, how do you get more leverage and get more tactical acumen in the moments that matter with their customers and that's truly been something that we've pivoted to. With all that said we do are fairly large-scale enterprise or government sales and it's going to take some face to face engagement. So we're still going out and seeing customers but we've just driven to be more efficient and we don't think it as much about time traveling and selling time that was a legacy way to think about it, we think about and I measure our teams in terms of engagement time now and so that's really where we've seen the pivot. So, Ben first of all, thanks for the question. I think the sweet spot starts and I mean just very early innings in the back half of this year and it's a multi-year run. So state and local funding the $350 billion runs through December of 24, the $38 billion or $40 billion for airports and transit run through 24. There is 7 billion plus for broadband connectivity that runs through September of 30, it's a long runway. So I don't necessarily think there's going to be a part of the clutch quarter for multi-month period. I think it's going to be strong and reasonably consistent over the next few years. I think it helps, I actually think it helps across the suite of what we provide. It helps public safety LMR primarily P25 and the sustainability of multi-year service contracts that elongate these platforms that allow us to do subscriber and radio refresh like APX NEXT over a multi-year period. I think it clearly helps video whether it's fixed video ore body worn for state and local county municipalities. We talked about the benefits around education and quite frankly I think money can flow around 911 PSEP and command center software as well. So I think it's a lift for all three, hard to dimensionalize which one is more of a benefit, but it's clearly favorably to the products and solutions that we have and I like to position. Fahad, thank you. So look, this is a strong environment, demand is strong and the environment is generally favorable, but we are still in a pandemic and we see that by the way popping up, not just with the Delta variant and different policies within the US, but we've seen it in supply chain, we've seen it in factories. We've seen it another countries and we want to be prudent and mindful around the current environment that we're in and while demand is strong and funding is good and there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic and encouraged. We just want to be very mindful and aware of what we don't know and the uncertainty that I think is informing and incorporated into the remainder of the full year.  I do think that there'll be time Fahad over time to update all of you in 2022, by the way, I think that we're likely going to have an Analyst Day. We're targeting doing that in Q1 of next year as we get through this fiscal year, as we get through the large implications of the pandemic, as we get to a point where hopefully the FDA gives general approval for the vaccine. As we get to where many more populations and countries are vaccinated and herd immunity is achieved. And we just think that's a better environment to give an update at that point in time. So I'm not going to. I appreciate your interest and not going to update the model per se yet, but I like we're positioned for the back half of the year and I think we've got some good momentum to build on. Just two things. Video; first of all, Fahad, on the $300 million. We're now updating that today where we expect the video revenue to government customers now to be about $330 million to $340 million. We talk about the addressable market of video security and access control of being about $15 billion by the way, that's a 2021 addressable market number that grows next year that's inclusive a fixed video. It's inclusive of body-worn video. It's inclusive of in-car video and the commensurate VMS software and cloud-based revenues. So it's an all-in number remember with the acquisition of Avigilon which is fixed video. The acquisition of Pelco fixed video. The acquisition of IndigoVision fixed video that fixed video is the predominant amount of revenue contribution within the technology disaggregation that we characterize. Just to give you a reminder. I would just say this in terms of data points remember, Q2 was, I know it's 66% all in, 40% little bit more was organic and Jack talked about strong double-digit 60% to 65% orders growth for body worn so that's strong growth, which is driven us taking share in the first half and given that the market is looking for a viable alternative and our product performance continues to improve and when I look at the body-worn video book of business and things like Malta or the UK or the French MOI it's pretty strong growth. Jim, I would think about it that as we printed the first half of the year in Q2 and look at the second half. And basically what you're describing is the trends. I really see video security and access control, leading the way. Which is why we're raising the technology view from what we thought would be a full-year 20% plus performance to approximately 30% and that's driving the segment guide products and SI from mid-to-mid to high. So I think if you're thinking about an anchor tenant of incremental growth from current expectations of where we were. I think it's led by video security and then at the second area I'd actually say is LMR and those two areas are driving the increased momentum.  With command center software while it's our smallest component. We're still growing at greater the industry rate. So I'm pleased about that. But we also are offering both on-prem and cloud and we've got organic work to do on the internal development on cloud, but I think Jim looking forward. I think a video security access control and LMR as being more of an incremental drivers from a trend standpoint. Thank you everybody. Listen, I'm really pleased with Q2's results and the execution, we were able to achieve. And I just want to take the opportunity to thank my team and to thank all the people in Motorola Solutions. You delivered, you produced, you were un-flinching, you're resilient and I'm super proud of you. I think the other thing, I'm proud of is, we've continued to invest in this business. We did it in the throes of COVID last year. Jack referenced it, we continue to do that. I think in part, some of the benefits we're able to demonstrate. And the second raise of the year is driven by, in the ongoing investment decisions we've made. And last two I thought, so I like our momentum. I like the momentum as we enter this back half of the year particularly pleased with the increased strength of video security, but I'm also proud of the fact that now approximately half of our revenue for the full year will be derived from video, security and software and services and that's a much different proposition and disposition than where we were several years ago. So, I just want to thank everybody to my team. I'm proud of you and we got a lot of work to do and we know what we need to do in the back half. So thank you."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of this call over the Internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] You will have an opportunity to ask questions after today's presentation. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference.\nTim Yocum: Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2021 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; A - Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Products and Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President, Software and Services. Greg and Jason will review our results, along with commentary, and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A. We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release in the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And, with that, I'll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook. First, Q1 was an excellent quarter. We achieved Q1 records for sales, operating earnings, and cash flow. We expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with backlog of $11.3 billion up 8% versus last year. Additionally demand remains strong resulting in orders that were higher than any other first quarter in our history. Second, our Software and Services segment had another outstanding quarter and continues to drive revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Sales for the quarter were up 15% driven by growth across our LMR, video security, and command center software technologies and this segment also finished with operating margins up 310 basis points versus last year. And finally, based on the increased demand we're seeing across our business and our strong backlog position, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share for the full year. I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Our Q1 results included revenue of 1.8 billion, up 7% including $48 million from acquisitions and $32 million from favorable currency. GAAP operating earnings of $298 million and operating margins of 16.8% of sales compared to 15.6% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $411 million up $64 million or 18% and non-GAAP operating margins of 23.5% of sales, up from 21% driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 compared to $1.12 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved operating leverage, and lower legal fees partially offset by the gain from the sale of a manufacturing facility recognized in the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.87 compared to $1.49 last year primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. Higher pension income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. OpEx in Q1 was $455 million up $4 million versus last year, primarily due to costs related to acquisitions, partially offset by lower discretionary spend. Turning to cash flow. Our Q1 operating cash flow was $370 million compared with $308 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $318 million compared with $260 million in the prior year. The increasing cash flow was primarily due to higher sales and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for Q1 included 170 million of share repurchases at an average price of $175.53 million, $121 million in cash dividends and $52 million of CapEx. During the quarter, we entered into a new five-year $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, replacing our prior $2.2 billion facility and subsequent to quarter-end the Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program. Moving to our segment results. Q1 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1 billion, up 2% primarily driven by growth in video security and professional and commercial radio partially offset by lower sales of public safety LMR, which were impacted by supply constraints. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $35 million. Operating earnings were $131 million or 12.9% of sales up from 12.4% in the year prior on higher sales and improved leverage. Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment, include a $300 million frame agreement with the German MOD to meet their TETRA LMR requirements with an initial order of $154 million recorded in Q1. $72 million of video sales with government customers up 32% from last year, a $37 million P25 upgrade for government agency in Canada, a $33 million TETRA upgrade for large customer in Europe and a $12 million P25 order with the large US Federal customer. Moving to the Software and Services segment. Q1 revenue was $758 million, up 15% from last year driven by growth in LMR services, video security, and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $13 million. Operating earnings were $280 million or 36.9% of sales, up 310 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved leverage. Some notable Q1 wins in the segment, include $40 million of orders for P25 services, upgrades and body-worn cameras with Nashville, Tennessee. A $35 million Push-to-Talk over broadband multi-year contract with a large US customer. A $22 million P25 and Push-to-Talk over broadband contract from a large Middle Eastern customer. $13 million of body-worn cameras with multiple UK customers and our largest cloud-based command center software win to-date. A $5 million contract with St. Lucie Florida. Additionally, we announced a new product integration between our V3100 body-worn camera and our APX P25 radio platform. Looking at our regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 6% and growth in LMR, video security, and command center software. International Q1 revenue of $588 million was up 9% with growth in EMEA, Asia Pac, and Latin America. The growth was driven by video security and LMR. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $11.3 billion, up $866 million compared to last year driven by $639 million of growth in North America and $227 million of growth internationally. Sequentially backlog was down $130 million driven by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts partially offset with international growth in LMR products. Software and Services backlog was up $548 million compared to last year, driven by $491 million of growth in multi-year LMR services and command center software contracts in North America and $58 million of international software growth. The favorable impact of FX to backlog was offset by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Sequentially backlog was down $269 million also driven by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Products and SI backlog was $318 million compared up $318 million compared to last year primarily driven by LMR growth in both regions. Sequentially, backlog was up $139 million driven by international LMR growth. Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up between 19% and 20% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.90 per share and $1.95 per share. This assumes FX at current spot rates, weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. And for the full year we now expect sales to be up between 8% and 9%, an increase from our prior guide of 7.25% to 8% and we expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.70 per share and $8.80 per share up from our prior guidance of $8.50 per share to $8.62 per share. This increased outlook includes the ongoing supply chain constraints primarily in LMR products and assumes FX at current spot rates, a weighted average diluted share count of 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Jason, thanks, and now I'd like to end with a few thoughts on the business. First, our results for the quarter were outstanding. We achieved Q1 record sales, orders, operating earnings, and cash flow expanded both gross and operating margins, achieved double-digit growth in video security, command center software and LMR services and our PCR business returned to growth. Additionally, we exited the quarter with a record Q1 backlog and continued strong demand that we expect will drive growth for the remainder of the year inclusive of the supply challenges that we have. We also announced today that the Board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program. The second thing I would say is demand in our video security business is really strong and we now expect full year growth to be 20% plus up from the high teens we referenced on our last call. In fixed video, which makes up approximately 70% of the total video security revenue. Our investments in AI analytics, cloud services, access control and NDAA-compliant manufacturing is differentiating us from our competitors and driving growth faster than the overall market. And in mobile video, the call for more transparency is driving growth for our purpose-built body-worn and in-car camera solutions and we're gaining share in a market that has predominantly been served by one vendor. During the quarter, we had several large body-worn camera wins both in the US and internationally. Just this morning, we announced a $17.5 million contract to provide about 30,000 body-worn cameras to the French Ministry of Interior. Additionally, during the quarter, we announced two new offerings. The integration of our V3100 body-worn camera with our APX P25 radios, which allow us to leverage our market leading LMR installed base and our $49 per month body-worn camera as a service offering, which offers every police agency in the US with affordable access to a video solution that's fully integrated with our command central software suite. And finally, I'm very pleased with our progress in leveraging our leading installed base in LMR to expand in the command center software, video security, and LMR services. Today, almost half our revenue is generated from these higher-growth areas up from 20% five years ago and our addressable market has tripled over that same period of time. And while we've made significant progress, I absolutely believe we still have a long runway ahead as we continue to deploy capital both organically and inorganically in these areas to drive revenue, margin, and cash flow for the company. And, with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and look forward to your questions.\nTim Yocum: Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTim Long: Thank you. Two questions if I could both on the video business. Greg, could you talk a little bit, give us an update on how the move into more of the public safety verticals with all of the video offerings is going where are we in that process and how much traction you're seeing there. And then second maybe for Greg or Jack talk a little bit about the body-worn area. It does seem like you guys are seeing more traction there and making a little bit more of a focus. Can you talk a little bit about kind of go-to-market sales force push there and if you could just remind us also for that business how important and how meaningful is kind of the software on the back end of the actual body-worn camera sale? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim. I'm pleased with the video security business in total. Both fixed video and mobile. I think Molloy and Kedzierski and the entire team has done a great job on investing in additional go-to-market, refreshing the product portfolio both in fixed video, body-worn camera, and mobile video. As I mentioned, also I think the secret sauce for us is to not just have great products in video, but also the integration and orchestration of that with the installed base that we have with thousands of LMR and PCR networks around the world. I'm thrilled with the progress in body-worn camera, both domestically and internationally. We had the big announcement this morning with the French Ministry of Interior. But we're taking share. We're clearly I think we've been doing that since late last year, the second half of 2020, and it's pretty clear as well that we're taking share and we took share in Q1 and Jack may want to talk about the progress in public safety as well which I'm pleased with.\nJack Molloy: Sure. Yes. Just maybe one point to follow on top of Greg's. First of all, as it relates to body-worn. If you look at the data that was just released by our competitor Exxon and ourselves. They grew their shipment 16% in Q1 that 7,000 units in an absolute perspective whereby we grew body-worn shipments a 104%, which is 11,500 units. So I think that's indicative of the share we've taken. The second thing, Tim, I think you talked about in general our video business into government and if you remember that was a largely nascent business for us just a few years ago, will eclipse $300 million to start there, and I think that really plays on as Greg said both strength in fixed and mobile. And I think we stand at the intersection of two really important things, transparency and government efficiency. The last thing I'd close with is the American Rescue Plan puts us in play for multi-year tailwinds as it relates to incremental public safety spend, spend around education, we're fixing schools with both video security and access control as well. So, I feel good as Greg said just to reiterate a few of those points and add a little deeper, but feel good all-in on government.\nGreg Brown: And, Tim, just on software, which is your last part of your question on what -- how that plays into it. This past quarter, you may have seen we announced our CC command central evidence platform, which is our new Azure-based cloud platform, which works seamlessly with all of our body-worn video to help manage the body-worn video and in-car video that comes in and that's important because it doesn't just work with our body-worn video, it also works seamlessly with the whole command center software suite that we have, evidence being managing the body-worn video, but it integrates seamlessly with the entirety of our records platform as well. So they all play together and work well together and we're making the investments across the board as Jack referenced on body-worn and of course also on the software that handles at the back end.\nTim Long: Okay, thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thank you, Tim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. I just want to start obviously a very strong Q1, Greg, record backlog as I think on a forward basis, it seemed to be good conditions for the PCR business to continue to recover anything from stimulus might be incremental and then looking at the full-year guidance, the back half growth is around 5% year-over-year and it's more muted seasonality. Just seems like the environment might be healthier than normal from the macro standpoint. So maybe you could touch on the offsets that would cause more muted growth for the full year. And I recognize, I'm getting greedy, but I have to ask.\nGreg Brown: No, Adam, look I think the environment is very healthy and the demand is very strong. I think that's indicated by the record Q1 that I outlined in a number of categories and the robustness and the strength of the backlog that we're exiting Q1 as well. Now having said that, right, if you look at first half, second half growth, obviously first half growth for us this year is very high. It's a bit distorted for us and other companies, given the Q2 pronounced COVID effect, but nonetheless, I'm very happy with what we did in Q1. I'm pleased with how we're guiding Q2 and I remind you, Adam, also 90 million of FX favorability is in the first half. It's more like 38 million to 40 million in the second half, but also as it relates to supply, we're still operating under the current environment, which is generally comparable to what it was when we talk to you a quarter ago. Although, I would point out, while it remains challenging, the team did a nice job working with some key suppliers pulling forward key components to execute and print Q1. They're also doing it again, which is informing and driving a very healthy guide in Q2. So while the supply environment remains challenging, we will look to continue on those improvements in the back half, but at this point in time, and given the fact that the pandemic is still there, which I thought it was a prudent guide.\nAdam Tindle: Understood. Makes sense. Just as a follow-up. I did want to ask, you touched on video, which is very healthy. I did want to ask on command center software. If I look in the slides correctly, I think that grew around 13% year-over-year, previously you had talked about a goal of 20%. So maybe just color on delta in the quarter, is this just lumpiness and I'm wondering how to think about growth rate of that moving forward. Do you think you'll catch up to that 20% or should we be thinking about attenuating that for now?\nKelly Mark: Adam, it's Kelly. The answer is yes. We're still tracking to the 20%. We're pleased with the growth we got, the 30% in Q1, but as we come into the back half of the year, the growth rates associated with Q2 through Q4 will benefit from the softer comps of what we saw in 2020 on COVID impact and not to mention the other thing is we have some very large NGCS deals, which we won last year that will start contributing revenue in the back half of the year. So going to the approximately 20% is something that we are still targeting.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. I appreciate it. Sorry, I mean, problem with my phone. Maybe if we could just spend a second on just any -- you mentioned you're having good -- you're mitigating supply chain issues, but just whether any overhang on margins. And just some of these stimulus plans are being rolled out, what do you think will be the cadence of -- are you seeing kind of front-loaded investment as the stimulus funds like backloaded investment or do you think it will be more mitigated throughout the year?\nGreg Brown: Yes, Meta. So as we look kind of at the full year and from a margin perspective for the company, from a gross margin standpoint. I think they will be comparable maybe slightly up and that includes probably the gross margin profile for the segments as well products as well as software and services. If you take operating margins, we're now anticipating operating margin expansion in software and services to be up about 140 basis points. That's an increase from what we've talked about a quarter ago by 40 basis points and we expect product segment operating margins to grow as well more commensurate with volume. In terms of the demand environment, I think, it's partially pent-up demand. I think things are reopening as the pandemic depending upon the geography relieves itself and the economy starts to get back into a strong rhythm of expansion. From a stimulus standpoint, there is a lot of money available to our customers, particularly on the public safety side both around the CARES Act, which was already in place for 2020 and continues on through 2021 as well as the American Rescue Plan, which is new available money in the Biden $1.9 trillion Plan. There is $350 billion for state and local funding. There is a $170 billion for school funding. There is $38 billion for airports and transit. There is a lot of money. The other important thing is that these funds are available for about the next 3 years to 3.5 years. So our customers will have available grant money, the environments remaining strong and gets stronger in public safety. The PCR business on the enterprise side grew at 8% in Q1 and we are reaffirming its growth all in for this year. So I like the position we're in and I like the signals we're seeing.\nJason Winkler: One thing I'd add on the input costs. We're not seeing measurable increases on inputs. The one area where we've had to navigate is higher freight costs and moving things to the ocean off of what had been freight, air freight, which are very high. So that's leading to slightly higher inventory for the time being, but we'll navigate through those but as Greg said more opportunities there.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks.\nGreg Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nLouie DiPalma: Good afternoon. Can you talk about your strategy for the education vertical and what you are seeing there in terms of demand?\nJack Molloy: Sure. Louie, hi, it's Jack. The education vertical, it's interesting, because Greg just talked about the American Rescue Plan. There is $170 billion directed to school funding that runs through September 23. So we've really got a duality of opportunities with education. The biggest opportunity we have with education is in our fixed video, security, and access control business. Simply put, it's been one of our highest growing verticals in that business. We not only have a regional sales team, but we have a group of business development vertical specialists that focus and work out with schools on directing funding in those kind of things. So we're really pleased there, but we also work and do -- we have a safety reimagine campaign going on that actually pulls together fixed video security and PCR and that message resonates very well. So think about you get an intrusion on a door access control, sends a signal to a PCR radio whereby every teacher might have one and the level of security that enhances that schools has been impressive. And I think resonates with our customers. So we're really excited actually in my career here this is probably the best opportunity set we've had in education.\nGreg Brown: And, Louie, the other key around that is in addition to what Jack said, think automation, think analytics, think integration. So as the Motorola Solutions Critical Infrastructure on fixed video, mobile video, land mobile radio, perimeter detection, backpack, delinquent student, inappropriate trucking on a parking lot. All of that would be automated. As Jack said not only sends an alert to the radio, but also can automatically alert in command central aware, a 911 dispatch operator as well. So we're leveraging the installed base capitalizing on the new fixed video architecture targeting safe schools and integrating and automating all of the technology we have to differentiate in an offering that we don't think anyone else can provide.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. So it's not just Avigilon, it's the broad suite of products.\nGreg Brown: Exactly.\nLouie DiPalma: You're bundling with the analytics and I think you mentioned the PCR radios as well. Got you.\nGreg Brown: Yes, and our CTO Mahesh who came with us to -- from us to the -- from the acquisition of Avigilon to Motorola has been critical in the orchestration software work and integration work to make all these technologies seamlessly work together.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. Yes I saw him give a presentation for your investment and Evolve technologies.\nGreg Brown: Right. And with Evolve that gives us another investment around access control. We were in investor earlier probably a year or two ago with Evolve. We're committed to make a future investments. It's a little bit more consequential. And so when you think about critical infrastructure locations like schools or stadiums or airports or hospitals Evolve and that partnership around weapons detection is another interesting component to integrate into the suite as we develop our product portfolio and think about a differentiated operating going forward.\nLouie DiPalma: Sounds good. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nPaul Silverstein: Thanks. I appreciate you taking the questions. First just a clarification. I apologize what you stated and I misheard, but Greg I think I heard you say that you're confirming growth for PCR for the full year, but I didn't hear what that growth was?\nGreg Brown: We are confirming it for the full year, Paul. I mentioned that it grew 8% in Q1. We didn't give a specific number, but it wouldn't surprise me if the full year growth is generally commensurate with that kind of number, but I like the signals that are coming back from that business.\nPaul Silverstein: All right. I'm glad to hear that I'm actually paying attention. So can you give a number, but it always encouraging. But on a serious note, any incremental insight you can give in terms of recovery where all we can read the paper and see in the news that oil and gas and transportation and hospitality were all reopening, there's talk about cruise ships eventually sailing although that hasn't happened yet. I trust you're seeing ongoing improvement and if I may a question for you on your video security in the public sector. So now that it's on a $300 million or over $300 million utilized run rate in a normal Geoffrey Moore crossing the chasm adoption cycle, one would expect or I would expect that to accelerate as that number becomes meaningful. And I don't know if that's a 300. I know you just said 20% up from 15% previously, but should we expect as time goes on you had further acceleration with the benefit of critical mass?\nGreg Brown: Well, critical mass, Paul is certainly a benefit as we get greater density and it's kind of a nucleus for a flywheel of growth. We did raise our outlook today on the video security technologies all into 20% plus growth for fiscal 2021 up from high teens. I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate into 2022 necessarily. It's a little too early for that, but the markers are good. The momentum is good. The product portfolio is getting refreshed and the investments that are being made and we're taking share. We're taking share both in the fixed video component. We're taking share in the body-worn camera component. And I also believe that access control and the integration of access control with video security is also a nice opportunity for us as it relates to the individual enterprise verticals that are recovering from PCR perspective maybe Jack can provide a little bit on that front.\nJack Molloy: Yes. So internationally those markets have still been slow to rebound. We have seen, I would say, very measured and slight improvements in oil and gas earlier this year really even in Q4 last year, we started to see some recovery. Hospitality in general is still slow. I would say in the Southeast and through the Southwest, it's a little better, but it's still been slow, we think those things will improve in Q2 into Q3.\nGreg Brown: And just thread the two points on growth. Last year's video business for us in total was $926 million, that's the business that we're talking about growing at 20% plus in this year of '21. Jack's comments earlier were about the 300 million of that, that's anticipated this year to be from specifically government, and that's a part of the business that was very nascent just three or four years ago and was part of our thesis in penetrating the Avigilon portfolio into our legacy accounts and we're doing that.\nPaul Silverstein: Understood. I appreciate the responses.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle McNeely from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKyle McNeely: Hi. This is Kyle on for George Notter. Thanks a lot for the question. This is somewhat similar to the video question you just answered, but you talked about some of the recovering verticals, but can you talk a little bit about the verticals that are driving that growth for you to take it up from high teens to 20%. There's a lot of the government, I would assume, but is there other enterprises, retail, schools. I believe you mentioned there's casinos, hotels and then is the international play here too or just the US. Could you kind of give us some clarity on how you're playing internationally and how that's doing versus domestic? Thanks.\nJason Winkler: Yes. So for fixed video, the growth drivers really fundamentally been through the first part of this year is North America. We talked about North America, go-to-market coverage, that's paid big dividends. I would also tell you internationally every theater grew. We've done a really nice job in growing international key accounts, that's also a growth driver, and we start to think about from a technology standpoint, it's really been driven by a strength in analytics refresh, camera refreshes and I'd have to hit it again, but the government vertical as well as education continue to be a benefit not only Avigilon, but also the Pelco acquisition, which have helped us in the federal government's leave as well.\nKyle McNeely: Okay, great. And then it's also nice to hear some recovery in the PCR business. I'm wondering if you could comment about the trajectory past this year and whether you have line of sight to when it might recover to the $1 billion run rate, it was pre-COVID. Is that a little too far off to predict or can you give us kind of a timeframe on when you might get back to that previous run rate?\nGreg Brown: Well, I would just say this, it is probably too early to predict on that front, but through Q1 and actually quarter-to-date from an orders and bookings standpoint, the trend is very good. Now I'm not going to declare an endpoint of when we return to that level, but I would simply say it's certainly ahead of the expectations that we had a quarter ago when we had the full-year view. And I'd also say, even though we're operating in a supply constrained environment, our channel partners have done a good job, managing this and handling and balancing the inventory levels that they hold to satisfy their customers, but the signals are strong, certainly stronger, I thought they would be good for PCR as you heard me say I thought PCR would return to growth in 2021. We're off to a very good start, orders are strong, and they're probably ahead of my expectations of where we are as we sit here in May, but we'll update you again in August, but it's very good.\nJason Winkler: The other encouraging sign is that we saw a good product launch in Ion and a good reception from that very important part of the portfolio that was released recently and seeing good take rates.\nJack Molloy: And the only other thing, Jason, I'd piggyback on that is also we've talked about our distance learning. We talked about monies that have been available for broadband investments and schools are investing in distance learning. We've talked about four big school districts last year. We've replicated that in Q1 and there continue to be a drumbeat of interest and a lot of those upgrades happen during the summer months. So we're actually very excited about our private LTE, Nitro solution as well.\nKyle McNeely: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nGreg Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.\nTrevor Bowers: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Trevor filling in for Keith. With the American Rescue Plan, you mentioned earlier that customers will have access to that money for the next few years. Have you seen any impact yet on the sales pipeline or is it too early?\nGreg Brown: Yes, we have. It's a really good question. We've seen the team -- kind of a -- in a joking way, but you give salespeople and pass the money good salespeople and they go find it and we've had discussions already public safety engagements right away for the state and local funding we've been engaged with schools, but also airports and transits when they've had a little bit of downtime, they're doing some planning as well. Now that they know they've got funding available.\nTrevor Bowers: Okay, great. And maybe a quick follow-up. How would you characterize the sales cycle? Has that returned to normal yet or not so much?\nGreg Brown: I would say the sales cycle here as we sit in 2021, I would caveat it, in North America, it's largely return to normal, both in terms of government and in terms of our PCR business, which is focused in the enterprise. Europe has been very slow. Borders are still slow down. A lot of it's virtual. Parts of Asia return back to normal and COVID is running through Latin American and things and engagements very slow there, but in North America things have returned very much close to normal.\nTrevor Bowers: Okay, great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Trevor.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Fahad Najam from MKM Partners. Your line is now open.\nFahad Najam: Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned supply chain couple of time. Was there any impact to your current quarter from component shortages and how much of your outlook is impacted by component shortages. Can you provide some quantification? And I have a follow up.\nGreg Brown: Yes, Fahad. Yes, there was an impact and a constraint on Q1's results from a supply chain standpoint. It's a very small number of suppliers currently. It's primarily LMR. As I mentioned earlier. And while the environment is for the most part unchanged. It has incrementally improved in working with these suppliers to get some additional units for Q1, although we had demand that was stronger than what we could supply in Q1 and we have the supply chain team here is also made some good improvements for Q2 as well.\nFahad Najam: How about the outlook? Is the outlook -- how much of your guide is baking in some headwinds from component shortages?\nGreg Brown: Definitely. Our full year eight to nine guide absolutely incorporates the current supply constraints. Without them, it would be higher, but again I think we'd have a stronger second half in an unconstrained environment, but we're working through it. We made improvements in Q1. We are making improvements in Q2, which in part informs the 19% to 20% strength of guide and there is work for us to do in Q3 and Q4 and we'll update you again in August.\nFahad Najam: Okay. My other question I wanted to dive into the fixed video opportunity outside of the United States. Your two largest Chinese these competitors Hikvision and Dahua have been pretty much implicated in running concentration camps in China. To what extent are you beginning to now see meaningful wins in Hikvision and Dahua footprint. And can you provide some quantification. I appreciate that video is growing overall, but how much of it is coming from share gain against these two large suppliers?\nGreg Brown: Well, you're right, and I know you asked an international question, but in the National Defense Authorization Act, both those companies are named by name about not having any fixed video deployments and government agencies are and certainly also not being eligible for any federal grant money. It's also Fahad important to remind everybody. We are clear-eyed about the opportunity in the addressable market here which we characterize is about 15 billion or 16 billion and that's zeroing out China, zero. We expect zero fixed video sales in China. I know that Hikvision and Dahua will continue to be the indigenous providers in country. But I think with the NDAA-compliance and the concern around those two vendors in critical security implementations that clearly has a favorable impact as well in other parts of Europe and Western democracies. So I think it's a tailwind.\nJason Winkler: It is. Greg I think you said it well and I would just say within Europe I think there is a great deal of skepticism. Around Hikvision and Dahua right now I would say that also travels into the Middle East and into Australia, we've got significant opportunities and to answer your question directly, we've displaced Dahua and Hikvision on gaming opportunities in the Middle East. IndigoVision, we acquired IndigoVision, if you remember last year, they were the inverse of what we did in Pelco as well where they have better international footprint. We've brought that footprint into our fixed video business and we've been really, really pleased with work they've done to get us in the Middle East, certain parts of Europe, but we had some softness with Avigilon. So again I think international is a market that's going to ramp well for us.\nFahad Najam: I appreciate the answers. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Fahad.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.\nBen Bollin: Thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to hit back an earlier question. Specifically, when you look at ARPA, could you talk a little bit about how that stimulus money, how do you think it might influence customers willingness to adopt newer technologies such as surveillance or command center. And then how does stimulus money specifically influence the sales cycle, which I think historically or a bit longer in public sector, does it shrink that sales cycle, any impacts there and then I have a follow-up?\nJack Molloy: Yes, Ben, so let's start with this. We have a selling process that looks at every technology we make, every government agency or every enterprise decision makers that we have, and we do it really a three-dimensional view in any account. We are continually talking about not only our core technologies, but our emerging technologies with those customers. So in the mind of a customer, you first of all have to identify a need. The second thing is really how do you fund it. So you asked a question. What is the ARP plan done? It's alleviated a lot of concerns around visibility to money. And so in that sense in some ways it's never easy to make a sale, but in a lot of ways it clears up one of the biggest obstacles to sale, the great news is albeit that there is some of the deadlines on this funding, go all the way out to 2024. The reality is that there is no reason, there is no prohibition to spend that money earlier. So our sales team obviously has had many, many years at this with funding and we can provide different incentives et cetera to get customers to move faster if that may be the case, but just knowing they have visibility to that money I think provides a very good environment for us.\nBen Bollin: Awesome. Thanks, Jack. Greg, one for you. Lots of encouraging things backlog, stimulus, the recovery as a whole. I got some region a little bit, but any perspective on the former $9 billion in revenue at $10 in EPS framework that you talked about?\nGreg Brown: No. No perspective on that yet, Ben, but again you know how we printed Q1 and I referenced a whole litany of different records we've had and that's fine, right, but I don't really care about that in terms of what needs to be done today and tomorrow. It's important in that its foundational and its momentum and this is some of the strongest momentum I've seen in a long time. We have to deliver, we got to execute, we have to navigate supply challenges. There is always a lot to do, but I'm really proud of everybody here on the team. Everybody knows their role. There is no confusion about what we're trying to do and between the deployment of capital organically and inorganically and there remains some interesting inorganic opportunities. It's all about driving sustained shareholder value creation. And I don't mean to sound corny, but I think generally we've been good stewards of capital. We have the expansion to the share repurchase program although that doesn't -- that's we did that because the previous program was running out, but the capital allocation framework that we think about 50% for acquisitions and share repurchase and 30% for dividend and 20% for CapEx in a normalized balance sheet continues. So stay tuned for the opportunities in front, but we're looking to, and by the way, it's not just about 2021. I want to make sure that we continue this momentum in 2022 and beyond. So lots more work to do, but I like the cards we have.\nBen Bollin: Thanks for the perspective.\nGreg Brown: Yes. Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nSami Badri: Hi, thank you. Unfortunately, I'm going to go back to the supply shortage and component shortage conversation and maybe I was hoping, could you give us an idea on the number of suppliers who are working with that are actually supply constrained and have they given you guys essentially a counts and weeks in terms of what lead times you are looking at. Are they 30, 40 or they 50 weeks across some of the most important components for radios some of other products you guys have?\nGreg Brown: So it's a handful of, first of all, the category is semiconductor. As a general category I'm sure that's not a surprise to you, Sami. It's about three or four vendors really that we're working with. We are doing detailed planning with them by week and by months. We regularly weekly go through the allocation necessary for us to meet demand as we balance what to fulfill and what not to. Again it's primarily LMR and I'm engaged with all of those vendors and I have to say they're responding pretty well. I don't want to get over our skis, but they were pretty good in Q1, helping us pull forward some incremental units, and they've been helpful, particularly one supplier that comes to mind. I won't name, but they've been great and the CEO has been an excellent partner and he has been accessible and I call him on his cell phone and he calls me and we talk regularly. He has been excellent and his team is really good and they're helping us through Q2 as well. And we know what work needs to be done in the back half, but at the end of the day, we just want to be prudent about the full year guide and while there is so many strong signals. We'll go a quarter as we go and we'll update you again in August.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you. And then one question for Kelly and this is a little bit tied to the America's Rescue Plan. Now, when you're working with the first responders, now they're looking to deploy or finally integrates sophisticated command center offerings with the modules and more of an end-to-end solution. Does the America's rescue plan allow these customers to go bigger and wider and it's more expensive on the number of modules and solutions they're deploying in their own organizations?\nKelly Mark: The general answer on that is, yes. It is allocated there. They'll have to apply for it. The one area in particular that will get touched on that is the NGCS component, which is the fundamental 911 database backbone, which as you know is a new and growing area of our business that we are participating in now. So you're going to see a lot of applications for the NGCS component to start building on enhanced 911 call centers, which we think then will also drive additional churn of the 911 software base around that have enhanced software to really harvest the multimedia that will come through the NGCS stuff.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Sami.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment. Your line is now open.\nJim Suva: Thank you. And first I want to say you and your team for having a great strategy and executing on the operations during such a very difficult time the past year, year and a half. As we look forward with the government stimulus on the customer who about to come in and enter into the market and as you mentioned it's multi-year, it seems like it's going to impact many parts of your business, which parts are kind of going to be the most material and kind of timing of those. Is it more like stationary cameras first and then software second, but it seems like the software, the cameras won't really work without all the software, and it seems like it kind of all touches each other. So I'm just trying, I'm wondering about where you see the biggest opportunity from these government programs as they start to come out in the next few years?\nGreg Brown: So if you think about the three technology groups that we report is a subline item. I first of all say given that it's not only state and local funding, but there's educational funding and airports and transits. I would dimensionalize fixed video is likely the biggest beneficiary of the American Rescue Plan. Follow quickly by command center software and then LMR upgrades as well as services, it will be addressed and attached to namely the state and local budget line. So, Jim, those will be the primary beneficiaries. And I would say there are 1A with the secondary groups is being 1B command center software and LMR and services.\nJim Suva: Great. Thanks so much and again congratulations to you and everyone at your company.\nGreg Brown: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations for any additional or closing remarks.\nTim Yocum: Thanks everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's teleconference.

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Our Q1 results included revenue of 1.8 billion, up 7% including $48 million from acquisitions and $32 million from favorable currency. GAAP operating earnings of $298 million and operating margins of 16.8% of sales compared to 15.6% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $411 million up $64 million or 18% and non-GAAP operating margins of 23.5% of sales, up from 21% driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 compared to $1.12 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved operating leverage, and lower legal fees partially offset by the gain from the sale of a manufacturing facility recognized in the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.87 compared to $1.49 last year primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments. Higher pension income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. OpEx in Q1 was $455 million up $4 million versus last year, primarily due to costs related to acquisitions, partially offset by lower discretionary spend. Turning to cash flow. Our Q1 operating cash flow was $370 million compared with $308 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $318 million compared with $260 million in the prior year. The increasing cash flow was primarily due to higher sales and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for Q1 included 170 million of share repurchases at an average price of $175.53 million, $121 million in cash dividends and $52 million of CapEx. During the quarter, we entered into a new five-year $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, replacing our prior $2.2 billion facility and subsequent to quarter-end the Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program. Moving to our segment results. Q1 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1 billion, up 2% primarily driven by growth in video security and professional and commercial radio partially offset by lower sales of public safety LMR, which were impacted by supply constraints. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $35 million. Operating earnings were $131 million or 12.9% of sales up from 12.4% in the year prior on higher sales and improved leverage. Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment, include a $300 million frame agreement with the German MOD to meet their TETRA LMR requirements with an initial order of $154 million recorded in Q1. $72 million of video sales with government customers up 32% from last year, a $37 million P25 upgrade for government agency in Canada, a $33 million TETRA upgrade for large customer in Europe and a $12 million P25 order with the large US Federal customer. Moving to the Software and Services segment. Q1 revenue was $758 million, up 15% from last year driven by growth in LMR services, video security, and command center software. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $13 million. Operating earnings were $280 million or 36.9% of sales, up 310 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales, higher gross margins and improved leverage. Some notable Q1 wins in the segment, include $40 million of orders for P25 services, upgrades and body-worn cameras with Nashville, Tennessee. A $35 million Push-to-Talk over broadband multi-year contract with a large US customer. A $22 million P25 and Push-to-Talk over broadband contract from a large Middle Eastern customer. $13 million of body-worn cameras with multiple UK customers and our largest cloud-based command center software win to-date. A $5 million contract with St. Lucie Florida. Additionally, we announced a new product integration between our V3100 body-worn camera and our APX P25 radio platform. Looking at our regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 6% and growth in LMR, video security, and command center software. International Q1 revenue of $588 million was up 9% with growth in EMEA, Asia Pac, and Latin America. The growth was driven by video security and LMR. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $11.3 billion, up $866 million compared to last year driven by $639 million of growth in North America and $227 million of growth internationally. Sequentially backlog was down $130 million driven by revenue recognition on the Airwave and ESN contracts partially offset with international growth in LMR products. Software and Services backlog was up $548 million compared to last year, driven by $491 million of growth in multi-year LMR services and command center software contracts in North America and $58 million of international software growth. The favorable impact of FX to backlog was offset by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Sequentially backlog was down $269 million also driven by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Products and SI backlog was $318 million compared up $318 million compared to last year primarily driven by LMR growth in both regions. Sequentially, backlog was up $139 million driven by international LMR growth. Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up between 19% and 20% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.90 per share and $1.95 per share. This assumes FX at current spot rates, weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. And for the full year we now expect sales to be up between 8% and 9%, an increase from our prior guide of 7.25% to 8% and we expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $8.70 per share and $8.80 per share up from our prior guidance of $8.50 per share to $8.62 per share. This increased outlook includes the ongoing supply chain constraints primarily in LMR products and assumes FX at current spot rates, a weighted average diluted share count of 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22.5% to 23%. I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg. One thing I'd add on the input costs. We're not seeing measurable increases on inputs. The one area where we've had to navigate is higher freight costs and moving things to the ocean off of what had been freight, air freight, which are very high. So that's leading to slightly higher inventory for the time being, but we'll navigate through those but as Greg said more opportunities there. Yes. So for fixed video, the growth drivers really fundamentally been through the first part of this year is North America. We talked about North America, go-to-market coverage, that's paid big dividends. I would also tell you internationally every theater grew. We've done a really nice job in growing international key accounts, that's also a growth driver, and we start to think about from a technology standpoint, it's really been driven by a strength in analytics refresh, camera refreshes and I'd have to hit it again, but the government vertical as well as education continue to be a benefit not only Avigilon, but also the Pelco acquisition, which have helped us in the federal government's leave as well. The other encouraging sign is that we saw a good product launch in Ion and a good reception from that very important part of the portfolio that was released recently and seeing good take rates. It is. Greg I think you said it well and I would just say within Europe I think there is a great deal of skepticism. Around Hikvision and Dahua right now I would say that also travels into the Middle East and into Australia, we've got significant opportunities and to answer your question directly, we've displaced Dahua and Hikvision on gaming opportunities in the Middle East. IndigoVision, we acquired IndigoVision, if you remember last year, they were the inverse of what we did in Pelco as well where they have better international footprint. We've brought that footprint into our fixed video business and we've been really, really pleased with work they've done to get us in the Middle East, certain parts of Europe, but we had some softness with Avigilon. So again I think international is a market that's going to ramp well for us."

            "content": "Adam, it's Kelly. The answer is yes. We're still tracking to the 20%. We're pleased with the growth we got, the 30% in Q1, but as we come into the back half of the year, the growth rates associated with Q2 through Q4 will benefit from the softer comps of what we saw in 2020 on COVID impact and not to mention the other thing is we have some very large NGCS deals, which we won last year that will start contributing revenue in the back half of the year. So going to the approximately 20% is something that we are still targeting. The general answer on that is, yes. It is allocated there. They'll have to apply for it. The one area in particular that will get touched on that is the NGCS component, which is the fundamental 911 database backbone, which as you know is a new and growing area of our business that we are participating in now.

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook. First, Q1 was an excellent quarter. We achieved Q1 records for sales, operating earnings, and cash flow. We expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with backlog of $11.3 billion up 8% versus last year. Additionally demand remains strong resulting in orders that were higher than any other first quarter in our history. Second, our Software and Services segment had another outstanding quarter and continues to drive revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Sales for the quarter were up 15% driven by growth across our LMR, video security, and command center software technologies and this segment also finished with operating margins up 310 basis points versus last year. And finally, based on the increased demand we're seeing across our business and our strong backlog position, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share for the full year. I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Jason, thanks, and now I'd like to end with a few thoughts on the business. First, our results for the quarter were outstanding. We achieved Q1 record sales, orders, operating earnings, and cash flow expanded both gross and operating margins, achieved double-digit growth in video security, command center software and LMR services and our PCR business returned to growth. Additionally, we exited the quarter with a record Q1 backlog and continued strong demand that we expect will drive growth for the remainder of the year inclusive of the supply challenges that we have. We also announced today that the Board approved a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase program. The second thing I would say is demand in our video security business is really strong and we now expect full year growth to be 20% plus up from the high teens we referenced on our last call. In fixed video, which makes up approximately 70% of the total video security revenue. Our investments in AI analytics, cloud services, access control and NDAA-compliant manufacturing is differentiating us from our competitors and driving growth faster than the overall market. And in mobile video, the call for more transparency is driving growth for our purpose-built body-worn and in-car camera solutions and we're gaining share in a market that has predominantly been served by one vendor. During the quarter, we had several large body-worn camera wins both in the US and internationally. Just this morning, we announced a $17.5 million contract to provide about 30,000 body-worn cameras to the French Ministry of Interior. Additionally, during the quarter, we announced two new offerings. The integration of our V3100 body-worn camera with our APX P25 radios, which allow us to leverage our market leading LMR installed base and our $49 per month body-worn camera as a service offering, which offers every police agency in the US with affordable access to a video solution that's fully integrated with our command central software suite. And finally, I'm very pleased with our progress in leveraging our leading installed base in LMR to expand in the command center software, video security, and LMR services. Today, almost half our revenue is generated from these higher-growth areas up from 20% five years ago and our addressable market has tripled over that same period of time. And while we've made significant progress, I absolutely believe we still have a long runway ahead as we continue to deploy capital both organically and inorganically in these areas to drive revenue, margin, and cash flow for the company. And, with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim and look forward to your questions. Thanks, Tim. I'm pleased with the video security business in total. Both fixed video and mobile. I think Molloy and Kedzierski and the entire team has done a great job on investing in additional go-to-market, refreshing the product portfolio both in fixed video, body-worn camera, and mobile video. As I mentioned, also I think the secret sauce for us is to not just have great products in video, but also the integration and orchestration of that with the installed base that we have with thousands of LMR and PCR networks around the world. I'm thrilled with the progress in body-worn camera, both domestically and internationally. We had the big announcement this morning with the French Ministry of Interior. But we're taking share. We're clearly I think we've been doing that since late last year, the second half of 2020, and it's pretty clear as well that we're taking share and we took share in Q1 and Jack may want to talk about the progress in public safety as well which I'm pleased with. And, Tim, just on software, which is your last part of your question on what -- how that plays into it. This past quarter, you may have seen we announced our CC command central evidence platform, which is our new Azure-based cloud platform, which works seamlessly with all of our body-worn video to help manage the body-worn video and in-car video that comes in and that's important because it doesn't just work with our body-worn video, it also works seamlessly with the whole command center software suite that we have, evidence being managing the body-worn video, but it integrates seamlessly with the entirety of our records platform as well. So they all play together and work well together and we're making the investments across the board as Jack referenced on body-worn and of course also on the software that handles at the back end. Thank you, Tim. No, Adam, look I think the environment is very healthy and the demand is very strong. I think that's indicated by the record Q1 that I outlined in a number of categories and the robustness and the strength of the backlog that we're exiting Q1 as well. Now having said that, right, if you look at first half, second half growth, obviously first half growth for us this year is very high. It's a bit distorted for us and other companies, given the Q2 pronounced COVID effect, but nonetheless, I'm very happy with what we did in Q1. I'm pleased with how we're guiding Q2 and I remind you, Adam, also 90 million of FX favorability is in the first half. It's more like 38 million to 40 million in the second half, but also as it relates to supply, we're still operating under the current environment, which is generally comparable to what it was when we talk to you a quarter ago. Although, I would point out, while it remains challenging, the team did a nice job working with some key suppliers pulling forward key components to execute and print Q1. They're also doing it again, which is informing and driving a very healthy guide in Q2. So while the supply environment remains challenging, we will look to continue on those improvements in the back half, but at this point in time, and given the fact that the pandemic is still there, which I thought it was a prudent guide. Yes, Meta. So as we look kind of at the full year and from a margin perspective for the company, from a gross margin standpoint. I think they will be comparable maybe slightly up and that includes probably the gross margin profile for the segments as well products as well as software and services. If you take operating margins, we're now anticipating operating margin expansion in software and services to be up about 140 basis points. That's an increase from what we've talked about a quarter ago by 40 basis points and we expect product segment operating margins to grow as well more commensurate with volume. In terms of the demand environment, I think, it's partially pent-up demand. I think things are reopening as the pandemic depending upon the geography relieves itself and the economy starts to get back into a strong rhythm of expansion. From a stimulus standpoint, there is a lot of money available to our customers, particularly on the public safety side both around the CARES Act, which was already in place for 2020 and continues on through 2021 as well as the American Rescue Plan, which is new available money in the Biden $1.9 trillion Plan. There is $350 billion for state and local funding. There is a $170 billion for school funding. There is $38 billion for airports and transit. There is a lot of money. The other important thing is that these funds are available for about the next 3 years to 3.5 years. So our customers will have available grant money, the environments remaining strong and gets stronger in public safety. The PCR business on the enterprise side grew at 8% in Q1 and we are reaffirming its growth all in for this year. So I like the position we're in and I like the signals we're seeing. Thank you. And, Louie, the other key around that is in addition to what Jack said, think automation, think analytics, think integration. So as the Motorola Solutions Critical Infrastructure on fixed video, mobile video, land mobile radio, perimeter detection, backpack, delinquent student, inappropriate trucking on a parking lot. All of that would be automated. As Jack said not only sends an alert to the radio, but also can automatically alert in command central aware, a 911 dispatch operator as well. So we're leveraging the installed base capitalizing on the new fixed video architecture targeting safe schools and integrating and automating all of the technology we have to differentiate in an offering that we don't think anyone else can provide. Exactly. Yes, and our CTO Mahesh who came with us to -- from us to the -- from the acquisition of Avigilon to Motorola has been critical in the orchestration software work and integration work to make all these technologies seamlessly work together. Right. And with Evolve that gives us another investment around access control. We were in investor earlier probably a year or two ago with Evolve. We're committed to make a future investments. It's a little bit more consequential. And so when you think about critical infrastructure locations like schools or stadiums or airports or hospitals Evolve and that partnership around weapons detection is another interesting component to integrate into the suite as we develop our product portfolio and think about a differentiated operating going forward. We are confirming it for the full year, Paul. I mentioned that it grew 8% in Q1. We didn't give a specific number, but it wouldn't surprise me if the full year growth is generally commensurate with that kind of number, but I like the signals that are coming back from that business. Well, critical mass, Paul is certainly a benefit as we get greater density and it's kind of a nucleus for a flywheel of growth. We did raise our outlook today on the video security technologies all into 20% plus growth for fiscal 2021 up from high teens. I wouldn't necessarily extrapolate into 2022 necessarily. It's a little too early for that, but the markers are good. The momentum is good. The product portfolio is getting refreshed and the investments that are being made and we're taking share. We're taking share both in the fixed video component. We're taking share in the body-worn camera component. And I also believe that access control and the integration of access control with video security is also a nice opportunity for us as it relates to the individual enterprise verticals that are recovering from PCR perspective maybe Jack can provide a little bit on that front. And just thread the two points on growth. Last year's video business for us in total was $926 million, that's the business that we're talking about growing at 20% plus in this year of '21. Jack's comments earlier were about the 300 million of that, that's anticipated this year to be from specifically government, and that's a part of the business that was very nascent just three or four years ago and was part of our thesis in penetrating the Avigilon portfolio into our legacy accounts and we're doing that. Thanks, Paul. Well, I would just say this, it is probably too early to predict on that front, but through Q1 and actually quarter-to-date from an orders and bookings standpoint, the trend is very good. Now I'm not going to declare an endpoint of when we return to that level, but I would simply say it's certainly ahead of the expectations that we had a quarter ago when we had the full-year view. And I'd also say, even though we're operating in a supply constrained environment, our channel partners have done a good job, managing this and handling and balancing the inventory levels that they hold to satisfy their customers, but the signals are strong, certainly stronger, I thought they would be good for PCR as you heard me say I thought PCR would return to growth in 2021. We're off to a very good start, orders are strong, and they're probably ahead of my expectations of where we are as we sit here in May, but we'll update you again in August, but it's very good. Thank you. Yes, we have. It's a really good question. We've seen the team -- kind of a -- in a joking way, but you give salespeople and pass the money good salespeople and they go find it and we've had discussions already public safety engagements right away for the state and local funding we've been engaged with schools, but also airports and transits when they've had a little bit of downtime, they're doing some planning as well. Now that they know they've got funding available. I would say the sales cycle here as we sit in 2021, I would caveat it, in North America, it's largely return to normal, both in terms of government and in terms of our PCR business, which is focused in the enterprise. Europe has been very slow. Borders are still slow down. A lot of it's virtual. Parts of Asia return back to normal and COVID is running through Latin American and things and engagements very slow there, but in North America things have returned very much close to normal. Thanks, Trevor. Yes, Fahad. Yes, there was an impact and a constraint on Q1's results from a supply chain standpoint. It's a very small number of suppliers currently. It's primarily LMR. As I mentioned earlier. And while the environment is for the most part unchanged. It has incrementally improved in working with these suppliers to get some additional units for Q1, although we had demand that was stronger than what we could supply in Q1 and we have the supply chain team here is also made some good improvements for Q2 as well. Definitely. Our full year eight to nine guide absolutely incorporates the current supply constraints. Without them, it would be higher, but again I think we'd have a stronger second half in an unconstrained environment, but we're working through it. We made improvements in Q1. We are making improvements in Q2, which in part informs the 19% to 20% strength of guide and there is work for us to do in Q3 and Q4 and we'll update you again in August. Well, you're right, and I know you asked an international question, but in the National Defense Authorization Act, both those companies are named by name about not having any fixed video deployments and government agencies are and certainly also not being eligible for any federal grant money. It's also Fahad important to remind everybody. We are clear-eyed about the opportunity in the addressable market here which we characterize is about 15 billion or 16 billion and that's zeroing out China, zero. We expect zero fixed video sales in China. I know that Hikvision and Dahua will continue to be the indigenous providers in country. But I think with the NDAA-compliance and the concern around those two vendors in critical security implementations that clearly has a favorable impact as well in other parts of Europe and Western democracies. So I think it's a tailwind. Thanks, Fahad. No. No perspective on that yet, Ben, but again you know how we printed Q1 and I referenced a whole litany of different records we've had and that's fine, right, but I don't really care about that in terms of what needs to be done today and tomorrow. It's important in that its foundational and its momentum and this is some of the strongest momentum I've seen in a long time. We have to deliver, we got to execute, we have to navigate supply challenges. There is always a lot to do, but I'm really proud of everybody here on the team. Everybody knows their role. There is no confusion about what we're trying to do and between the deployment of capital organically and inorganically and there remains some interesting inorganic opportunities. It's all about driving sustained shareholder value creation. And I don't mean to sound corny, but I think generally we've been good stewards of capital. We have the expansion to the share repurchase program although that doesn't -- that's we did that because the previous program was running out, but the capital allocation framework that we think about 50% for acquisitions and share repurchase and 30% for dividend and 20% for CapEx in a normalized balance sheet continues. So stay tuned for the opportunities in front, but we're looking to, and by the way, it's not just about 2021. I want to make sure that we continue this momentum in 2022 and beyond. So lots more work to do, but I like the cards we have. Yes. Thank you, Ben. So it's a handful of, first of all, the category is semiconductor. As a general category I'm sure that's not a surprise to you, Sami. It's about three or four vendors really that we're working with. We are doing detailed planning with them by week and by months. We regularly weekly go through the allocation necessary for us to meet demand as we balance what to fulfill and what not to. Again it's primarily LMR and I'm engaged with all of those vendors and I have to say they're responding pretty well. I don't want to get over our skis, but they were pretty good in Q1, helping us pull forward some incremental units, and they've been helpful, particularly one supplier that comes to mind. I won't name, but they've been great and the CEO has been an excellent partner and he has been accessible and I call him on his cell phone and he calls me and we talk regularly. He has been excellent and his team is really good and they're helping us through Q2 as well. And we know what work needs to be done in the back half, but at the end of the day, we just want to be prudent about the full year guide and while there is so many strong signals. We'll go a quarter as we go and we'll update you again in August. Thanks, Sami. So if you think about the three technology groups that we report is a subline item. I first of all say given that it's not only state and local funding, but there's educational funding and airports and transits. I would dimensionalize fixed video is likely the biggest beneficiary of the American Rescue Plan. Follow quickly by command center software and then LMR upgrades as well as services, it will be addressed and attached to namely the state and local budget line. So, Jim, those will be the primary beneficiaries. And I would say there are 1A with the secondary groups is being 1B command center software and LMR and services. Thank you, Jim."

            "name": "Jack Molloy",
            "content": "Sure. Yes. Just maybe one point to follow on top of Greg's. First of all, as it relates to body-worn. If you look at the data that was just released by our competitor Exxon and ourselves. They grew their shipment 16% in Q1 that 7,000 units in an absolute perspective whereby we grew body-worn shipments a 104%, which is 11,500 units. So I think that's indicative of the share we've taken. The second thing, Tim, I think you talked about in general our video business into government and if you remember that was a largely nascent business for us just a few years ago, will eclipse $300 million to start there, and I think that really plays on as Greg said both strength in fixed and mobile. And I think we stand at the intersection of two really important things, transparency and government efficiency. The last thing I'd close with is the American Rescue Plan puts us in play for multi-year tailwinds as it relates to incremental public safety spend, spend around education, we're fixing schools with both video security and access control as well. So, I feel good as Greg said just to reiterate a few of those points and add a little deeper, but feel good all-in on government. Sure. Louie, hi, it's Jack. The education vertical, it's interesting, because Greg just talked about the American Rescue Plan. There is $170 billion directed to school funding that runs through September 23. So we've really got a duality of opportunities with education. The biggest opportunity we have with education is in our fixed video, security, and access control business. Simply put, it's been one of our highest growing verticals in that business. We not only have a regional sales team, but we have a group of business development vertical specialists that focus and work out with schools on directing funding in those kind of things. So we're really pleased there, but we also work and do -- we have a safety reimagine campaign going on that actually pulls together fixed video security and PCR and that message resonates very well. So think about you get an intrusion on a door access control, sends a signal to a PCR radio whereby every teacher might have one and the level of security that enhances that schools has been impressive. And I think resonates with our customers. So we're really excited actually in my career here this is probably the best opportunity set we've had in education. Yes. So internationally those markets have still been slow to rebound. We have seen, I would say, very measured and slight improvements in oil and gas earlier this year really even in Q4 last year, we started to see some recovery. Hospitality in general is still slow. I would say in the Southeast and through the Southwest, it's a little better, but it's still been slow, we think those things will improve in Q2 into Q3. And the only other thing, Jason, I'd piggyback on that is also we've talked about our distance learning. We talked about monies that have been available for broadband investments and schools are investing in distance learning. We've talked about four big school districts last year. We've replicated that in Q1 and there continue to be a drumbeat of interest and a lot of those upgrades happen during the summer months. So we're actually very excited about our private LTE, Nitro solution as well. Yes, Ben, so let's start with this. We have a selling process that looks at every technology we make, every government agency or every enterprise decision makers that we have, and we do it really a three-dimensional view in any account. We are continually talking about not only our core technologies, but our emerging technologies with those customers. So in the mind of a customer, you first of all have to identify a need. The second thing is really how do you fund it. So you asked a question. What is the ARP plan done? It's alleviated a lot of concerns around visibility to money. And so in that sense in some ways it's never easy to make a sale, but in a lot of ways it clears up one of the biggest obstacles to sale, the great news is albeit that there is some of the deadlines on this funding, go all the way out to 2024. The reality is that there is no reason, there is no prohibition to spend that money earlier. So our sales team obviously has had many, many years at this with funding and we can provide different incentives et cetera to get customers to move faster if that may be the case, but just knowing they have visibility to that money I think provides a very good environment for us."

A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, or any quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. I'll now turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and the outlook. First, our record Q4 results highlight the continued robust demand we're seeing for our public safety and enterprise security solutions. During the quarter we grew revenue 17%, earnings per share of 26%, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points, and generated a record $1.3 billion of operating cash flow. Additionally, orders remained strong, which led to record ending backlog of $14.3 billion, up $800 million versus last year. Second, 2022 was an outstanding year across the board. In our Products and Systems Integration segment, we grew revenue 14% driven by strong growth in both LMR and video security and we ended the year with record backlog, up 22% versus last year. We also expanded operating margins in the segment by 110 basis points despite higher costs related to semiconductors. In Software and Services, revenue was up 8% and 12% when normalized for FX headwinds, highlighted by double-digit growth in both video security and Command Center. And finally, as I look to 2023 [Technical Difficulty] positions us well for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth. I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 17% with record fourth quarter revenue in both segments and in all three technologies. Revenue exceeded our guidance and was driven by supply chain execution during the quarter, enabling higher product revenues in LMR. FX headwinds during the quarter were $87 million, while acquisitions added $39 million. GAAP operating earnings were $692 million, up 26% versus last year and GAAP operating margins were 25.6% compared with 23.7% in the prior year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $822 million [Technical Difficulty] GAAP operating margin was 30.4%, up from 28.9%. This was Motorola Solutions' first ever quarter of over 30% operating margin and was driven by the higher sales in both segments and the improved operating leverage, particularly in the Products and SI segment. GAAP earnings per share was $3.43, up from $2.30 in the year-ago quarter on higher sales and on a lower effective tax rate driven primarily by a $47 million or $0.27 per share tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance against U.S. foreign tax credits. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.60, up 26% from $2.85 last year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. OpEx in Q4 was $541 million, up $21 million versus last year, primarily due to acquisitions and higher incentives. For the full-year 2022, revenue was $9.1 billion, up 12% with strong growth in both segments and across all three technologies. The impact from unfavorable currency was $216 million and revenue from acquisitions was $121 million. GAAP operating earnings were $1.7 billion or 18.2% of sales versus 20.4% in the year prior. The decrease was primarily driven by the $147 million non-cash fixed asset impairment recognized in the current year related to our exit of ESN. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.4 billion, up $251 million and non-GAAP operating margins were 26% of sales, up from 25.9% in the year prior, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs, and higher expenses from acquisitions. GAAP earnings per share was $7.93, up 11% compared to the $7.17 in the year prior, driven by higher sales, a lower effective tax rate and partially offset by the asset impairment charge related to the ESN exit and higher material costs. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $10.36, up 13% from $9.15 in 2021 on higher sales, improved -- and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs. For the full year, our operating expenses were $2.1 billion, up $107 million from 2021, primarily driven by acquisitions and investments into our video business. And the effective tax rate for 2022 was 20% compared to 21% in the year prior, due to higher benefits from stock based compensation in the current year. Turning next to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was a record $1.3 billion, up $570 million compared with the prior year, and free-cash-flow was $1.2 billion, up $565 million from 2021. Our record cash-flow performance during the quarter was driven by improved working capital and higher earnings. And for the full year, operating cash flow was $1.8 billion with free cash flow of $1.6 billion, consistent with the prior year. Higher earnings in 2022 were offset by the cash payments related to the increase in annual incentive payments earned in 2021 and higher inventory. Capital allocation for 2022 included $1.2 billion for acquisitions, $836 million in share repurchases at an average price of $225 per share, and $530 million in cash dividends. Additionally, during the year we issued $600 million of new long-term debt and repaid $275 million of outstanding debt. We also increased our dividend to 11%, our 12th consecutive year of double-digit increases. Moving next to our segment results. In Products and SI, strong demand continued with Q4 sales up 21%, including record revenue in both LMR and video. The currency headwinds were $43 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $20 million. Operating earnings in Q4 were $514 million or 28.4% of sales, up from 25.3% in the year prior, driven primarily by higher sales and operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs. Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include several large APX NEXT device orders, including $45 million from the City of Houston, $39 million from a large U.S. customer, $30 million from the City of Dallas, and a $21 million add-on order from a large U.S. customer that previously purchased APX NEXT devices. Additionally, during the quarter, we received a $20 million APX NEXT and Command Center order from Kansas City, a $19 million P25 System order for a large international customer, and a $3 million fixed order for metro rail in Chicago. For the full year, Products and SI revenue was $5.7 billion, up 14% from the prior year, driven by higher sales of LMR and Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $53 million and currency headwinds were $98 million. Full-year operating earnings were $1.2 billion or 20.5% of sales, up from 19.4% in the year prior on higher sales and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs. In Software and Services, Q4 revenue was 9% -- up 9%, which included $44 million of FX headwinds, and $19 million of revenue from acquisitions. Total software revenue was up 17% with double-digit growth in both video and Command Center, while in LMR Services revenue was up 5% after a $39 million FX headwind. Q4 operating earnings in the segment were $308 million or 34.4% of sales, down 100 basis points from last year, driven by unfavorable mix and higher acquisition expenses. Some notable Q4 highlights in this segment include a $56 million P25 multi-year extension of the managed services operations at Interexport which serves the Chilean National Law Enforcement Police; a $25 million P25 software upgrade renewal for a large U.S. customer; $22 million next generation 911 expansion, and renewal order for the Greater Harris County, Texas area; $21 million system upgrade in multiyear services renewal for Lane County Oregon; a $15 million P25 and command center upgrade order for Columbus, Georgia; and a $15 million license plate recognition camera system expansion order from the Illinois State Police. For the full year, revenue was $3.4 billion, up 8% on growth in video LMR services and command center. Revenue from acquisitions was $68 million and currency headwinds were $118 million. Full-year operating earnings were $1.2 billion or 35.3% of sales, down 110 basis points versus the prior year, driven by mix and higher acquisition expenses. Looking at our regional results. North America in Q4 revenue was $1.9 billion, up 18% on strong growth in both segments and in all three technologies. For the full year, North America revenue was $6.4 billion, up 15% with double-digit growth in both segments and in all three technologies. International Q4 revenue was $808 million, up 15% versus last year with growth in all three technologies. And for the full-year, International revenue was $2.7 billion, up 5% inclusive of the significant FX headwinds. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a record $14.3 billion, up $788 million or 6% compared to last year, inclusive of $418 million of unfavorable FX and a $99 million reduction related to the exit of the ESN contract. The backlog growth was driven by the continued record demand we're seeing across all three technologies. Sequentially, backlog was up $837 million, despite the record Q4 sales with growth in both segments. In the Products and SI segment, robust order demand in both LMR and video continues to drive record backlog, which was up $894 million or 22% compared to last year. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $68 million. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth in this segment. In Software and Services, backlog was down $106 million compared to last year, which included $367 million of unfavorable FX, driven by Airwave and ESN revenue recognition and the ESN exit, partially offset by strong growth in North America multi-year services, and software contracts. Sequentially, Software and Services backlog was up $769 million or 9% driven by strong orders in North America and favorable FX adjustment from the prior quarter. Turning now to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up between 12% and 13%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.02 and $2.07 per share. This assumes $40 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately $172 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. For the full year, we expect sales between $9.65 billion and $9.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.10 and $11.22 per share. This assumes $40 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately $172 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. We expect full-year OpEx to be up approximately $150 million versus last year, driven by acquisitions we've made, and our continued investments in video. And we expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion. And finally, the reason our effective tax rate is expected to be up 300 basis points to 400 basis points over last year is due to lower excess tax benefits on share-based compensation in 2023 and a higher U.K. tax rate that takes effect in April. We're also anticipating approximately $300 million of higher cash taxes compared to last year, inclusive of a one-time $75 million tax payment that relates to an IP reorganization we did in 2022. Before I turn the call back to Greg, I wanted to update you on some strategic decisions we've made with respect to our PCR business. First, in order to further optimize our supply chain, we have moved the lowest part of PCR, which is sold to small businesses and some consumers to a licensed model with a third-party manufacturer. As a result of this change, we will only recognize revenues equal to the margin from the product. In addition, we made a decision to exit some PCR markets in Asia. We expect these changes together to constitute an $80 million headwinds to our 2022 -- 2023 revenues, which is fully contemplated in our full-year revenue guidance for 2023. And finally, we enter the New Year with an even stronger balance sheet. We ended 2022 with $1.3 billion of cash and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2 times. In addition, our U.S. pension is in a strong funding position with over 80% funded reflecting the numerous actions we've implemented over the last several years. We have also proactively refinanced our debt maturities with fixed-rate long-term debt and established a balanced maturity profile with an average duration of approximately eight years. All of this gives us the flexibility to continue to deliver on our capital allocation framework and be opportunistic in M&A. I'll now turn the call back over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Jason. First, 2022 was a phenomenal year for the company. We achieved double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive year with record sales in both segments and all three technologies. We expanded operating margins despite the continued supply challenges related to semiconductors and we ended the year with a record $14.3 billion of backlog, up almost $800 million versus the prior year. Second, our acquisition of Rave Mobile Safety during Q4 was our seventh acquisition last year. Rave adds approximately $70 million of annual recurring revenue for 2023 and expands the company's addressable market by approximately $7 billion. Whether it's a student or a teacher alerting public safety with the push of a button or 911 call takers coordinating a more informed response, Rave Mobile Safety amplifies the connection between our video security and Command Center portfolios. Since 2015, we've invested almost $6 billion in acquiring companies that have helped us create a broad set of public safety and enterprise security solutions. These assets have helped to accelerate our revenue growth, diversify the composition of our revenue streams, and more than quadrupled our addressable market to what we now estimate to be $60 billion. And finally, as I look ahead, the momentum of our business remains strong. The funding environment for public safety and enterprise security remains exceptional. Our investments in APX NEXT device portfolio are driving a refresh cycle that is still in the very early days with less than 10% of customers' installed base upgraded to date. Our AI and Cloud solutions continue to help drive market-share gains in video security and command center software, and will continue to navigate the ongoing supply-chain challenges, I'm extremely pleased with how we're positioned as we enter this year and I expect it to be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth for the company. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim, and we'll take your questions.\nTim Yocum: Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?\nOperator: Yes, sir. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTim Long: Thank you. Greg, maybe could you just give us a little sense of the backdrop, it sounds like obviously backlog was pretty strong, but talk a little bit about kind of federal ARPA and other revenue sources? How is that starting to flow through? How are your customers taking advantage of that and what do you think that means to visibility over the next few years? And then Jason, for you on the clarification, just talk a little bit about gross margins. Maybe walk us through the next year at some point we should be getting some bounce-back from components and logistics and maybe just touch on price increases that we've seen and how that would flow through the model and hit the gross margins next year? Thank you.\nJack Molloy: So, this is Jack. I'll take the first question. I think it was regarding the federal funding, but really good news. So we had over $400 million of orders in 2022. But I think most importantly, the $350 billion that was allocated state and local is a multiyear funding phenomenon. So we look at our multiyear funnel out through 2026 at being north of $1 billion. Some of the deals that Jason cited were funded in part or in -- completely funded by ARPA dollar. So we've had good success. Our team is really -- our sales team in North America traditionally really understands funding models and I think they're working it well, and we've seen good results.\nJason Winkler: And Tim, I'll also remind you that the ARPU funding, $350 billion for state and local, $170 billion earmarked for education, but most importantly, it's multiyear funding and much of this will go into and through 2026. So, the foundation of funding and the strong environment Jack described, we capitalized in 2022 as he talked about the robustness of the funnel this year. But the best part of all is, it's multiyear dimension in nature.\nGreg Brown: And Tim, I'll take the second part of your question. So as you recall, as we navigated through 2022 and having to secure parts from brokers, that year 2022 last year, we incurred about $165 million of higher costs for semiconductors in 2022 than 2021, that was a headwind for us. We -- we're able to get access to some parts in Q4. That's in part what helped our Q4 performance. So as we plan for 2023 now, we anticipate still needing to run the play of buying broker parts, it's still remains a difficult environment, particularly for automotive-grade semiconductors, but we do believe and are planning for about a $50 million tailwind in the total amount of dollars that we will allocate and spend to secure parts as for the plans we have in 2023. So $50 million tailwind in 2023 relative to 2022's cost profile.\nJason Winkler: And Tim, from a gross margin perspective overall for MSI, we expect gross margins to be up in 2023. We also expect operating margins to be up in 2023.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nJason Winkler: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. It sort of feels like somebody forgot to tell you guys that we're in a recessionary environment. The business seems to be cranking on all cylinders here. Greg, anything you worry about in terms of a recessionary environment at all? I mean, I get it the ARPA funds are kind of backfilling maybe for any softness that you could see out over the horizon. But any thoughts about tax receipts, whether its property tax or income tax receipts ultimately slowing down a year or two from now impacting the business?\nGreg Brown: George, the answer is, no, to be candid with you. The environment is strong, the funding environment, as we talked about is exceptional, 75% of our business, as you know, as government and public safety, 25% is enterprise. We still see continued strength. This year we expect growth in all three technologies LMR to be mid-single digits, video security to be about 15%, command center to be about 20%. So -- and there was an article in the journal last weekend, the state budgets are as flush as they had been in several years. We talked already about the multiyear funding horizon for ARPA. Now, nobody is immune from a recession. We've always been diligent in managing the expense structure of the firm. The majority of the driver of higher OpEx for this company year on year and period on period is generally acquisitions. So, I think we have a great portfolio, a fantastic environment, strong demand, and we are acutely focused on continued execution, new product development, acquisition integration, and growing faster than the market versus our competitors. So, now I -- look, sometimes they worried that I'm not worried, okay? But the team is aligned and we feel really good about where we are. Appreciate the question.\nJason Winkler: Also Greg...\nGeorge Notter: And then just one quick follow-up, if I could. Any -- what kind of impact are you getting in the business, from higher pricing, just thinking about the growth rate as we look out to 2023?\nGreg Brown: So, I would say the growth that we had last year, full-year was driven by both volume and price increase. I'd weight it a little bit more toward volume last year. That composition that drives our growth rate overall for this year is also volume and price. And I would weight it slightly towards volume again this year. We've exercised surgically and responsibly certain price increases that we've talked about a number of times last year. So, I think we're well-positioned going forward.\nGeorge Notter: Thank you.\nJason Winkler: Greg, the other thing that I\u2019d offer insights into are our PCR business which in 2022 grew nicely. It's now back to 2019 levels. And a part of our backlog or unfulfilled orders for us or delays are in PCR. So we have a sizable amount of PCR backlog and demand, which we will continue to fulfill into 2023.\nGreg Brown: And it's a great point, Jason because despite the fact that we had a great PCR Q4, really strong growth for the full year to Jason's point back to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. And he referenced an $80 million PC-oriented headwind, which represents a business model change even with those -- all those ingredients into the blender, we still are expecting PCR growth for 2023.\nGeorge Notter: Okay. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to start with the question, Greg. If there was any potential updates that we could give our guardrails on the potential outcomes for Airwave at this point? We understand, obviously, you've got some tailwinds to the model from managing costs and supply chain. The potential headwind looming is what could happen with Airwave. So just want to make sure that we're netting those things out and any guardrails you can give us on where that could potentially shape out?\nGreg Brown: So what I'd say is, I'd remind you that CMA their stated intention is to make a final decision this month, maybe it's next month, but it's relatively soon. We remain unchanged in our finding and belief that with full conviction that their effort is disproportionate, it's unprecedented, it's overreaching. So our view on that is unchanged. Now recall the investigation -- the market investigation is grounded around Airwave and ESN. What I can update you on is that, we have successfully signed a contract with the UK Home Office to exit ESN. I think it was a good multi-month effort where both of us are satisfied, that will result, Adam, in us exiting ESN earlier than anticipated. We are doing a transition services agreement in 2023, but then effectively after 2023 we are out of ESN. So, I think that is an update that's worthy of sharing because a quarter ago we talked about our intention to do that, but that was before we actually codified and signed the agreement. Now having said all that, I think, look, as we guide the full-year we guide the full-year with the $80 million business model change around PCR. We guide the year both top and bottom with continued supply constraints and I think it's important to know that, because there's a lot of reports that supply chain is a lot better but for the businesses that we're in and we compete primarily with industrial providers or automotive for the semiconductors that we're contending for, it's not that changed, lead times actually are largely unchanged. So that informs our guidance as well and as we sit here, on February 9th, we think all-in, it's a prudent and balanced view of the year all things considered.\nAdam Tindle: All right. And maybe just a follow-up on Rave. Obviously, spending over $0.5 billion, I'm sure there was a lot that went into that decision. Greg, I'd love for you to maybe just talk about the expected ROI in any financial metrics. Sorry, if I missed any that you could provide related to that acquisition to justify that level of capital allocation? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Yeah, so we are very excited about the asset. And the important thing, Adam, is it's an asset that's worth more to us than anyone else. So when you think about the capital deployed against the backdrop of an addressable market that expands $7 billion and all ARR, annual recurring revenue with a run rate of $70 million that we like those attributes, their verticals. 80% of the business is profiled around state and local and education, which that too is absolutely in the sweet spot of what we do and how Molloy goes to market. So the asset we're excited about, I think it's worth and we think it's worth more to us than anyone else and we've done an extensive view of the industry as well and we're excited about what it means.\nJason Winkler: A few more things to add on this. Greg already mentioned the vertical alignment that we have here, state and local government, education, which is significant for us, healthcare and corporate buildings. All of these are key areas where Rave plays a very important part. In Rave very critically as we mentioned before, connects enterprise security with public safety in some very unique ways and augments both sides of the portfolio. Probably three areas, technology areas that I want to highlight. The first is Rave enhances individual safety with mobile apps. So think about that as the Rave prepared capability where people with special needs can actually create a profile and offer information ahead of potentially something happening so that the response can actually be more effective. The second is the panic button. The ability to push a button and get help as needed, benefiting from what profile was created previously as needed as well. Rave Alert, which is a mass notification capability to keep people informed. So think about that as everything that covers people -- people's in safety, individual safety. The second area is facility preparedness. So think about the Rave facility capability where information about a facility can better inform a public safety response, including keeping responders safe and that's a very critical capability. Rave Collaborates help set up standard operating procedures of how someone should respond for various incidents ahead of when an incident actually happens. This very uniquely enables us to coordinate the ability that we have on the video security side and the command center side to make sure that the standard operating procedure along with the automation that sits behind it can orchestrate a very successful and capable response. And lastly, the third area is that it accelerates response as a whole. The Rave 911 suite provides very critical information to both 911 and dispatchers in terms of location information of where individuals are, other information, such as video directly from the site, and also Reva allows for cross-jurisdictional information sharing. You take all those three capabilities with enterprise security and command center, it really enhances our overall portfolio. And as Greg said, the one plus one here is actually much greater than two.\nAdam Tindle: Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe following up on kind of that Rave response, which was very helpful just kind of in laying out the integration. I guess just is there any timeline to kind of integrating the solution that your Video solution or Command Center could kind of interoperate more seamlessly with Rave, or is that already kind of built into the solution? Just kind of getting a sense of when the one-to-one really does become more than two and if there's any timeline to that? And then maybe just a second question. Obviously, the backlog has grown pretty significantly. Are there any meaningful changes to duration that we should just be mindful of when thinking about that backlog and how it would peel off? Thank you.\nJack Molloy: Just starting with the timeline elements. There are many elements of what I just outlined that already exist today, and they are integrated in various ways today. What we would like to do, and that's -- this is the future-looking element of it where we unify more of these solutions within our Command Center product portfolio, but also the Video Security and Access Control portfolio. And that is to come, and that it helps us enhance the use cases and make our products more differentiated. But some of the key capabilities in terms of being able to connect a detection that happens on the public safety side, and that's leading to an informed response on the command center side, whether that's 911 or dispatch, those capabilities exist today. And along with the incident, mass notification capability, being able to appropriately alert people, inform people during a situation, all those capabilities exist today. So there's more to come on this, but the base capability where the one plus one is greater than two, that's today.\nJason Winkler: On the backlog. So our backlog, not only is it up in total to the $14.3 billion, it's up $900 million in products. And the duration of our backlog is even better than it had been last year. So we're in a strong position for backlog as well as the continued expectation for the orders that we execute on during the year.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Meta.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nSami Badri: Hi, thank you very much, and congrats to what's a very robust 4Q and very robust 2023 guidance. My question has to do with the APX NEXT orders and just the typical refresh rates of public safety institutions and how they order your radios. The question is, are the ARPA funds and are the elevated levels of state and local budget catalyzing a compression in the typical refresh rate of LMR radios, which is partially explaining the strength you're seeing in LMR?\nJack Molloy: Sami, it's Jack. So as I said, I believe it was in the August call that we're in the early innings of the P25 upgrade cycle in North America. A couple of things to point out. Number one, APX NEXT was introduced at the highest tier of the market, and that's where it's been focused. Just recently, meaning the second half of 2022, we've filled in that portfolio. So now we have a mid-tier APX NEXT available. That in and of itself will be an accelerant for a lot of what you call suburban and county municipalities outside of the big cities. We've done $370 million of orders since the product was announced. To give you a feel for the accelerant, $210 million of orders in 2022. And without question, the ARPA funding will be an accelerant to -- it used to be a 10-year kind of refresh cycle, we've seen that pull into like a seven-year refresh cycle. But I'd point you to the City of Houston that actually leverage largely ARPA funds, but actually use some budgets that they had surpluses in their own budget to move forward this device. I think there's a few things that really driving this. People want to do more with their device. And so, clearly, the ability to extend the network as people go to do mutual [indiscernible] events, SmartConnect, the owner experience. I mean a big city police department, it's tough to get technicians. It used to take them 10,000 man hours to actually upgrade software, cyber fixes and those kind of bug refreshes, that can be done in 10 minutes now, leveraging the LTE compatibility. And the last thing is location matters. And what we've seen is GPS provisioning that capability even through our CAD networks has been a big add for our customers. And so there's clearly been a lot of excitement. You've seen a lot of very marquee police departments. And I think with the mid-tier series launching, I think we're going to continue to see that accelerant. And just to be clear, we did $210 million of orders last year. I expect to do double that this year.\nGreg Brown: And it's fair to say I think -- I think APX NEXT is probably the most successful LMR product we've launched, certainly in my tenure and the most successful for all of the reasons that Jack talked about, private network, public network, seamless roaming, LMR to LTE and all the operational cost savings. Yes, obviously, the funding environment helps, but the product itself is so strong in what it does and unique in its capabilities, I think that is as significant as anything.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you for giving us color. The one other follow-up question is, I think we can clearly see where you guys are going with Rave mobility. But I think the bigger question for analysts is when we look at Rave, when we look at Ava Security, and we look at a bunch of these other acquisitions you have made, they all look like they're going to have to be integrated on the back end and then offered in a much more broader way to a lot of your customers for much bigger type of consumption model. How far away -- how far away are you guys from offering this or being market-ready with a fully integrated suite in the back end that can really service the front-end consumption side?\nMahesh Saptharishi: So I think we've talked about our Safety Reimagined program a few times before. And a key element of that Safety Reimagine program is actually to bring all these elements together in an integrated fashion and facilitate the orchestration of incident response in a manner where that response is more effective. So with that in mind, we have actually spent time developing a piece of software called Orchestrate which actually starts connecting these different pieces together and very visually allows enterprise security professionals and even public safety professionals to be able to say, this is how the automation behind the scenes of events going from, say, us being able to detect [indiscernible] visually in the field of view of camera should trigger, say, an access control lockdown, that access control lockdown in turn can perhaps trigger a mass notification to people in the facility, that mass notification then -- following that triggers a call to 911, dispatchers are now informed as to where individuals are. This is -- these are capabilities that between our Collaborate platform, our Orchestrate platform we're able to do today. And I think as a solution, we are starting to sell Safety Reimagined as a solution.\nJason Winkler: In addition to the product integration and the road map that Mahesh described, I think, as Greg mentioned earlier, we're excited about Rave because it allows us to extend our sales channel to selling into public safety and education. So immediately, that organization gets the power of Jack Molloy's entire sales organization, selling the product as it is today into those accounts. And that in part is why we believe we're the most valuable owner of that asset.\nJack Molloy: Sami, just a couple of other points I think are important to point out. We see the video security market, in particular, fixed video security, there really is a little bit of divergence in terms of view of on-prem customers that want an on-prem solution for certain critical infrastructure markets. And then you've seen another market that without question, from VMS -- from a video security, but also from an access control standpoint, they are starting to accelerate to cloud. We've done a couple of things to take advantage. So moving forward, we're going to have the capabilities to deliver if you're an on-prem customer or you're a cloud customer, you'll be able to leverage the analytics that we've cultivated within our camera portfolio. That's important. The other thing that's important is, as you remember, we also acquired IndigoVision and Pelco. And we had three different essentially VMSs that we had to support. We've unified that experience under ACC8, Avigilon Control Center 8, which is our VMS. So there has been progress to your point. I just want to make sure you understood a couple of those things as well.\nSami Badri: Awesome. Thank you very much.\nGreg Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Fahad Najam with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nFahad Najam: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to kind of look at the linearity of your outlook, you're guiding 1Q 2023 revenue to grow 12% to 13%, yet full year you're guiding maybe at 7% year-on-year growth. So kind of -- I understand lead times haven't changed for your supply chain, but the global supply chain outlook is indeed improving, you might see it later in the year. But still, I'm trying to question the linearity that you're implying it implies almost like a slowdown in the second half of the year, which sounds counterintuitive. So can you walk me through your assumptions?\nJason Winkler: Sure. Fahad, I would point you to, first, the comp set from last year where in the first half, we grew at a rate of 8% and the second half a rate of almost double that. So if you look at last year's comps, it in part informs our expectations for growth this year. Secondly, we talked about this $80 million PCR business model change moving to license. The majority of that impact is occurring in the second half for us. That helps inform what we expect for growth all year, but higher growth in the first half. And as Greg mentioned, with lead times unchanged, we forecast the business based on the lead times that our suppliers commit to us, and we update it as the year progresses. And our current guide is informed by our supply commitments. We just had a summit with our top 20 suppliers yesterday and have the latest information and commitments from them. And we'll continue to work the supply environment proactively, which we did in 2022.\nFahad Najam: For my follow-up, I wanted to ask your thoughts on your revenue growth outlook for video surveillance. You've been talking 20% growth. But over the last two years, you've grown that business 30%-plus. If I'm not mistaken, the FCC has now recently announced a more wider band of that [indiscernible] Dahua products that has far bigger implications probably favorably for your business. So how should we be thinking about and how are you thinking about your video surveillance revenue growth in 2023? And how does this new SEC ban impact your business?\nJack Molloy: Sure, Fahad. So our outlook for the 2023 is 15% growth. But I'd point out 15% off a pretty significantly difficult comp, we grew 24% in 2022. We've kind of said in general, we think the NDAA is generally conducive. And we think it's -- within the mix, it's a tailwind to the business. But we don't think it's going to have any real profound impact over the course of 2023. But we're really excited, particularly as the things I just outlined. Our portfolio is coming together. We now have offerings from an on-prem standpoint as well as a cloud standpoint. But again, I think 15%, I also think it's important to take a look at where we're getting that -- where we're generating that growth. Government and education are two largest verticals. And we think they're a little bit insulated in terms of if there is any kind of economic slowdown. And the other piece of it is health care and the commercial market space as well.\nGreg Brown: Fahad, I'd also point out that some of the higher growth rates of Video Security, like in 2022 or before, the top revenue growth rate was in part driven by acquisitions. As you normalize those acquisitions and they go into the base and you look at the underlying strength of the growth rate between 2021 and 2022 and into 2023, it's much more comparable on a year-over-year basis.\nFahad Najam: I appreciate the answer. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Fahad.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Paul Chung with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPaul Chung: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So can you talk about kind of the operating leverage benefits you're seeing in the model? And I mean, you saw kind of modest growth in OpEx despite record revenues this year and very strong organic top line. So as we think about next year, how do we think about the pace of spend, kind of incremental costs related to Rave and other acquisitions? And you also mentioned gross margins up this year. Can you expand on the magnitude of your expectations there and the shape throughout the year? And I have one follow-up.\nJason Winkler: Sure. So I'll start with OpEx. I mentioned that we expect OpEx to be up $150 million this year. The primary drivers of that are, in fact, Rave, the recent acquisition, combined with investments that we continue to make within video, which is our fastest-growing technology. In terms of leverage, we saw the leverage that we expected in the second half of 2022 on the operating line, and we expect continued operating margin expansion in 2023. I mentioned in part, $50 million of a tailwind in lower costs for us to attain the supply in 2023, then what we had to pay in 2022, that will largely benefit the product segment. And we'll continue to expand operating margins with both the volume and price growth drivers that Greg mentioned earlier.\nPaul Chung: Okay. Great. And then on free cash flow, very strong performance here to end the year and despite $300 million working cap drag. It's always nice to see very strong earnings contribution kind of driving that free cash flow. But as we look to 2023, how do we think about working cap dynamics and overall trends for 2023, which could be a record year for free cash flow? Thank you.\nJason Winkler: Sure. So we out looked $1.9 billion in operating cash flow. CapEx will be pretty similar to last year. For a number of years now, our CapEx as a percent of OCF is around 15%. It's actually less than the 20% that we have in our capital allocation model, and that's likely to continue. We are a low CapEx asset light kind of model. So as OCF, we expect growth in OCF, we'll have higher earnings. I did mentioned $225 million higher cash tax amount that we are incorporating into 2023 as well. But we'll see good earnings growth, good cash flow growth, and we'll continue to work through inventory. Inventory has been a helpful investment for us as we navigated 2022. We'll plan and are planning for it to come down in 2023 as we fulfill record demand, but we'll continue to use it as an asset. It served us well in getting customer and meeting customer demand, but we'll continue to work through lower inventories in 2023.\nPaul Chung: Great, thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Housum: Good afternoon, guys and congratulations on a great quarter and our consistent performance for you guys. As we think about your product and system integration business, obviously, we saw you guys call out a lot of the APX NEXT refreshes, but there's only one systems update that was included in that list. Can you guys kind of talk about the mix between the system upgrades versus the device upgrades that you guys are going through? And are you guys seeing more of a movement back toward your device upgrades?\nJason Winkler: We're seeing both, Keith. The one thing I'd point to is that over the past several years, our customers have been transitioning to an always current upgrade arrangement, we call it SUA. It's a more predictable arrangement for them and keeps them on their journey technology wise. That revenue stream is more predictable for us. And a large number of customers in North America are on that journey for their infrastructure needs, which is a less lumpy systems business for us. So we'll continue to see devices upgrades. We told you where we are in the early innings of that. And we'll see systems upgrades, but we'll see it come through the P&L in both a product-related upgrade, but in some cases, higher services revenue for systems upgrades.\nJack Molloy: Jason, that's a good point. It's also -- this is pivoted more into a recurring revenue model and it will. There'll be elements of it in terms of replacing base stations for these networks that will continue to be an opportunity for us. But largely, it's come into software, meaning, it's an SUA program, as Jason pointed out, but also it's been -- it's been an accelerant for our Managed and Support Services business as well.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thanks. And as a follow-up question here. [indiscernible] the guidance here, Command Center growth expectations above 20% for 2023. Is the primary driver of that is the integration of Rave? Or are you guys seeing success elsewhere starting to pay dividends?\nJason Winkler: 20% includes the inorganic addition of Rave, but the rest of Command Center software also expected to grow low double digits, which is consistent with the expectation that we had and executed too in 2022.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thanks. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Louie DePalma with William Blair. Your line is open. Louis, please make sure that you're unmuted.\nLouie DiPalma: Greg, Jason, Jack, Mahesh, and Tim, good afternoon.\nGreg Brown: How are you?\nLouie DePalma: Doing well. Related to your Video division, the topic of artificial intelligence and machine learning has been in the financial mainstream recently with ChatGPT. Can you discuss how Motorola deserves to be in the conversation of leading AI vendors with some of your video analysis automation tech that you showcased at the IACP conference? And in general, how powerful are your AI tools now? And how has that progressed over the past couple of years? Thanks.\nMahesh Saptharishi: Sure. So ChatGPT, the technology that I think has been in development for quite a long time, and it really benefits from lots of advances in natural language understanding, reinforcement learning, the GPT, that stands for generative pretrained transformers, and it's the third generation of that tool. Now if you kind of break that up a little bit, the natural language elements of it, think of what we do on the smart transcription side, where we understand natural language, we are able to pick out entities that addresses names, license plate numbers, et cetera, and then map that into a capability to fill out forms, give supervisors a heads-up when a call taker potentially needs help, et cetera. On the video side, think of it as what we're doing, where we're taking video and actually converting that to language, so facilitating things like natural language searches. So being able to understand what is the user asking for and mapping that effectively into a set of results that are returned based upon our automated analysis of video. And we're able to do that at the edge. And with our acquisition of Calipsa, we're able to extend that capability into the cloud. And one of the things that Calipsa with the cloud AI allows us to do is very rapidly give -- provide this capability to multiple different cameras across the board, across all our portfolios, Pelco specifically, Avigilon inclusive of that as well. So those two things together give us the capability now to say, okay, if there's particular events that are happening, we can alert on them unusual activity being another one of them. So ChatGPT, I think, is just an indicator of one element or one area of machine learning that is really advanced. We're benefiting from multiple pieces of that across video understanding, across language understanding and audio understanding to the point where we're now implementing it across all our products. So hopefully, that's a rough answer to your question.\nLouie DePalma: Thanks. That was helpful. I'm sure you could talk for dozens of hours on that topic. One more question. Last week, Yes. Last week, the city of East Chicago and Indiana announced that it was deploying portable solar-powered video analytics platform from Avigilon. I was wondering, do you view solar powered cameras as a significant growth area for the Motorola video group?\nMahesh Saptharishi: So there's probably two areas, I'm not entirely sure of the specific opportunity you're talking about. But more broadly, we do have Avigilon cameras that are deployed today with solar platforms for [indiscernible] deploy applications. Many times, this is for construction sites for sort of sports events that happen or concert events that happen and you need a rapidly deploy solution. That is 1 part of it. The other part of it is on our automatic license plate recognition solution. We introduced the L6Q camera towards the end of last year. And that is a fully wireless solution. So it is a camera that is equipped with both video and radar as a detection mechanism. It is solar powered. It can be solar powered or it can be powered with a regular AC or DC connection. It also is LTE capable. So it is fully wireless in all its capabilities. And we are seeing a fairly rapid uptake in that solution because of its ease of install -- it is probably the easiest to install a video camera device out there today.\nLouie DePalma: Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks.\nGreg Brown: Thanks. Louie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nBen Bollin: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. The first item I had is, I'm curious, could you talk through the K-12 trends that you've seen as of late, talk to maybe materiality and how some of the COVID relief funding is starting to manifest. Mahesh talked about safety reimagine, but any other types of projects that you're seeing in that space would be helpful.\nJack Molloy: Sure. So I pointed out earlier, but education is -- it's our largest vertical in terms of Video Security & Access Control. There's been 170 million billion allocated to funding school safety. And it continues to outpace -- as much as we grew 24% last year, education continues to even outpace our growth in the overall business. It's one that school safety is paramount to what everyone is doing. And it's not only video security, it's access control, but it also brings in PCR radios and their ability to interoperate, to provide intelligence in terms of if there's an ingress/egress at a door, there's things that happen. I mean analytics play a huge role in driving a lot of our education success in terms of unusual motion detection, if there's an altercation in a cafeteria, think of things like that. Stadiums things happen with teenage kids in stadiums and those kind of things. So all those things have kind of culminated in a great opportunity. One of the things we did early days is we actually went out, hired a team to -- all they do is get up and focus every day in the educational space because one of our core beliefs here is we believe domain expertise, market knowledge matters in terms of going back and work with the product group and making sure we're making the right definition. The other thing I'd add, public schools get a lot of attention. But one of the reasons we look at Ava is we actually looked at a lot of private schools who actually wanted a cloud solution. We didn't have a solution before we bought Ava and we've identified opportunities to accelerate growth in the private education system as well there.\nBen Bollin: Okay. That's great. The follow-up is within Command Center, Greg, you spoke to 20% growth in 2023. Jason, I think you said ex Rave low doubles. If you look at Command Center as a percentage of mix, it's been pretty stable, about 7 points of revenue over the last several years. A lot of things going on. Could you talk a little bit about the sales motion there, the complexity of the systems and longer term, when you think that might be a bigger driver to the overall mix or grow as a percentage of the total, if you get a more widespread investment among those customers? That's it. Thank you.\nJack Molloy: Yeah. I mean I think the primary thing I'd point to there is we have -- you have to think about the Command Central market in terms of its very widespread. There are 6,500 public safety answering points in North America. And what you see taking place, and I think where we've talked about is, you've got -- historically, you had three to four different RFP cycles, meaning CAD RMS, you had a 911 system, you had consoles and radio consoles in some respect as well as Aware platform, which is more of a proactive mechanism to look at police. And what we're seeing, I think, particularly as we start to see newer and probably more technology savvy dispatchers enter the market, they want a unified experience. They want to look at a piece of software that is commonality instead of looking at four different things, operating with multiple different screens, different ways to interface to the technology. So I know that everybody would like this thing just to turn on and everybody go to kind of a Microsoft suite, the reality is, they've made investments. Some of them maybe just bought a new RMS system three years ago. And there's a cycle to that. But we think there's a cycle, and it's a benefit to us. And I think one of the things that Mahesh and his team have done a great job of is they put us in a position to have a conversation with a customer. It isn't bad for us if they buy those things in three different cycles because they buy from us. As long as they like the experience we deliver, we think there's a margin opportunity there as well.\nBen Bollin: Thanks, Jack.\nMahesh Saptharishi: [Technical Difficulty] And just looking at how we performed over 2022, our SaaS growth was actually 2 times that of command center total revenue. And today, about one-third of our command center software customers are actually they have at least 1 cloud-hosted hybrid solution in the mix there. And then we mentioned Greater Harris County as one of the deals this year -- or last quarter. An important element of that solution was -- the smart transcription solution that I mentioned previously and Greater Harris County is actually the largest smart transcription deployment to date. And so we are seeing more adoption of hybrid solutions going into that, and that's growing well for us.\nBen Bollin: Thanks, Mahesh.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open.\nPaul Silverstein: I appreciate that. I hope [indiscernible] last I could ask an awful lot of questions. But on a serious note, Greg, the guidance you'll give in organic terms, what does that translate to stripping out what you're expecting from Rave or any other contemplated acquisitions? And how does that compare to organic growth in 2022? I assume Rave is the only -- or the biggest inorganic piece this year?\nJason Winkler: Yes. It's largely Rave. Last year, inorganic revenues contributed $121 million to our -- and this year, it's largely the Rave of around $70-plus million from Rave. So that's the bridge.\nPaul Silverstein: You don't have -- in that guidance, you're not putting in anything in terms of prospective acquisitions other than Rave that was disclosed, and it's obviously less, a fair deal less than what acquisitions contributed?\nJason Winkler: It's the business as we see it and have it today. That's right.\nPaul Silverstein: All right. I appreciate that. And which ties into the next question, your LMR business just grew 9% last year following 7.6% growth the year before and 3.9% a year before that for a business that you historically have characterized understandably, I think it's low single digit. And so it came off a very strong year and had even strong growth. In terms of -- relative to the mid-single-digit guidance on LMR, I'm trying to understand the upside potential [indiscernible] assume the downside of this is one of the -- I'm trying to understand upside potential. Can you just review -- I know you've touched on it throughout the call, but can you review what were the key drivers in that? You mentioned that PCR was up. I don't think you gave us a number. I assume it was back up to the $1 billion level that you referenced in 2019. I think that was the level. But can you go through the various drivers, APX, PCR, et cetera, that contributed to that awfully strong growth? And what you're expecting going forward?\nGreg Brown: So Paul, I'd say let's start foundationally and thematically. I think it's a statement about the strength and durability of land mobile radio, first and foremost as a platform. LMR versus an LTE or cellular alternative, number one. Number two, we talk a lot about APX NEXT, APX NEXT being the premier high-tier device, most successful product launch MSI has ever had. Where customers are clamoring for it given the feature functionality, the LTE roaming, the over-the-air software efficiency that eliminates or minimizes their operating expense. And then we're taking APX NEXT, and we're introducing the APX NEXT mid-tier refresh. So you think about more broadly, there's 13,000 LMR networks around the world. You take a subset of that with better North American centric and P25 and you have a whole device portfolio refresh high-end led by APX NEXT, mid-tier then APX NEXT mid-tier. By the way, we're refreshing the TETRA portfolio as well, and we've continued to add and enhance the PCR portfolio. Then you add the backdrop of ARPA funding and state budgets that are as strong as they've been in years and PCR up [indiscernible] had best quarter it's ever had in and it has returned to prepandemic levels. And to your point, it's back to about $1 billion. And even with the business model change around PCR exiting certain countries in Asia, recognizing margin instead of full top end revenue, we still not expect to grow off of a record 2022. So you have device portfolio refresh, best-in-class product. This is a need to have, not a nice to have. That's not just a slogan. That's a reality and the demand for LMR [indiscernible] and the platforms and the feature functionality that comes with that, not to mention the integration of the Command Center and things like video security and Access Control are powering this technology forward. Now why mid-single digit? Because I remind you, we're still in a supply-constrained environment. Lead times are still the same as they were a quarter or two ago. if there's relief on that front or that changes throughout the year, we'll inform you. But that's what's driving that guide.\nPaul Silverstein: Greg, I think you just told us that if supply permits, demand would accommodate more than that mid-single digit, 5% guidance. But my last question, any update with respect to you all being able to collect on that not in substantial Hytera litigation award?\nGreg Brown: Work in progress. By the way, it's worth saying, Paul, that our expectation for cash flow in fiscal 2023 assumes no collection in that year. They owe us about $60 million. We've collected some a relatively de minimis amount. Our trial is the Civil trial. They have a 21 count criminal trial that begins at the DOJ federal level in February of 2024. We've asked the court to hold Hytera in contempt for failing to make a royalty payment. Look, it's a long slog. It's a multiyear fight against Hytera, but it's the right thing to do. We're going to protect the intellectual property of this firm. We'll see how it plays out. We had, by the way, they're defendant, [indiscernible] and plead guilty in the U.K., that's the senior engineering executive for Hytera that reported to the CEO, he changed his fee several months ago to guilty. So I know it takes long, and the wheels of justice grind relatively slowly, but we'll stay tuned and update you accordingly. But in terms of our forecasting or assumptions for fiscal 2023, there's zero from a cash standpoint.\nPaul Silverstein: I appreciate that. Guys, can I just clarify one thing going back to 1 more question. Greg, I think you and Jack and Jason have made the point historically previously that the new APX handsets accommodating the richer applications that require the new APX handset in order for your customers to deploy. I trust that's still the case, assuming the fact that there's a strong take-up of APX NEXT bodes well for take-up of the incremental command center software and LMR services, et cetera, and so one goes hand in hand with the other.\nGreg Brown: Well, the fact that the APX NEXT has software applications that are embedded in the capability of the device themselves. That platform is there to upgrade and add apps over time.\nPaul Silverstein: I appreciate it.\nGreg Brown: Yes, thank you, Paul.\nOperator: All right. Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any additional and closing remarks.\nGreg Brown: Thank you, everybody, and thank for joining the call. I would just summarize by saying what we do has never been more important than it is now. I mean, last year was a truly outstanding year. second consecutive year of double-digit top line revenue growth. We expanded operating margins despite the higher input costs around semiconductors. We acquired seven companies for the deployment and utilization of capital of $1.2 billion. The demand environment remains exceptionally strong, heading into this year. We've got strong multiyear funding. We've got record orders. We got record backlog. The exciting part is, we're at the intersection of public safety and enterprise security. And the width and breadth of our technology ecosystem, I think, further fortifies our role as a trusted adviser to our customers. I want to thank every single Motorolan that's listening into this call. This is an incredible company with this very strong purpose, passion, reengineering, innovation mentality. And as we heard yesterday in the supplier conference that Jason referenced and Jack, Mahesh and I participated in, these are special people with a commitment to serve and the commitment to the community. It's above and beyond. I appreciate everybody on the call. Thank you for joining, and we look forward to updating you again in a few months. I appreciate you all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the Internet within two hours. The website address is motorolasolutions.com/investor. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Jason Winkler",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 17% with record fourth quarter revenue in both segments and in all three technologies. Revenue exceeded our guidance and was driven by supply chain execution during the quarter, enabling higher product revenues in LMR. FX headwinds during the quarter were $87 million, while acquisitions added $39 million. GAAP operating earnings were $692 million, up 26% versus last year and GAAP operating margins were 25.6% compared with 23.7% in the prior year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $822 million [Technical Difficulty] GAAP operating margin was 30.4%, up from 28.9%. This was Motorola Solutions' first ever quarter of over 30% operating margin and was driven by the higher sales in both segments and the improved operating leverage, particularly in the Products and SI segment. GAAP earnings per share was $3.43, up from $2.30 in the year-ago quarter on higher sales and on a lower effective tax rate driven primarily by a $47 million or $0.27 per share tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance against U.S. foreign tax credits. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.60, up 26% from $2.85 last year, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage. OpEx in Q4 was $541 million, up $21 million versus last year, primarily due to acquisitions and higher incentives. For the full-year 2022, revenue was $9.1 billion, up 12% with strong growth in both segments and across all three technologies. The impact from unfavorable currency was $216 million and revenue from acquisitions was $121 million. GAAP operating earnings were $1.7 billion or 18.2% of sales versus 20.4% in the year prior. The decrease was primarily driven by the $147 million non-cash fixed asset impairment recognized in the current year related to our exit of ESN. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.4 billion, up $251 million and non-GAAP operating margins were 26% of sales, up from 25.9% in the year prior, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs, and higher expenses from acquisitions. GAAP earnings per share was $7.93, up 11% compared to the $7.17 in the year prior, driven by higher sales, a lower effective tax rate and partially offset by the asset impairment charge related to the ESN exit and higher material costs. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $10.36, up 13% from $9.15 in 2021 on higher sales, improved -- and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs. For the full year, our operating expenses were $2.1 billion, up $107 million from 2021, primarily driven by acquisitions and investments into our video business. And the effective tax rate for 2022 was 20% compared to 21% in the year prior, due to higher benefits from stock based compensation in the current year. Turning next to cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was a record $1.3 billion, up $570 million compared with the prior year, and free-cash-flow was $1.2 billion, up $565 million from 2021. Our record cash-flow performance during the quarter was driven by improved working capital and higher earnings. And for the full year, operating cash flow was $1.8 billion with free cash flow of $1.6 billion, consistent with the prior year. Higher earnings in 2022 were offset by the cash payments related to the increase in annual incentive payments earned in 2021 and higher inventory. Capital allocation for 2022 included $1.2 billion for acquisitions, $836 million in share repurchases at an average price of $225 per share, and $530 million in cash dividends. Additionally, during the year we issued $600 million of new long-term debt and repaid $275 million of outstanding debt. We also increased our dividend to 11%, our 12th consecutive year of double-digit increases. Moving next to our segment results. In Products and SI, strong demand continued with Q4 sales up 21%, including record revenue in both LMR and video. The currency headwinds were $43 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $20 million. Operating earnings in Q4 were $514 million or 28.4% of sales, up from 25.3% in the year prior, driven primarily by higher sales and operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs. Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include several large APX NEXT device orders, including $45 million from the City of Houston, $39 million from a large U.S. customer, $30 million from the City of Dallas, and a $21 million add-on order from a large U.S. customer that previously purchased APX NEXT devices. Additionally, during the quarter, we received a $20 million APX NEXT and Command Center order from Kansas City, a $19 million P25 System order for a large international customer, and a $3 million fixed order for metro rail in Chicago. For the full year, Products and SI revenue was $5.7 billion, up 14% from the prior year, driven by higher sales of LMR and Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $53 million and currency headwinds were $98 million. Full-year operating earnings were $1.2 billion or 20.5% of sales, up from 19.4% in the year prior on higher sales and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs. In Software and Services, Q4 revenue was 9% -- up 9%, which included $44 million of FX headwinds, and $19 million of revenue from acquisitions. Total software revenue was up 17% with double-digit growth in both video and Command Center, while in LMR Services revenue was up 5% after a $39 million FX headwind. Q4 operating earnings in the segment were $308 million or 34.4% of sales, down 100 basis points from last year, driven by unfavorable mix and higher acquisition expenses. Some notable Q4 highlights in this segment include a $56 million P25 multi-year extension of the managed services operations at Interexport which serves the Chilean National Law Enforcement Police; a $25 million P25 software upgrade renewal for a large U.S. customer; $22 million next generation 911 expansion, and renewal order for the Greater Harris County, Texas area; $21 million system upgrade in multiyear services renewal for Lane County Oregon; a $15 million P25 and command center upgrade order for Columbus, Georgia; and a $15 million license plate recognition camera system expansion order from the Illinois State Police. For the full year, revenue was $3.4 billion, up 8% on growth in video LMR services and command center. Revenue from acquisitions was $68 million and currency headwinds were $118 million. Full-year operating earnings were $1.2 billion or 35.3% of sales, down 110 basis points versus the prior year, driven by mix and higher acquisition expenses. Looking at our regional results. North America in Q4 revenue was $1.9 billion, up 18% on strong growth in both segments and in all three technologies. For the full year, North America revenue was $6.4 billion, up 15% with double-digit growth in both segments and in all three technologies. International Q4 revenue was $808 million, up 15% versus last year with growth in all three technologies. And for the full-year, International revenue was $2.7 billion, up 5% inclusive of the significant FX headwinds. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a record $14.3 billion, up $788 million or 6% compared to last year, inclusive of $418 million of unfavorable FX and a $99 million reduction related to the exit of the ESN contract. The backlog growth was driven by the continued record demand we're seeing across all three technologies. Sequentially, backlog was up $837 million, despite the record Q4 sales with growth in both segments. In the Products and SI segment, robust order demand in both LMR and video continues to drive record backlog, which was up $894 million or 22% compared to last year. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $68 million. This was our 10th consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth in this segment. In Software and Services, backlog was down $106 million compared to last year, which included $367 million of unfavorable FX, driven by Airwave and ESN revenue recognition and the ESN exit, partially offset by strong growth in North America multi-year services, and software contracts. Sequentially, Software and Services backlog was up $769 million or 9% driven by strong orders in North America and favorable FX adjustment from the prior quarter. Turning now to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up between 12% and 13%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.02 and $2.07 per share. This assumes $40 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately $172 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. For the full year, we expect sales between $9.65 billion and $9.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.10 and $11.22 per share. This assumes $40 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately $172 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. We expect full-year OpEx to be up approximately $150 million versus last year, driven by acquisitions we've made, and our continued investments in video. And we expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion. And finally, the reason our effective tax rate is expected to be up 300 basis points to 400 basis points over last year is due to lower excess tax benefits on share-based compensation in 2023 and a higher U.K. tax rate that takes effect in April. We're also anticipating approximately $300 million of higher cash taxes compared to last year, inclusive of a one-time $75 million tax payment that relates to an IP reorganization we did in 2022. Before I turn the call back to Greg, I wanted to update you on some strategic decisions we've made with respect to our PCR business. First, in order to further optimize our supply chain, we have moved the lowest part of PCR, which is sold to small businesses and some consumers to a licensed model with a third-party manufacturer. As a result of this change, we will only recognize revenues equal to the margin from the product. In addition, we made a decision to exit some PCR markets in Asia. We expect these changes together to constitute an $80 million headwinds to our 2022 -- 2023 revenues, which is fully contemplated in our full-year revenue guidance for 2023. And finally, we enter the New Year with an even stronger balance sheet. We ended 2022 with $1.3 billion of cash and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 2 times. In addition, our U.S. pension is in a strong funding position with over 80% funded reflecting the numerous actions we've implemented over the last several years. We have also proactively refinanced our debt maturities with fixed-rate long-term debt and established a balanced maturity profile with an average duration of approximately eight years. All of this gives us the flexibility to continue to deliver on our capital allocation framework and be opportunistic in M&A. I'll now turn the call back over to Greg. And Tim, I'll also remind you that the ARPU funding, $350 billion for state and local, $170 billion earmarked for education, but most importantly, it's multiyear funding and much of this will go into and through 2026. So, the foundation of funding and the strong environment Jack described, we capitalized in 2022 as he talked about the robustness of the funnel this year. But the best part of all is, it's multiyear dimension in nature. And Tim, from a gross margin perspective overall for MSI, we expect gross margins to be up in 2023. We also expect operating margins to be up in 2023. Thanks, Tim. Also Greg... Greg, the other thing that I'd offer insights into are our PCR business which in 2022 grew nicely. It's now back to 2019 levels. And a part of our backlog or unfulfilled orders for us or delays are in PCR. So we have a sizable amount of PCR backlog and demand, which we will continue to fulfill into 2023. A few more things to add on this. Greg already mentioned the vertical alignment that we have here, state and local government, education, which is significant for us, healthcare and corporate buildings. All of these are key areas where Rave plays a very important part. In Rave very critically as we mentioned before, connects enterprise security with public safety in some very unique ways and augments both sides of the portfolio. Probably three areas, technology areas that I want to highlight. The first is Rave enhances individual safety with mobile apps. So think about that as the Rave prepared capability where people with special needs can actually create a profile and offer information ahead of potentially something happening so that the response can actually be more effective. The second is the panic button. The ability to push a button and get help as needed, benefiting from what profile was created previously as needed as well. Rave Alert, which is a mass notification capability to keep people informed. So think about that as everything that covers people -- people's in safety, individual safety. The second area is facility preparedness. So think about the Rave facility capability where information about a facility can better inform a public safety response, including keeping responders safe and that's a very critical capability. Rave Collaborates help set up standard operating procedures of how someone should respond for various incidents ahead of when an incident actually happens. This very uniquely enables us to coordinate the ability that we have on the video security side and the command center side to make sure that the standard operating procedure along with the automation that sits behind it can orchestrate a very successful and capable response. And lastly, the third area is that it accelerates response as a whole. The Rave 911 suite provides very critical information to both 911 and dispatchers in terms of location information of where individuals are, other information, such as video directly from the site, and also Reva allows for cross-jurisdictional information sharing. You take all those three capabilities with enterprise security and command center, it really enhances our overall portfolio. And as Greg said, the one plus one here is actually much greater than two. On the backlog. So our backlog, not only is it up in total to the $14.3 billion, it's up $900 million in products. And the duration of our backlog is even better than it had been last year. So we're in a strong position for backlog as well as the continued expectation for the orders that we execute on during the year. In addition to the product integration and the road map that Mahesh described, I think, as Greg mentioned earlier, we're excited about Rave because it allows us to extend our sales channel to selling into public safety and education. So immediately, that organization gets the power of Jack Molloy's entire sales organization, selling the product as it is today into those accounts. And that in part is why we believe we're the most valuable owner of that asset. Sure. Fahad, I would point you to, first, the comp set from last year where in the first half, we grew at a rate of 8% and the second half a rate of almost double that. So if you look at last year's comps, it in part informs our expectations for growth this year. Secondly, we talked about this $80 million PCR business model change moving to license. The majority of that impact is occurring in the second half for us. That helps inform what we expect for growth all year, but higher growth in the first half. And as Greg mentioned, with lead times unchanged, we forecast the business based on the lead times that our suppliers commit to us, and we update it as the year progresses. And our current guide is informed by our supply commitments. We just had a summit with our top 20 suppliers yesterday and have the latest information and commitments from them. And we'll continue to work the supply environment proactively, which we did in 2022. Sure. So I'll start with OpEx. I mentioned that we expect OpEx to be up $150 million this year. The primary drivers of that are, in fact, Rave, the recent acquisition, combined with investments that we continue to make within video, which is our fastest-growing technology. In terms of leverage, we saw the leverage that we expected in the second half of 2022 on the operating line, and we expect continued operating margin expansion in 2023. I mentioned in part, $50 million of a tailwind in lower costs for us to attain the supply in 2023, then what we had to pay in 2022, that will largely benefit the product segment. And we'll continue to expand operating margins with both the volume and price growth drivers that Greg mentioned earlier. Sure. So we out looked $1.9 billion in operating cash flow. CapEx will be pretty similar to last year. For a number of years now, our CapEx as a percent of OCF is around 15%. It's actually less than the 20% that we have in our capital allocation model, and that's likely to continue. We are a low CapEx asset light kind of model. So as OCF, we expect growth in OCF, we'll have higher earnings. I did mentioned $225 million higher cash tax amount that we are incorporating into 2023 as well. But we'll see good earnings growth, good cash flow growth, and we'll continue to work through inventory. Inventory has been a helpful investment for us as we navigated 2022. We'll plan and are planning for it to come down in 2023 as we fulfill record demand, but we'll continue to use it as an asset. It served us well in getting customer and meeting customer demand, but we'll continue to work through lower inventories in 2023. We're seeing both, Keith. The one thing I'd point to is that over the past several years, our customers have been transitioning to an always current upgrade arrangement, we call it SUA. It's a more predictable arrangement for them and keeps them on their journey technology wise. That revenue stream is more predictable for us. And a large number of customers in North America are on that journey for their infrastructure needs, which is a less lumpy systems business for us. So we'll continue to see devices upgrades. We told you where we are in the early innings of that. And we'll see systems upgrades, but we'll see it come through the P&L in both a product-related upgrade, but in some cases, higher services revenue for systems upgrades. 20% includes the inorganic addition of Rave, but the rest of Command Center software also expected to grow low double digits, which is consistent with the expectation that we had and executed too in 2022. Yes. It's largely Rave. Last year, inorganic revenues contributed $121 million to our -- and this year, it's largely the Rave of around $70-plus million from Rave. So that's the bridge. It's the business as we see it and have it today. That's right."

            "content": "So I think we've talked about our Safety Reimagined program a few times before. And a key element of that Safety Reimagine program is actually to bring all these elements together in an integrated fashion and facilitate the orchestration of incident response in a manner where that response is more effective. So with that in mind, we have actually spent time developing a piece of software called Orchestrate which actually starts connecting these different pieces together and very visually allows enterprise security professionals and even public safety professionals to be able to say, this is how the automation behind the scenes of events going from, say, us being able to detect [indiscernible] visually in the field of view of camera should trigger, say, an access control lockdown, that access control lockdown in turn can perhaps trigger a mass notification to people in the facility, that mass notification then -- following that triggers a call to 911, dispatchers are now informed as to where individuals are. This is -- these are capabilities that between our Collaborate platform, our Orchestrate platform we're able to do today. And I think as a solution, we are starting to sell Safety Reimagined as a solution. Sure. So ChatGPT, the technology that I think has been in development for quite a long time, and it really benefits from lots of advances in natural language understanding, reinforcement learning, the GPT, that stands for generative pretrained transformers, and it's the third generation of that tool. Now if you kind of break that up a little bit, the natural language elements of it, think of what we do on the smart transcription side, where we understand natural language, we are able to pick out entities that addresses names, license plate numbers, et cetera, and then map that into a capability to fill out forms, give supervisors a heads-up when a call taker potentially needs help, et cetera. On the video side, think of it as what we're doing, where we're taking video and actually converting that to language, so facilitating things like natural language searches. So being able to understand what is the user asking for and mapping that effectively into a set of results that are returned based upon our automated analysis of video. And we're able to do that at the edge. And with our acquisition of Calipsa, we're able to extend that capability into the cloud. And one of the things that Calipsa with the cloud AI allows us to do is very rapidly give -- provide this capability to multiple different cameras across the board, across all our portfolios, Pelco specifically, Avigilon inclusive of that as well. So those two things together give us the capability now to say, okay, if there's particular events that are happening, we can alert on them unusual activity being another one of them. So ChatGPT, I think, is just an indicator of one element or one area of machine learning that is really advanced. We're benefiting from multiple pieces of that across video understanding, across language understanding and audio understanding to the point where we're now implementing it across all our products. So hopefully, that's a rough answer to your question. So there's probably two areas, I'm not entirely sure of the specific opportunity you're talking about. But more broadly, we do have Avigilon cameras that are deployed today with solar platforms for [indiscernible] deploy applications. Many times, this is for construction sites for sort of sports events that happen or concert events that happen and you need a rapidly deploy solution. That is 1 part of it. The other part of it is on our automatic license plate recognition solution. We introduced the L6Q camera towards the end of last year. And that is a fully wireless solution. So it is a camera that is equipped with both video and radar as a detection mechanism. It is solar powered. It can be solar powered or it can be powered with a regular AC or DC connection. It also is LTE capable. So it is fully wireless in all its capabilities. And we are seeing a fairly rapid uptake in that solution because of its ease of install -- it is probably the easiest to install a video camera device out there today. [Technical Difficulty] And just looking at how we performed over 2022, our SaaS growth was actually 2 times that of command center total revenue. And today, about one-third of our command center software customers are actually they have at least 1 cloud-hosted hybrid solution in the mix there. And then we mentioned Greater Harris County as one of the deals this year -- or last quarter. An important element of that solution was -- the smart transcription solution that I mentioned previously and Greater Harris County is actually the largest smart transcription deployment to date. And so we are seeing more adoption of hybrid solutions going into that, and that's growing well for us."

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and the outlook. First, our record Q4 results highlight the continued robust demand we're seeing for our public safety and enterprise security solutions. During the quarter we grew revenue 17%, earnings per share of 26%, expanded operating margins by 150 basis points, and generated a record $1.3 billion of operating cash flow. Additionally, orders remained strong, which led to record ending backlog of $14.3 billion, up $800 million versus last year. Second, 2022 was an outstanding year across the board. In our Products and Systems Integration segment, we grew revenue 14% driven by strong growth in both LMR and video security and we ended the year with record backlog, up 22% versus last year. We also expanded operating margins in the segment by 110 basis points despite higher costs related to semiconductors. In Software and Services, revenue was up 8% and 12% when normalized for FX headwinds, highlighted by double-digit growth in both video security and Command Center. And finally, as I look to 2023 [Technical Difficulty] positions us well for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth. I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook. Thanks, Jason. First, 2022 was a phenomenal year for the company. We achieved double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive year with record sales in both segments and all three technologies. We expanded operating margins despite the continued supply challenges related to semiconductors and we ended the year with a record $14.3 billion of backlog, up almost $800 million versus the prior year. Second, our acquisition of Rave Mobile Safety during Q4 was our seventh acquisition last year. Rave adds approximately $70 million of annual recurring revenue for 2023 and expands the company's addressable market by approximately $7 billion. Whether it's a student or a teacher alerting public safety with the push of a button or 911 call takers coordinating a more informed response, Rave Mobile Safety amplifies the connection between our video security and Command Center portfolios. Since 2015, we've invested almost $6 billion in acquiring companies that have helped us create a broad set of public safety and enterprise security solutions. These assets have helped to accelerate our revenue growth, diversify the composition of our revenue streams, and more than quadrupled our addressable market to what we now estimate to be $60 billion. And finally, as I look ahead, the momentum of our business remains strong. The funding environment for public safety and enterprise security remains exceptional. Our investments in APX NEXT device portfolio are driving a refresh cycle that is still in the very early days with less than 10% of customers' installed base upgraded to date. Our AI and Cloud solutions continue to help drive market-share gains in video security and command center software, and will continue to navigate the ongoing supply-chain challenges, I'm extremely pleased with how we're positioned as we enter this year and I expect it to be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth for the company. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Tim, and we'll take your questions. And Tim, I'll take the second part of your question. So as you recall, as we navigated through 2022 and having to secure parts from brokers, that year 2022 last year, we incurred about $165 million of higher costs for semiconductors in 2022 than 2021, that was a headwind for us. We -- we're able to get access to some parts in Q4. That's in part what helped our Q4 performance. So as we plan for 2023 now, we anticipate still needing to run the play of buying broker parts, it's still remains a difficult environment, particularly for automotive-grade semiconductors, but we do believe and are planning for about a $50 million tailwind in the total amount of dollars that we will allocate and spend to secure parts as for the plans we have in 2023. So $50 million tailwind in 2023 relative to 2022's cost profile. George, the answer is, no, to be candid with you. The environment is strong, the funding environment, as we talked about is exceptional, 75% of our business, as you know, as government and public safety, 25% is enterprise. We still see continued strength. This year we expect growth in all three technologies LMR to be mid-single digits, video security to be about 15%, command center to be about 20%. So -- and there was an article in the journal last weekend, the state budgets are as flush as they had been in several years. We talked already about the multiyear funding horizon for ARPA. Now, nobody is immune from a recession. We've always been diligent in managing the expense structure of the firm. The majority of the driver of higher OpEx for this company year on year and period on period is generally acquisitions. So, I think we have a great portfolio, a fantastic environment, strong demand, and we are acutely focused on continued execution, new product development, acquisition integration, and growing faster than the market versus our competitors. So, now I -- look, sometimes they worried that I'm not worried, okay? But the team is aligned and we feel really good about where we are. Appreciate the question. So, I would say the growth that we had last year, full-year was driven by both volume and price increase. I'd weight it a little bit more toward volume last year. That composition that drives our growth rate overall for this year is also volume and price. And I would weight it slightly towards volume again this year. We've exercised surgically and responsibly certain price increases that we've talked about a number of times last year. So, I think we're well-positioned going forward. And it's a great point, Jason because despite the fact that we had a great PCR Q4, really strong growth for the full year to Jason's point back to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. And he referenced an $80 million PC-oriented headwind, which represents a business model change even with those -- all those ingredients into the blender, we still are expecting PCR growth for 2023. Thank you. So what I'd say is, I'd remind you that CMA their stated intention is to make a final decision this month, maybe it's next month, but it's relatively soon. We remain unchanged in our finding and belief that with full conviction that their effort is disproportionate, it's unprecedented, it's overreaching. So our view on that is unchanged. Now recall the investigation -- the market investigation is grounded around Airwave and ESN. What I can update you on is that, we have successfully signed a contract with the UK Home Office to exit ESN. I think it was a good multi-month effort where both of us are satisfied, that will result, Adam, in us exiting ESN earlier than anticipated. We are doing a transition services agreement in 2023, but then effectively after 2023 we are out of ESN. So, I think that is an update that's worthy of sharing because a quarter ago we talked about our intention to do that, but that was before we actually codified and signed the agreement. Now having said all that, I think, look, as we guide the full-year we guide the full-year with the $80 million business model change around PCR. We guide the year both top and bottom with continued supply constraints and I think it's important to know that, because there's a lot of reports that supply chain is a lot better but for the businesses that we're in and we compete primarily with industrial providers or automotive for the semiconductors that we're contending for, it's not that changed, lead times actually are largely unchanged. So that informs our guidance as well and as we sit here, on February 9th, we think all-in, it's a prudent and balanced view of the year all things considered. Yeah, so we are very excited about the asset. And the important thing, Adam, is it's an asset that's worth more to us than anyone else. So when you think about the capital deployed against the backdrop of an addressable market that expands $7 billion and all ARR, annual recurring revenue with a run rate of $70 million that we like those attributes, their verticals. 80% of the business is profiled around state and local and education, which that too is absolutely in the sweet spot of what we do and how Molloy goes to market. So the asset we're excited about, I think it's worth and we think it's worth more to us than anyone else and we've done an extensive view of the industry as well and we're excited about what it means. Thanks, Adam. Thanks, Meta. And it's fair to say I think -- I think APX NEXT is probably the most successful LMR product we've launched, certainly in my tenure and the most successful for all of the reasons that Jack talked about, private network, public network, seamless roaming, LMR to LTE and all the operational cost savings. Yes, obviously, the funding environment helps, but the product itself is so strong in what it does and unique in its capabilities, I think that is as significant as anything. Thank you. Fahad, I'd also point out that some of the higher growth rates of Video Security, like in 2022 or before, the top revenue growth rate was in part driven by acquisitions. As you normalize those acquisitions and they go into the base and you look at the underlying strength of the growth rate between 2021 and 2022 and into 2023, it's much more comparable on a year-over-year basis. Thanks, Fahad. Thanks, Paul. How are you? Thanks. Louie. So Paul, I'd say let's start foundationally and thematically. I think it's a statement about the strength and durability of land mobile radio, first and foremost as a platform. LMR versus an LTE or cellular alternative, number one. Number two, we talk a lot about APX NEXT, APX NEXT being the premier high-tier device, most successful product launch MSI has ever had. Where customers are clamoring for it given the feature functionality, the LTE roaming, the over-the-air software efficiency that eliminates or minimizes their operating expense. And then we're taking APX NEXT, and we're introducing the APX NEXT mid-tier refresh. So you think about more broadly, there's 13,000 LMR networks around the world. You take a subset of that with better North American centric and P25 and you have a whole device portfolio refresh high-end led by APX NEXT, mid-tier then APX NEXT mid-tier. By the way, we're refreshing the TETRA portfolio as well, and we've continued to add and enhance the PCR portfolio. Then you add the backdrop of ARPA funding and state budgets that are as strong as they've been in years and PCR up [indiscernible] had best quarter it's ever had in and it has returned to prepandemic levels. And to your point, it's back to about $1 billion. And even with the business model change around PCR exiting certain countries in Asia, recognizing margin instead of full top end revenue, we still not expect to grow off of a record 2022. So you have device portfolio refresh, best-in-class product. This is a need to have, not a nice to have. That's not just a slogan. That's a reality and the demand for LMR [indiscernible] and the platforms and the feature functionality that comes with that, not to mention the integration of the Command Center and things like video security and Access Control are powering this technology forward. Now why mid-single digit? Because I remind you, we're still in a supply-constrained environment. Lead times are still the same as they were a quarter or two ago. if there's relief on that front or that changes throughout the year, we'll inform you. But that's what's driving that guide. Work in progress. By the way, it's worth saying, Paul, that our expectation for cash flow in fiscal 2023 assumes no collection in that year. They owe us about $60 million. We've collected some a relatively de minimis amount. Our trial is the Civil trial. They have a 21 count criminal trial that begins at the DOJ federal level in February of 2024. We've asked the court to hold Hytera in contempt for failing to make a royalty payment. Look, it's a long slog. It's a multiyear fight against Hytera, but it's the right thing to do. We're going to protect the intellectual property of this firm. We'll see how it plays out. We had, by the way, they're defendant, [indiscernible] and plead guilty in the U.K., that's the senior engineering executive for Hytera that reported to the CEO, he changed his fee several months ago to guilty. So I know it takes long, and the wheels of justice grind relatively slowly, but we'll stay tuned and update you accordingly. But in terms of our forecasting or assumptions for fiscal 2023, there's zero from a cash standpoint. Well, the fact that the APX NEXT has software applications that are embedded in the capability of the device themselves. That platform is there to upgrade and add apps over time. Yes, thank you, Paul. Thank you, everybody, and thank for joining the call. I would just summarize by saying what we do has never been more important than it is now. I mean, last year was a truly outstanding year. second consecutive year of double-digit top line revenue growth. We expanded operating margins despite the higher input costs around semiconductors. We acquired seven companies for the deployment and utilization of capital of $1.2 billion. The demand environment remains exceptionally strong, heading into this year. We've got strong multiyear funding. We've got record orders. We got record backlog. The exciting part is, we're at the intersection of public safety and enterprise security. And the width and breadth of our technology ecosystem, I think, further fortifies our role as a trusted adviser to our customers. I want to thank every single Motorolan that's listening into this call. This is an incredible company with this very strong purpose, passion, reengineering, innovation mentality. And as we heard yesterday in the supplier conference that Jason referenced and Jack, Mahesh and I participated in, these are special people with a commitment to serve and the commitment to the community. It's above and beyond. I appreciate everybody on the call. Thank you for joining, and we look forward to updating you again in a few months. I appreciate you all."

            "name": "Jack Molloy",
            "content": "So, this is Jack. I'll take the first question. I think it was regarding the federal funding, but really good news. So we had over $400 million of orders in 2022. But I think most importantly, the $350 billion that was allocated state and local is a multiyear funding phenomenon. So we look at our multiyear funnel out through 2026 at being north of $1 billion. Some of the deals that Jason cited were funded in part or in -- completely funded by ARPA dollar. So we've had good success. Our team is really -- our sales team in North America traditionally really understands funding models and I think they're working it well, and we've seen good results. Just starting with the timeline elements. There are many elements of what I just outlined that already exist today, and they are integrated in various ways today. What we would like to do, and that's -- this is the future-looking element of it where we unify more of these solutions within our Command Center product portfolio, but also the Video Security and Access Control portfolio. And that is to come, and that it helps us enhance the use cases and make our products more differentiated. But some of the key capabilities in terms of being able to connect a detection that happens on the public safety side, and that's leading to an informed response on the command center side, whether that's 911 or dispatch, those capabilities exist today. And along with the incident, mass notification capability, being able to appropriately alert people, inform people during a situation, all those capabilities exist today. So there's more to come on this, but the base capability where the one plus one is greater than two, that's today. Sami, it's Jack. So as I said, I believe it was in the August call that we're in the early innings of the P25 upgrade cycle in North America. A couple of things to point out. Number one, APX NEXT was introduced at the highest tier of the market, and that's where it's been focused. Just recently, meaning the second half of 2022, we've filled in that portfolio. So now we have a mid-tier APX NEXT available. That in and of itself will be an accelerant for a lot of what you call suburban and county municipalities outside of the big cities. We've done $370 million of orders since the product was announced. To give you a feel for the accelerant, $210 million of orders in 2022. And without question, the ARPA funding will be an accelerant to -- it used to be a 10-year kind of refresh cycle, we've seen that pull into like a seven-year refresh cycle. But I'd point you to the City of Houston that actually leverage largely ARPA funds, but actually use some budgets that they had surpluses in their own budget to move forward this device. I think there's a few things that really driving this. People want to do more with their device. And so, clearly, the ability to extend the network as people go to do mutual [indiscernible] events, SmartConnect, the owner experience. I mean a big city police department, it's tough to get technicians. It used to take them 10,000 man hours to actually upgrade software, cyber fixes and those kind of bug refreshes, that can be done in 10 minutes now, leveraging the LTE compatibility. And the last thing is location matters. And what we've seen is GPS provisioning that capability even through our CAD networks has been a big add for our customers. And so there's clearly been a lot of excitement. You've seen a lot of very marquee police departments. And I think with the mid-tier series launching, I think we're going to continue to see that accelerant. And just to be clear, we did $210 million of orders last year. I expect to do double that this year. Sami, just a couple of other points I think are important to point out. We see the video security market, in particular, fixed video security, there really is a little bit of divergence in terms of view of on-prem customers that want an on-prem solution for certain critical infrastructure markets. And then you've seen another market that without question, from VMS -- from a video security, but also from an access control standpoint, they are starting to accelerate to cloud. We've done a couple of things to take advantage. So moving forward, we're going to have the capabilities to deliver if you're an on-prem customer or you're a cloud customer, you'll be able to leverage the analytics that we've cultivated within our camera portfolio. That's important. The other thing that's important is, as you remember, we also acquired IndigoVision and Pelco. And we had three different essentially VMSs that we had to support. We've unified that experience under ACC8, Avigilon Control Center 8, which is our VMS. So there has been progress to your point. I just want to make sure you understood a couple of those things as well. Sure, Fahad. So our outlook for the 2023 is 15% growth. But I'd point out 15% off a pretty significantly difficult comp, we grew 24% in 2022. We've kind of said in general, we think the NDAA is generally conducive. And we think it's -- within the mix, it's a tailwind to the business. But we don't think it's going to have any real profound impact over the course of 2023. But we're really excited, particularly as the things I just outlined. Our portfolio is coming together. We now have offerings from an on-prem standpoint as well as a cloud standpoint. But again, I think 15%, I also think it's important to take a look at where we're getting that -- where we're generating that growth. Government and education are two largest verticals. And we think they're a little bit insulated in terms of if there is any kind of economic slowdown. And the other piece of it is health care and the commercial market space as well. Jason, that's a good point. It's also -- this is pivoted more into a recurring revenue model and it will. There'll be elements of it in terms of replacing base stations for these networks that will continue to be an opportunity for us. But largely, it's come into software, meaning, it's an SUA program, as Jason pointed out, but also it's been -- it's been an accelerant for our Managed and Support Services business as well. Sure. So I pointed out earlier, but education is -- it's our largest vertical in terms of Video Security & Access Control. There's been 170 million billion allocated to funding school safety. And it continues to outpace -- as much as we grew 24% last year, education continues to even outpace our growth in the overall business. It's one that school safety is paramount to what everyone is doing. And it's not only video security, it's access control, but it also brings in PCR radios and their ability to interoperate, to provide intelligence in terms of if there's an ingress/egress at a door, there's things that happen. I mean analytics play a huge role in driving a lot of our education success in terms of unusual motion detection, if there's an altercation in a cafeteria, think of things like that. Stadiums things happen with teenage kids in stadiums and those kind of things. So all those things have kind of culminated in a great opportunity. One of the things we did early days is we actually went out, hired a team to -- all they do is get up and focus every day in the educational space because one of our core beliefs here is we believe domain expertise, market knowledge matters in terms of going back and work with the product group and making sure we're making the right definition. The other thing I'd add, public schools get a lot of attention. But one of the reasons we look at Ava is we actually looked at a lot of private schools who actually wanted a cloud solution. We didn't have a solution before we bought Ava and we've identified opportunities to accelerate growth in the private education system as well there. Yeah. I mean I think the primary thing I'd point to there is we have -- you have to think about the Command Central market in terms of its very widespread. There are 6,500 public safety answering points in North America. And what you see taking place, and I think where we've talked about is, you've got -- historically, you had three to four different RFP cycles, meaning CAD RMS, you had a 911 system, you had consoles and radio consoles in some respect as well as Aware platform, which is more of a proactive mechanism to look at police. And what we're seeing, I think, particularly as we start to see newer and probably more technology savvy dispatchers enter the market, they want a unified experience. They want to look at a piece of software that is commonality instead of looking at four different things, operating with multiple different screens, different ways to interface to the technology. So I know that everybody would like this thing just to turn on and everybody go to kind of a Microsoft suite, the reality is, they've made investments. Some of them maybe just bought a new RMS system three years ago. And there's a cycle to that. But we think there's a cycle, and it's a benefit to us. And I think one of the things that Mahesh and his team have done a great job of is they put us in a position to have a conversation with a customer. It isn't bad for us if they buy those things in three different cycles because they buy from us. As long as they like the experience we deliver, we think there's a margin opportunity there as well."

First, our Q3 results highlight the continued strong demand and robust funding environment that we're seeing across the business. We grew revenue 13%, EPS 28%, and expanded operating margins by 220 basis points. Additionally, we ended the quarter with record Q3 ending backlog of $13.5 billion, up 19% from last year, inclusive of over $800 million of unfavorable currency impact. Second, we achieved record Q3 revenue in both segments in Products and Systems Integration, increased demand for video security and land mobile radio technologies and continued solid execution in our supply chain led to revenue growth of 15% during the quarter. And in Software and Services revenue was up 8% and 13% when normalized for FX. And finally, based on our exceptionally strong Q3 results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS for the second consecutive time, despite full year FX headwinds that now total about $220 million up $50 million from our expectations last quarter. So at this point, I will now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 13% and was above our guidance with record third quarter revenue in both segments. We also saw growth across all three technologies led by 33% growth in video security and access control. In LMR, which grew 9%, our supply chain execution during the quarter enabled us to ship additional product revenue. FX headwinds during the quarter were $66 million, while acquisitions added $32 million. GAAP operating earnings were $373 million inclusive of $147 million non-cash fixed asset impairment charge recognized during the quarter related to the now planned exit from the ESN contract. GAAP operating margins were 15.7%. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $676 million, up 22% from the year ago quarter. And non-GAAP operating margin was 28.5%, up from 26.3%. This increase in operating margin was driven by higher sales, higher gross margins, and improved operating leverage, particularly in the Products and SI segment. GAAP earnings per share were a $1.63 compared to a $1.76 per share in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the impairment charge related to the expected early exit of the ESN contract. Non-GAAP EPS was $3 per share, up 28% from $2.35 last year. This strong growth in EPS was driven by higher sales in margins, as well as a lower affected tax rate related to higher benefits from stock comp recognized in the current year. OpEx in Q3 was $521 million up $25 million versus last year, primarily due to acquisitions. Turning to cash flow Q3 operating cash flow was $388 million, up $12 million compared with the prior year. And free cash flow was $318 million up $3 million. For the full year we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $100 million lower than our prior guidance, primarily due to our continued investment in inventory, which is helping us execute in a dynamic supply chain environment and deliver against the continued record demand we're seeing in video security and LMR. Capital allocation for Q3 included $132 million in cash dividends, $94 million in share repurchases and $70 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Barrett Communications, a specialty supplier of high frequency and tactical communications equipment for $18 million net of cash. Moving to segment results in the Products and SI segment, we continue to see strong demand across both LMR and video. Sales during the quarter, were up 15% versus last year and orders were up 29%, including record Q3 orders for both LMR and video. Currency headwinds were $28 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter contributed $13 million. Operating earnings were $375 million or 24.5% of sales up from 20.6% in the prior year, driven primarily by higher sales and operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs. The impact from our pricing actions increased in Q3 as expected, and we continue to expect full year operating margins in this segment to be higher than last year. Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in the segment include an order in Israel valued at over $400 million for a duration of 25 years. This unique system integration project also includes over $30 million of fixed video equipment and software, and is our single largest order ever for Avigilon.  $165 million P25 System and APX NEXT devices award received from Miami-Dade County that includes a new customer for us in the state of Florida; a $67 million P25 order from Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority; a $45 million P25 order from a customer in Africa; a $29 million P25 devices order from a U.S. federal customer, an $18 million TETRA order from a customer in Europe, and a $5 million fixed video order from a major transportation company in North Africa.  In Software and Services revenue was up 8%, which includes $38 million of FX headwinds and $19 million of revenue from acquisitions. Total software revenue was up 17% driven by strong demand in video, while in LMR services revenue was up 4% after $33 million of FX headwinds. Operating earnings in the segment were $301 million or 35.7% of sales, down 30 basis points from last year driven by higher acquisition expenses. Some notable Q3 highlights in the segment include two large multi-year LMR service renewals, a $43 million won with the State of Maryland and $15 million with the City of Phoenix. Also, a $17 million push-to-talk over broadband order from a customer in the Middle East, a $7 million command center software renewal with Will County, Illinois, a $4 million body-worn camera order for the Texas Department of Public Safety, and a $4 million command center software suite order for Ellis County, Texas. Looking at regional results, North America Q3 revenue was $1.7 billion, up 16% on growth in all three technologies. International Q3 revenue was $686 million, up 4% versus last year with growth in all three technologies, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Moving to our backlog, ending backlog was a Q3 record of $13.5 billion, up 19% or $2.1 billion compared to last year, inclusive of approximately $826 million of unfavorable FX and a $99 million orders reduction related to the planned exit from the ESN contract. The growth was driven by the Airwave extension recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021, and increased demand across all three technologies. Sequentially backlog was up $87 million driven by several large orders received during the quarter, partially offset by $411 million of unfavorable FX and the $99 million adjustment for ESN. In the Products and SI segment, robust order demand in both LMR and video continues to drive record backlog, which was up $1.2 billion or 35% compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $513 million, which was our ninth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth in this segment. In Software and Services backlog was up $876 million compared to last year, driven by the Airwave extension and a $288 million increase in multi-year services and software contracts in North America, partially offset by $722 million of unfavorable FX and the adjustment related to ESN. So sequentially backlog was down $426 million or 5% driven primarily by unfavorable FX, the ESN adjustment and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN during the quarter. Turning now to our outlook, we expect Q4 sales to be up approximately 9% with non-GAAP earnings per share, between $3.40 and $3.45 per share. This assumes $90 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. For the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance again. We now expect revenue growth between 9.25% and 9.5% up from our prior guidance of 8%. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $10.17 and $10.22 per share, up from our prior guidance of $10.03 to $10.13 per share. This updated guidance now includes full year FX headwinds of $220 million, up $50 million from our prior guidance, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 20.5%. This now also assumes $150 million of higher costs for the full year related to the procurement of semiconductors from secondary markets at a premium. This is a $30 million increase over what we indicated earlier in the year and supports the increased revenue included in our updated guidance today. And finally, as I reflect on where we stand today with just two months left in another dynamic year, I'm encouraged with how our teams have been navigating the supply chain environment and overcoming the impact of a historically strong U.S. dollar. At the beginning of the year, we expected currency headwinds to have a $60 million translation impact on our full year revenues. The full year FX headwind has increased by $160 million since then. The decisions we've made to carry higher inventory pay premiums for semiconductors and the pricing actions we implemented have enabled us to drive higher product revenues that not only offset these significant FX headwinds and but have materially increased our revenue and EPS expectations during the year. I'll now turn the call back over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Jason. I'm really pleased with our Q3 results, and I'm extremely proud of the people here at Motorola and how our team continues to execute across all areas of the business. We achieved record Q3 sales in both segments, EPS is up by 28%. We expanded operating margins by 220 basis points, and we ended the quarter with a record ending backlog of $13.5 billion, up 19%. And again, that's in the face of some significant FX headwinds. Second, we continue to deliver these strong results while also continuing to invest in both new products and strengthening our ecosystem. During the quarter, we extended our successful APX NEXT device portfolio with three additional radios that support agencies of all sizes, personnel needs and budgets. We announced several new video integrations into CommandCentral Aware, bringing body-worn in car and emergency drone video feeds into the command center and we expanded our suite of cloud-connected cameras with the Ava Quad, a cloud-native forehead camera with built-in analytics. And finally, as I look ahead, the momentum of our business is strong. Our investments in the portfolio, combined with a robust funding environment are driving increased demand for our solutions, our supply chain execution and higher inventory is helping us navigate a continually challenging environment to meet this record demand and our record Q3 backlog positions us well for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth into 2023. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim, and we'll open it up for your questions.\nTim Yocum: Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Tim Long. I have two questions, if I may. You guys had mentioned in your release and prepared remarks about exiting your ESN contract. And just kind of trying to get a little bit more color there, is that just managing the contract? Or would that also be inclusive of the Kodiak revenue? And is there anything more you think you'll need to kind of concede in negotiations with the home office? And then just kind of given the raised guidance now, how should we kind of high level think about 2023 expectations? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Yes, in terms of ESN, Lisa, I think it's a result of ongoing conversations with the customer. I think more recently, they reached an advanced stage, kind of a late-stage negotiation where at this point, we think it's more likely than not that we will be exiting ESN earlier than the expiration of 2024. We don't have an agreement signed with them at this point. But I think there's mutual interest in reaching that conclusion and we continue to work toward that end. So I think we both think it's the right thing to do and a reasonable way forward. Look, in terms of 2023, and I know we have a lot of good news for the Q3 print. It's a little bit \u2013 a little bit early to think about. There's still a lot of moving parts. I think at this point in time, we think about revenue of about $9.5 billion in 2023. We expect at that level, we could grow within all three technologies. But it's also worth noting that there's still some things that we'll be dealing with into 2023. I think that the supply chain constraints around semiconductor, which we're still experiencing, which is one example of why Jason referenced, we're carrying higher inventory purposely and carrying and paying more higher PPV premiums. But I think that those semiconductor supply chain challenges continue into next year and therefore, I think our higher inventory levels will continue well into 2023. I also think, again, at the moment, we have FX headwinds that look about $150 million, of which, by the way, more than half of that would be actually in Q1 alone. And then one other just thing to think about for all of us in terms of 2023 is we expect about 200 to 300 basis points of higher tax rate headwinds in 2023 that will inform our thinking. But those are high-level chalk to field thoughts at this moment, and we would \u2013 we'll obviously give you the specifics in February.\nJason Winkler: Lisa, if I could also add color to your question around ESN. So the revenues this year for ESN are going to be approximately $65 million. That includes some of the MCPTT as well as the integration and the project. As Greg mentioned, with the exit of the contract, that will go to zero in 2024. We're working through as part of the negotiation, what transition services and what that looks like in terms of revenue for next year. So we'll update you on that as it concludes. But $65 million in this year's top line results from ESN.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you so much.\nGreg Brown: Thanks Lisa.\nOperator: We now turn to George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys, thanks very much and congratulations on all the growth and crisp execution here. I guess, I wanted to just keep going on the same line of questioning. Does the exit of the ESN contract help you in the renegotiation with Airwave? Obviously, you're negotiating with the home office and the CMA. I presume about a revised contract extension, but is this a negotiating point in that negotiation? How do you see it?\nGreg Brown: Yes. I think just to remind you, look, the CMA investigation was undertaken with two tenants. One is our returns on Airwave and the evaluation of that. And secondarily, the apparent potential structural dual role of us being both in Airwave and ESN, we talked about the decision working with the customer to exit ESN earlier than the expiration of 2024. I think the Airwave return issue obviously remains on the table. And while it's related to ESN, it's separate. Now having said that, around the provisional decision that came out more recently, we disagree with the CMA's provisional decision and their findings, we still are convicted in our position. I think we feel the CMA's provisional decision is legally and economically flawed. I think it's not proportional. It's unprecedented and overreaching. That said, we continue to stay in close conversation with the CMA and with the UK home office. It's kind of also ironic that as we are in the middle of this on Airwave, we coincidentally had the highest customer satisfaction score we've ever had for network performance of Airwave in the month of September, which included and incorporated all the planning around the Queen's funeral. So look, we'll continue to work it, and we will defend our position and pursue all legal avenues that are available to us, including appeals, if we think that's the right thing to do.\nGeorge Notter: Got it, okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Lapinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErik Lapinski: Hi, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to go back a little bit to the supply chain piece and just to make sure I fully understand some of the dynamics. It sounds like maybe things haven't really improved, but you did see a pretty good ramp in hardware sales during the quarter and maybe you're able to at least get supply but at a higher price. So maybe if you could just give us a bit of an update on exactly kind of where you feel like we are in the supply environment. And then as we think about that in the context of backlog, just trying to understand a little bit better, we just hardware backlog ramped a lot. Was that due to supply constraints? Is that due to just a factor of kind of the growth you're seeing in shipping times? And just maybe some more details there would be really helpful. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Yes. Sure. I think we'll tag team this. But as I mentioned, I think the semiconductor supply constraints remain. Now there's a lot that's been said and written about softening demand and we're heading towards a recession, laptops, smartphones and PCs, that doesn't apply to us. The more legacy silicon and semiconductor supply that we embed into our solutions is more analogous to the automotive industry. And as you've seen there, the automotive industry continues to be supply constrained. So we don't see a lot of relief. The progress we're making in satisfying this record demand is the decision to carry higher inventory to meet this record demand, pay more in PPV premiums, we had said we thought we'd spend $120 million for the full year. Jason just referenced, we're going to spend $150 million, that incremental $30 million is paying PPV premiums to satisfy demand. And the third leg of the stool is product redesign. So I think the environment on supply is on the margins very slightly better but still challenging and stiff for us. We're doing the inventory, higher inventory, increased PPV spend and continued product redesign I've referenced in earlier calls to satisfy this record demand.\nJason Winkler: I would add, Greg, that on the automotive front, most of the LMR componentry that we are looking to get is in 40 nanometers and greater that supports what's going on in automotive and heavy industry. And we\u2019re having success in getting what we need. The $30 million incremental is not only a good business decision, it also aligns to customer prioritization and us needing to fulfill backlog that customers have been waiting for. So in particular, this quarter in Q3 and again in Q4, we anticipate strong PCR shipments where we\u2019re getting to parts of the portfolio that had been delayed in getting componentry for. So PCR, for example, this year, while we thought it could grow here or would grow with constraints of 15% last quarter for the year. We now anticipate it\u2019s going to grow 20%. So we\u2019re getting access to the components necessary to unlock some of that PCR backlog as an example.\nGreg Brown: By the way, it also has helped the higher inventory decisions, has also helped in video security and access control as well. We now expect that growth annually to be 25% for this year, up from 20%. And the higher inventory has afforded us a position to take some incremental share both in video and PCR because of the available product.\nJason Winkler: It can be a competitive advantage in this market for sure.\nErik Lapinski: Awesome. Thanks, guys. Well, congrats on the execution.\nJason Winkler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nRyan Cui: Hi. This is Ryan Cui on for Sami. Thanks for taking the question. So I have two questions. First is, can you remind us how many round of price increase have been done so far? And is there another round of price increase should we like expected considering the alike inflation level of tax.\nJason Winkler: So our results for the year are going to be driven by both volume and price. The second half of this year will be even more supported by price because many of the actions we put into place earlier in the year have begun to impact the second half as we churn through prior backlog. So we\u2019ve done a variety of value-based pricing across the portfolio. They\u2019re helping enable as we expected, our growth and our results in the second half. We\u2019ll continue to look at that, Jack and team around the near $800 million of R&D that we spend per year does differentiate our solutions and the work the team is doing on pricing to price to value.\nRyan Cui: Got you. I appreciate that. If I can squeeze in another one. So are you seeing any like signs of like potential slowdown, especially in the EU market considering the broad like concern from macroeconomic risk?\nGreg Brown: We\u2019re not seeing that. I think that the Q3 print, I think, speaks for itself. And again, I can\u2019t thank the people across Motorola Solutions enough. I think the execution and focus has been superb. And there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, right? The historical pressure on the dollar, continued supply challenges, a lot of moving parts, but we\u2019re not. And also further reinforced by ending the quarter with record Q3 backlog, so I think demand remains strong.\nJason Winkler: Right, just to piggyback on that, when you really \u2013 when you think about our business outside of public safety, our next biggest vertical is education, which obviously given the initiatives around safe schools, around access control, analytics, that\u2019s been a hot market and there\u2019s not only funding through the American Rescue Plan, there\u2019s also funding being pointed at that through the Bipartisan Safe Cities Act, which directly addresses access, egress, ingress issues at schools.\nRyan Cui: Got you. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We now turn to Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thank you. I wanted to, Greg, return to the ESN conversation on the exit. I think a lot of investors view that as kind of the hedge to Airwave potentially going away at some point, kind of like having both LTE and LMR, so I wanted to understand why the strategic business decision to exit given it seemed like a hedge that you had? And then what does that mean for ESN? Is that network retired? Does it change hands? What becomes the Airwave alternative after this? And Jason, if you can talk about $65 million \u2013 go ahead, Greg. I don\u2019t mean to throw too much out there.\nGreg Brown: No, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, keep going on. We want to get everything to the other. Go ahead. I\u2019m sorry.\nAdam Tindle: I was just going to sneak in for Jason. He said $65 million of revenue, but my understanding was this wasn\u2019t the highest profitability. So I just wanted to understand the profitability impact of this.\nGreg Brown: Yes. On the first question, I don\u2019t think we ever looked at ESN as a hedge. We were asked way back when to bid on it. We did. I think we\u2019ve fulfilled our deliverables. We\u2019ve been fully committed to this project. And we\u2019ve worked closely with the customer. And again, what I said, they\u2019re \u2013 obviously, they\u2019re interrelated Airwave and ESN. They\u2019re the same customer and ESN has plans to be a certain network by the UK home office. But I never viewed ESN as a hedge. I viewed it as building a lot to from MSI and delivering on the expectations they had for us. As the discussions advance this year and more recently in the past quarter, I think there\u2019s a mutual agreement. It\u2019s the right thing to do to exit. Now the original contract, it was expiring at the end of 2024 anyway. So I think we both felt it was the right thing to do. As Jason said $65 million of revenue about this year and goes to zero in 2024. And for next year, it\u2019s obviously less than $65 million, but that has to be worked out in a final agreement with transition terms that predicate exactly what that looks like for next year.\nJason Winkler: And in terms of margin, you\u2019re right; it\u2019s lower than the rest of S&S. You think of it as a custom integration project in addition to us supplying them to MCPTT. So it\u2019s an integration like margin profile on that $65 million.\nGreg Brown: And Adam, I\u2019d point to you to the U.S. where we are a subcontractor to AT&T for all things FirstNet, which is a 4G now evolving to 5G, high-speed LTE network, and we participate in that. And at the same time, we continue to grow and build LMR here domestically in the states. And in fact, we see record demand for LMR here in the U.S., while simultaneously participating in FirstNet. So I don\u2019t see it as a hedge, and I don\u2019t see it as a trade-off per se.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. Okay. And then the other subject, I wanted to talk about the price cost equation in your business model. I mean we can debate when the $150 million of cost comes out of the model from a timing perspective, but I think we can all agree that\u2019s probably not permanent. It\u2019s going to come out at some point. And I\u2019m wondering when that happens, what\u2019s your intention with price at that point? You\u2019ve implemented all these price increases. Would there be a need to reduce price at that point? Or do you think price sticks $150 million comes out and we might be looking at a structurally different level of margin in your business?\nJason Winkler: We view the price increases on our products as stickier than the $150 million of temporary market conditions that really are driven by brokers and third-parties extracting maximum value in a scarce commodity play right now. So we\u2019ve had good success in looking through the portfolio and engaging with our customers, and we\u2019ll continue to procure the parts that we need to at the parts \u2013 at the prices that are market driven right now. But as we look forward, there\u2019s opportunity there.\nGreg Brown: Yes. The other thing I would remind you, when you think about 2023 is, as we said, we expect inventory to remain at elevated levels well into 2023. And second, we\u2019ve prioritized public safety shipments this year, so we have some lower tier PCR sitting in backlog that will have to flush through in Q4 and also into next year being a little bit of a counterweight to just a peel off of that $150 million.\nAdam Tindle: Is there a simple way to think about the price spend? I mean the $150 million is really easy for us to understand. Is there a way to think of price was x dollars in 2022 and an incremental x dollars in 2023? Or is it just too complicated to do that?\nGreg Brown: No, I would say this. For 2022, the growth we\u2019ve had is both volume and price. Year-to-date, for the full year, Adam, we expect the growth to be volume and price increases, but with volumes still being a little bit more than half, it would be maybe appropriate to dimensionalize some further thoughts around pricing in February, but that\u2019s the best we could give you at this point in time.\nAdam Tindle: Understood. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: We now turn to Fahad Najam from Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nFahad Najam: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you first the fuller clarification. Also, your S&S backlog, how much of it is from ESN? Is that about $100 million?\nJason Winkler: $99 million of contract value was reduced. So that\u2019s a reduction in backlog. Yes.\nFahad Najam: Okay. So that\u2019s the entirety of the ESN backlog you were carrying in the S&S. There\u2019s no additional related projects from that, right, in that $99 million.\nJason Winkler: That\u2019s right. Yes, the decision to exit the ESN contract as most probable reduced our backlog by $99 million for future contracts as well as we had a non-cash charge of $147 million off the balance sheet, corresponding to our project and the delivery. Those are the two numbers that I think are most relevant to financially what we\u2019ve decided is the most likely outcome.\nFahad Najam: Got it. Thank you. Now to my questions. Greg, in terms of how much of your revenue you\u2019re being benefited from stimulus funds? Are you still expecting the majority of funds to show up next year? Just kind of take us through how you\u2019re thinking about calendar 2023. I appreciate the initial outlook, you said with us. But maybe if you could double click maybe what\u2019s driving that?\nGreg Brown: Sure. So it\u2019s always important to probably take it back and point out that what we do, it\u2019s a need to have and not a nice to have. But with that said, we\u2019ve got $200 million year-to-date through Q3 in revenue that\u2019s tied in some way to the American Rescue Plan. The bigger thing to point to is this is a multiyear phenomenon, the ARP funds run through 2024 in all likelihood, some element of that will be extended as well.\nJason Winkler: I think it\u2019s actually $200 million year-to-date quarter.\nGreg Brown: You\u2019re right. Yes. Good clarification.\nFahad Najam: All right. Appreciate the answers. Thank you.\nJason Winkler: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We now turn to Paul Chung from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPaul Chung: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So you mentioned you feel comfortable with that $9.5 billion in 2023 initially. Can you kind of expand on the pace of growth you expect between segments? Can we still see that 20% type growth and video and as we start to think about gross margins for next year, can you kind of quantify the uplift, we should kind of expect it? Hopefully you start to see some component pricing come down and supply chain costs also come down?\nGreg Brown: Yes. I think Paul; the color I'm giving in the $9.5 billion is really that, it meant to be more directional than specific. I think we will reserve the individual specifics around segments and technologies when we have the next earnings call in February. I would say though, it has been our ongoing goal and history from a margin standpoint anyway and I'd say operating margins that aspirationally we would look to expand operating margins again in 2023, but we want to see the Q4 print, the disposition of the backlog that will inform us better on the specifics in February around more detail from a segment and technology view.\nPaul Chung: Got it. Appreciate that. And then to follow-up on free cash flow guide that kind of implies a record ramp here in 4Q. What are some risks here across working cap to hitting that guide and your visibility into cast flows and are you starting to see some component pricing even a bit helping in 2023? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Our Q4 cash flow call is supported by almost $900 million of higher sales in the second half; tremendous AR opportunity. We've had better linearity we did in Q3 and we'll have it again in Q4 anticipate so around getting products out the door sooner in the quarter such that they can turn to cash within the quarter, we call it quick turn. And then of course we are anticipating lower payments and slightly lower inventory to end the year. Half of our current elevated $1.157 billion inventory level, so we anticipate we had a good Q3 operating cash flow and we anticipate having another very good Q4 in getting to the 1,775 [ph] that we talked about during my portion of the call.\nPaul Chung: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Housum: Good afternoon guys, I appreciate it. Greg, you talk mentioned that the Airwave perhaps the appeals process, can you provide little color about what options actually Motorola will have if the CMA does is successful coming through with this proposal, adjustments for the Airwave?\nGreg Brown: Yes. Thank you Keith. Again decision that came out was provisional. We don't expect a final decision until early next year. To your question, it's worth mentioning that after a final decision there is then a remedy implementation phase that actually takes a few more months to sort out what the final ruling is in terms of how to implement. I think, I think statutorily that has to be done no later than I think it's nine or 10 months after the final decision. So that takes time to do that. I told you that we are convicted in our position and while we are obviously going to continue to work with the CMA and the customer. We think the founding's in the provisional are unfounded and overreaching and unprecedented. By the way it's worth also mentioning there is a notation in the actual provisional decision that includes an potential invitation for the home office and us to agree to a different arrangement than what the CMA has proposed. That's explicit and referenced embedded in the provisional. We would certainly be open to that conversation, and so we'll see how things develop, but there's several more months to go here.\nKeith Housum: Appreciate it. And then I'm going to actually get \u2013 I'll ask a different question from my follow-up if I could. The video surveillance going from 20% to 25% growth for the year, I goes could you guess by a bit of color about some of that strength there? Obviously it's been notable that some of your Chinese competitors are getting some more challenges, I guess, for lack of a better word around the country \u2013 around the world. Is that contributing to that growth?\nGreg Brown: I think you were clipping in and out, but I think that the direction of your question is the kind of the inertia against some Chinese suppliers adding to our growth this year? I think the answer is yes, but actually it's kind of measured because remember under the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act at the fed level it prohibits future procurement from Huawei, Hytera, Hikvision, Dahua, ZTE it is not a rip and replace. So I don't think there's the pop the clutch moment of big growth there, which is the same thing in terms of the NDAA provision around grant money. The other positive move that could help as a potential tailwind kind of circumstantially will be the Secure Equipment Act at the FCC level, which by the way could be as early as November, but it also could take more time. But if the FCC follows along the lines or contours of the NDAA, that could potentially prohibit in the case of LMR, Hytera procurement. And in the case of video security Hikvision and Dahua future procurement for the enterprise, that would be favorable. So clearly it\u2019s a favorable trend, but \u2013 and I think it's a contributor but I don't think it's an overwhelming driver to the results we're printing to date.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Keith.\nOperator: My final question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. Education, you highlighted great on your comments, which is great to hear. Can you give us a little bit of insights about like percent of sales now versus an importantly outlook? It seems like that's a growing area. I mean, just recently our school PTA had a meeting talking about the situation of putting in technology and I actually recommended your type of products and \u2013 but it's a long discussion. And so can you talk about kind of the timeline there of what you're seeing? And the profitability, I assume continues to increase as certain other school districts start to seed solutions to other school districts. And it kind of starts to self market itself at some point, but the initial kickoff seems pretty hard? Thank you so much.\nGreg Brown: Jim, you nailed it. It is a game of inertia, but just to di-mensionalize it, think of it as around 25% of our fixed video security and access control business. The one thing that we've been very thoughtful around the investments we've made not only organically, it started with the Avigilon and the investments we've made organically there, but the acquisitions by way of Ava and Openpath because what we're seeing, and as you pointed out, larger school districts may want an on-prem solution, and a lot of the money that are being directed now are actually at a private and smaller schools, and they might want a cloud-based solution. So we feel like we've got \u2013 obviously we've got the ability to meet the customers depending on their needs for where they are. In terms of growth rate, you've seen the print we have 33% growth. Education is growing in that category so it's roughly a quarter of our fixed video security business growing approximately 30% this year.\nJason Winkler: And this is also an area of investment as we further integrate all of our portfolio in and around Safer Schools. Mahesh, maybe you could talk about some of the things we're doing to integrate the portfolio, so to better position our portfolio to keep schools safe.\nMahesh Saptharishi: Introduced this program called Safety Reimagined not just long ago; and a key element \u2013 a technology element of Safety Reimagined was a solution called Orchestrate and one of the things that Orchestrate enables us to do is to really coordinate the detection capabilities of our AI enabled fixed cameras to actions that are possible within the school, including notifications to radios as well and all of this enables effective public private partnership even during a response timeframe. So when you put it all together it actually takes advantage of the entirety of the Motorola Solutions portfolio, and we are uniquely positioned to go in and solve specific problems for schools.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for the details and congratulations.\nGreg Brown: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll not turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks.\nGreg Brown: Thank you very much. I appreciate everybody joining us Thursday afternoon. Look, I just want to summarize and just say thank you to everybody. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, significant FX headwinds increasing inflation and the fed raising interest rates, despite all of that we continue to grow. We continue to grow based on volume and some pricing power. We're raising expectations on top and bottom for the full year. We've delivered on capital allocation strategy year-to-date investing more than $1.3 billion, but most importantly we continue to meet the needs of our customers. I mean, the environment is strong, exceptionally strong, strong funding, record orders, record backlog and while we're really proud of the Print, I'm also equally proud of that we're printing these results while still investing in the business and in the portfolio to differentiate ourselves accordingly. Like our position heading into 2023 and I am deeply grateful and thankful to everybody at Motorola Solutions. A hell of a quarter and by the way particularly all of those you \u2013 of you in Florida, the systems integration team, the services team during Hurricane Ian the strength of our LMR networks shown through but even more importantly the courage and the pride of our people showed through two time and time again. I'm grateful and I'm proud of you. Thanks for joining us, and we'll talk to you again in a few months.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the internet within two hours. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 13% and was above our guidance with record third quarter revenue in both segments. We also saw growth across all three technologies led by 33% growth in video security and access control. In LMR, which grew 9%, our supply chain execution during the quarter enabled us to ship additional product revenue. FX headwinds during the quarter were $66 million, while acquisitions added $32 million. GAAP operating earnings were $373 million inclusive of $147 million non-cash fixed asset impairment charge recognized during the quarter related to the now planned exit from the ESN contract. GAAP operating margins were 15.7%. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $676 million, up 22% from the year ago quarter. And non-GAAP operating margin was 28.5%, up from 26.3%. This increase in operating margin was driven by higher sales, higher gross margins, and improved operating leverage, particularly in the Products and SI segment. GAAP earnings per share were a $1.63 compared to a $1.76 per share in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the impairment charge related to the expected early exit of the ESN contract. Non-GAAP EPS was $3 per share, up 28% from $2.35 last year. This strong growth in EPS was driven by higher sales in margins, as well as a lower affected tax rate related to higher benefits from stock comp recognized in the current year. OpEx in Q3 was $521 million up $25 million versus last year, primarily due to acquisitions. Turning to cash flow Q3 operating cash flow was $388 million, up $12 million compared with the prior year. And free cash flow was $318 million up $3 million. For the full year we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $100 million lower than our prior guidance, primarily due to our continued investment in inventory, which is helping us execute in a dynamic supply chain environment and deliver against the continued record demand we're seeing in video security and LMR. Capital allocation for Q3 included $132 million in cash dividends, $94 million in share repurchases and $70 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Barrett Communications, a specialty supplier of high frequency and tactical communications equipment for $18 million net of cash. Moving to segment results in the Products and SI segment, we continue to see strong demand across both LMR and video. Sales during the quarter, were up 15% versus last year and orders were up 29%, including record Q3 orders for both LMR and video. Currency headwinds were $28 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter contributed $13 million. Operating earnings were $375 million or 24.5% of sales up from 20.6% in the prior year, driven primarily by higher sales and operating leverage, partially offset by higher material costs. The impact from our pricing actions increased in Q3 as expected, and we continue to expect full year operating margins in this segment to be higher than last year. Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in the segment include an order in Israel valued at over $400 million for a duration of 25 years. This unique system integration project also includes over $30 million of fixed video equipment and software, and is our single largest order ever for Avigilon.  $165 million P25 System and APX NEXT devices award received from Miami-Dade County that includes a new customer for us in the state of Florida; a $67 million P25 order from Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority; a $45 million P25 order from a customer in Africa; a $29 million P25 devices order from a U.S. federal customer, an $18 million TETRA order from a customer in Europe, and a $5 million fixed video order from a major transportation company in North Africa.  In Software and Services revenue was up 8%, which includes $38 million of FX headwinds and $19 million of revenue from acquisitions. Total software revenue was up 17% driven by strong demand in video, while in LMR services revenue was up 4% after $33 million of FX headwinds. Operating earnings in the segment were $301 million or 35.7% of sales, down 30 basis points from last year driven by higher acquisition expenses. Some notable Q3 highlights in the segment include two large multi-year LMR service renewals, a $43 million won with the State of Maryland and $15 million with the City of Phoenix. Also, a $17 million push-to-talk over broadband order from a customer in the Middle East, a $7 million command center software renewal with Will County, Illinois, a $4 million body-worn camera order for the Texas Department of Public Safety, and a $4 million command center software suite order for Ellis County, Texas. Looking at regional results, North America Q3 revenue was $1.7 billion, up 16% on growth in all three technologies. International Q3 revenue was $686 million, up 4% versus last year with growth in all three technologies, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Moving to our backlog, ending backlog was a Q3 record of $13.5 billion, up 19% or $2.1 billion compared to last year, inclusive of approximately $826 million of unfavorable FX and a $99 million orders reduction related to the planned exit from the ESN contract. The growth was driven by the Airwave extension recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021, and increased demand across all three technologies. Sequentially backlog was up $87 million driven by several large orders received during the quarter, partially offset by $411 million of unfavorable FX and the $99 million adjustment for ESN. In the Products and SI segment, robust order demand in both LMR and video continues to drive record backlog, which was up $1.2 billion or 35% compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $513 million, which was our ninth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth in this segment. In Software and Services backlog was up $876 million compared to last year, driven by the Airwave extension and a $288 million increase in multi-year services and software contracts in North America, partially offset by $722 million of unfavorable FX and the adjustment related to ESN. So sequentially backlog was down $426 million or 5% driven primarily by unfavorable FX, the ESN adjustment and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN during the quarter. Turning now to our outlook, we expect Q4 sales to be up approximately 9% with non-GAAP earnings per share, between $3.40 and $3.45 per share. This assumes $90 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. For the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance again. We now expect revenue growth between 9.25% and 9.5% up from our prior guidance of 8%. And we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $10.17 and $10.22 per share, up from our prior guidance of $10.03 to $10.13 per share. This updated guidance now includes full year FX headwinds of $220 million, up $50 million from our prior guidance, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 20.5%. This now also assumes $150 million of higher costs for the full year related to the procurement of semiconductors from secondary markets at a premium. This is a $30 million increase over what we indicated earlier in the year and supports the increased revenue included in our updated guidance today. And finally, as I reflect on where we stand today with just two months left in another dynamic year, I'm encouraged with how our teams have been navigating the supply chain environment and overcoming the impact of a historically strong U.S. dollar. At the beginning of the year, we expected currency headwinds to have a $60 million translation impact on our full year revenues. The full year FX headwind has increased by $160 million since then. The decisions we've made to carry higher inventory pay premiums for semiconductors and the pricing actions we implemented have enabled us to drive higher product revenues that not only offset these significant FX headwinds and but have materially increased our revenue and EPS expectations during the year. I'll now turn the call back over to Greg. Lisa, if I could also add color to your question around ESN. So the revenues this year for ESN are going to be approximately $65 million. That includes some of the MCPTT as well as the integration and the project. As Greg mentioned, with the exit of the contract, that will go to zero in 2024. We're working through as part of the negotiation, what transition services and what that looks like in terms of revenue for next year. So we'll update you on that as it concludes. But $65 million in this year's top line results from ESN. I would add, Greg, that on the automotive front, most of the LMR componentry that we are looking to get is in 40 nanometers and greater that supports what's going on in automotive and heavy industry. And we're having success in getting what we need. The $30 million incremental is not only a good business decision, it also aligns to customer prioritization and us needing to fulfill backlog that customers have been waiting for. So in particular, this quarter in Q3 and again in Q4, we anticipate strong PCR shipments where we're getting to parts of the portfolio that had been delayed in getting componentry for. So PCR, for example, this year, while we thought it could grow here or would grow with constraints of 15% last quarter for the year. We now anticipate it's going to grow 20%. So we're getting access to the components necessary to unlock some of that PCR backlog as an example. It can be a competitive advantage in this market for sure. Thank you. So our results for the year are going to be driven by both volume and price. The second half of this year will be even more supported by price because many of the actions we put into place earlier in the year have begun to impact the second half as we churn through prior backlog. So we've done a variety of value-based pricing across the portfolio. They're helping enable as we expected, our growth and our results in the second half. We'll continue to look at that, Jack and team around the near $800 million of R&D that we spend per year does differentiate our solutions and the work the team is doing on pricing to price to value. Right, just to piggyback on that, when you really \u2013 when you think about our business outside of public safety, our next biggest vertical is education, which obviously given the initiatives around safe schools, around access control, analytics, that's been a hot market and there's not only funding through the American Rescue Plan, there's also funding being pointed at that through the Bipartisan Safe Cities Act, which directly addresses access, egress, ingress issues at schools. And in terms of margin, you're right; it's lower than the rest of S&S. You think of it as a custom integration project in addition to us supplying them to MCPTT. So it's an integration like margin profile on that $65 million. We view the price increases on our products as stickier than the $150 million of temporary market conditions that really are driven by brokers and third-parties extracting maximum value in a scarce commodity play right now. So we've had good success in looking through the portfolio and engaging with our customers, and we'll continue to procure the parts that we need to at the parts \u2013 at the prices that are market driven right now. But as we look forward, there's opportunity there. $99 million of contract value was reduced. So that's a reduction in backlog. Yes. That's right. Yes, the decision to exit the ESN contract as most probable reduced our backlog by $99 million for future contracts as well as we had a non-cash charge of $147 million off the balance sheet, corresponding to our project and the delivery. Those are the two numbers that I think are most relevant to financially what we've decided is the most likely outcome. I think it's actually $200 million year-to-date quarter. Thank you. And this is also an area of investment as we further integrate all of our portfolio in and around Safer Schools. Mahesh, maybe you could talk about some of the things we're doing to integrate the portfolio, so to better position our portfolio to keep schools safe."

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim. And good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. First, our Q3 results highlight the continued strong demand and robust funding environment that we're seeing across the business. We grew revenue 13%, EPS 28%, and expanded operating margins by 220 basis points. Additionally, we ended the quarter with record Q3 ending backlog of $13.5 billion, up 19% from last year, inclusive of over $800 million of unfavorable currency impact. Second, we achieved record Q3 revenue in both segments in Products and Systems Integration, increased demand for video security and land mobile radio technologies and continued solid execution in our supply chain led to revenue growth of 15% during the quarter. And in Software and Services revenue was up 8% and 13% when normalized for FX. And finally, based on our exceptionally strong Q3 results and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS for the second consecutive time, despite full year FX headwinds that now total about $220 million up $50 million from our expectations last quarter. So at this point, I will now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thanks, Jason. I'm really pleased with our Q3 results, and I'm extremely proud of the people here at Motorola and how our team continues to execute across all areas of the business. We achieved record Q3 sales in both segments, EPS is up by 28%. We expanded operating margins by 220 basis points, and we ended the quarter with a record ending backlog of $13.5 billion, up 19%. And again, that's in the face of some significant FX headwinds. Second, we continue to deliver these strong results while also continuing to invest in both new products and strengthening our ecosystem. During the quarter, we extended our successful APX NEXT device portfolio with three additional radios that support agencies of all sizes, personnel needs and budgets. We announced several new video integrations into CommandCentral Aware, bringing body-worn in car and emergency drone video feeds into the command center and we expanded our suite of cloud-connected cameras with the Ava Quad, a cloud-native forehead camera with built-in analytics. And finally, as I look ahead, the momentum of our business is strong. Our investments in the portfolio, combined with a robust funding environment are driving increased demand for our solutions, our supply chain execution and higher inventory is helping us navigate a continually challenging environment to meet this record demand and our record Q3 backlog positions us well for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth into 2023. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim, and we'll open it up for your questions. Yes, in terms of ESN, Lisa, I think it's a result of ongoing conversations with the customer. I think more recently, they reached an advanced stage, kind of a late-stage negotiation where at this point, we think it's more likely than not that we will be exiting ESN earlier than the expiration of 2024. We don't have an agreement signed with them at this point. But I think there's mutual interest in reaching that conclusion and we continue to work toward that end. So I think we both think it's the right thing to do and a reasonable way forward. Look, in terms of 2023, and I know we have a lot of good news for the Q3 print. It's a little bit \u2013 a little bit early to think about. There's still a lot of moving parts. I think at this point in time, we think about revenue of about $9.5 billion in 2023. We expect at that level, we could grow within all three technologies. But it's also worth noting that there's still some things that we'll be dealing with into 2023. I think that the supply chain constraints around semiconductor, which we're still experiencing, which is one example of why Jason referenced, we're carrying higher inventory purposely and carrying and paying more higher PPV premiums. But I think that those semiconductor supply chain challenges continue into next year and therefore, I think our higher inventory levels will continue well into 2023. I also think, again, at the moment, we have FX headwinds that look about $150 million, of which, by the way, more than half of that would be actually in Q1 alone. And then one other just thing to think about for all of us in terms of 2023 is we expect about 200 to 300 basis points of higher tax rate headwinds in 2023 that will inform our thinking. But those are high-level chalk to field thoughts at this moment, and we would \u2013 we'll obviously give you the specifics in February. Thanks Lisa. Yes. I think just to remind you, look, the CMA investigation was undertaken with two tenants. One is our returns on Airwave and the evaluation of that. And secondarily, the apparent potential structural dual role of us being both in Airwave and ESN, we talked about the decision working with the customer to exit ESN earlier than the expiration of 2024. I think the Airwave return issue obviously remains on the table. And while it's related to ESN, it's separate. Now having said that, around the provisional decision that came out more recently, we disagree with the CMA's provisional decision and their findings, we still are convicted in our position. I think we feel the CMA's provisional decision is legally and economically flawed. I think it's not proportional. It's unprecedented and overreaching. That said, we continue to stay in close conversation with the CMA and with the UK home office. It's kind of also ironic that as we are in the middle of this on Airwave, we coincidentally had the highest customer satisfaction score we've ever had for network performance of Airwave in the month of September, which included and incorporated all the planning around the Queen's funeral. So look, we'll continue to work it, and we will defend our position and pursue all legal avenues that are available to us, including appeals, if we think that's the right thing to do. Yes. Sure. I think we'll tag team this. But as I mentioned, I think the semiconductor supply constraints remain. Now there's a lot that's been said and written about softening demand and we're heading towards a recession, laptops, smartphones and PCs, that doesn't apply to us. The more legacy silicon and semiconductor supply that we embed into our solutions is more analogous to the automotive industry. And as you've seen there, the automotive industry continues to be supply constrained. So we don't see a lot of relief. The progress we're making in satisfying this record demand is the decision to carry higher inventory to meet this record demand, pay more in PPV premiums, we had said we thought we'd spend $120 million for the full year. Jason just referenced, we're going to spend $150 million, that incremental $30 million is paying PPV premiums to satisfy demand. And the third leg of the stool is product redesign. So I think the environment on supply is on the margins very slightly better but still challenging and stiff for us. We're doing the inventory, higher inventory, increased PPV spend and continued product redesign I've referenced in earlier calls to satisfy this record demand. By the way, it also has helped the higher inventory decisions, has also helped in video security and access control as well. We now expect that growth annually to be 25% for this year, up from 20%. And the higher inventory has afforded us a position to take some incremental share both in video and PCR because of the available product. We're not seeing that. I think that the Q3 print, I think, speaks for itself. And again, I can't thank the people across Motorola Solutions enough. I think the execution and focus has been superb. And there's a lot of moving parts, right? The historical pressure on the dollar, continued supply challenges, a lot of moving parts, but we're not. And also further reinforced by ending the quarter with record Q3 backlog, so I think demand remains strong. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, keep going on. We want to get everything to the other. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Yes. On the first question, I don't think we ever looked at ESN as a hedge. We were asked way back when to bid on it. We did. I think we've fulfilled our deliverables. We've been fully committed to this project. And we've worked closely with the customer. And again, what I said, they're \u2013 obviously, they're interrelated Airwave and ESN. They're the same customer and ESN has plans to be a certain network by the UK home office. But I never viewed ESN as a hedge. I viewed it as building a lot to from MSI and delivering on the expectations they had for us. As the discussions advance this year and more recently in the past quarter, I think there's a mutual agreement. It's the right thing to do to exit. Now the original contract, it was expiring at the end of 2024 anyway. So I think we both felt it was the right thing to do. As Jason said $65 million of revenue about this year and goes to zero in 2024. And for next year, it's obviously less than $65 million, but that has to be worked out in a final agreement with transition terms that predicate exactly what that looks like for next year. And Adam, I'd point to you to the U.S. where we are a subcontractor to AT&T for all things FirstNet, which is a 4G now evolving to 5G, high-speed LTE network, and we participate in that. And at the same time, we continue to grow and build LMR here domestically in the states. And in fact, we see record demand for LMR here in the U.S., while simultaneously participating in FirstNet. So I don't see it as a hedge, and I don't see it as a trade-off per se. Yes. The other thing I would remind you, when you think about 2023 is, as we said, we expect inventory to remain at elevated levels well into 2023. And second, we've prioritized public safety shipments this year, so we have some lower tier PCR sitting in backlog that will have to flush through in Q4 and also into next year being a little bit of a counterweight to just a peel off of that $150 million. No, I would say this. For 2022, the growth we've had is both volume and price. Year-to-date, for the full year, Adam, we expect the growth to be volume and price increases, but with volumes still being a little bit more than half, it would be maybe appropriate to dimensionalize some further thoughts around pricing in February, but that's the best we could give you at this point in time. Thanks, Adam. Sure. So it's always important to probably take it back and point out that what we do, it's a need to have and not a nice to have. But with that said, we've got $200 million year-to-date through Q3 in revenue that's tied in some way to the American Rescue Plan. The bigger thing to point to is this is a multiyear phenomenon, the ARP funds run through 2024 in all likelihood, some element of that will be extended as well. You're right. Yes. Good clarification. Yes. I think Paul; the color I'm giving in the $9.5 billion is really that, it meant to be more directional than specific. I think we will reserve the individual specifics around segments and technologies when we have the next earnings call in February. I would say though, it has been our ongoing goal and history from a margin standpoint anyway and I'd say operating margins that aspirationally we would look to expand operating margins again in 2023, but we want to see the Q4 print, the disposition of the backlog that will inform us better on the specifics in February around more detail from a segment and technology view. Our Q4 cash flow call is supported by almost $900 million of higher sales in the second half; tremendous AR opportunity. We've had better linearity we did in Q3 and we'll have it again in Q4 anticipate so around getting products out the door sooner in the quarter such that they can turn to cash within the quarter, we call it quick turn. And then of course we are anticipating lower payments and slightly lower inventory to end the year. Half of our current elevated $1.157 billion inventory level, so we anticipate we had a good Q3 operating cash flow and we anticipate having another very good Q4 in getting to the 1,775 [ph] that we talked about during my portion of the call. Thank you. Yes. Thank you Keith. Again decision that came out was provisional. We don't expect a final decision until early next year. To your question, it's worth mentioning that after a final decision there is then a remedy implementation phase that actually takes a few more months to sort out what the final ruling is in terms of how to implement. I think, I think statutorily that has to be done no later than I think it's nine or 10 months after the final decision. So that takes time to do that. I told you that we are convicted in our position and while we are obviously going to continue to work with the CMA and the customer. We think the founding's in the provisional are unfounded and overreaching and unprecedented. By the way it's worth also mentioning there is a notation in the actual provisional decision that includes an potential invitation for the home office and us to agree to a different arrangement than what the CMA has proposed. That's explicit and referenced embedded in the provisional. We would certainly be open to that conversation, and so we'll see how things develop, but there's several more months to go here. I think you were clipping in and out, but I think that the direction of your question is the kind of the inertia against some Chinese suppliers adding to our growth this year? I think the answer is yes, but actually it's kind of measured because remember under the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act at the fed level it prohibits future procurement from Huawei, Hytera, Hikvision, Dahua, ZTE it is not a rip and replace. So I don't think there's the pop the clutch moment of big growth there, which is the same thing in terms of the NDAA provision around grant money. The other positive move that could help as a potential tailwind kind of circumstantially will be the Secure Equipment Act at the FCC level, which by the way could be as early as November, but it also could take more time. But if the FCC follows along the lines or contours of the NDAA, that could potentially prohibit in the case of LMR, Hytera procurement. And in the case of video security Hikvision and Dahua future procurement for the enterprise, that would be favorable. So clearly it's a favorable trend, but \u2013 and I think it's a contributor but I don't think it's an overwhelming driver to the results we're printing to date. Thanks, Keith. Jim, you nailed it. It is a game of inertia, but just to di-mensionalize it, think of it as around 25% of our fixed video security and access control business. The one thing that we've been very thoughtful around the investments we've made not only organically, it started with the Avigilon and the investments we've made organically there, but the acquisitions by way of Ava and Openpath because what we're seeing, and as you pointed out, larger school districts may want an on-prem solution, and a lot of the money that are being directed now are actually at a private and smaller schools, and they might want a cloud-based solution. So we feel like we've got \u2013 obviously we've got the ability to meet the customers depending on their needs for where they are. In terms of growth rate, you've seen the print we have 33% growth. Education is growing in that category so it's roughly a quarter of our fixed video security business growing approximately 30% this year. Thank you, Jim. Thank you very much. I appreciate everybody joining us Thursday afternoon. Look, I just want to summarize and just say thank you to everybody. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, significant FX headwinds increasing inflation and the fed raising interest rates, despite all of that we continue to grow. We continue to grow based on volume and some pricing power. We're raising expectations on top and bottom for the full year. We've delivered on capital allocation strategy year-to-date investing more than $1.3 billion, but most importantly we continue to meet the needs of our customers. I mean, the environment is strong, exceptionally strong, strong funding, record orders, record backlog and while we're really proud of the Print, I'm also equally proud of that we're printing these results while still investing in the business and in the portfolio to differentiate ourselves accordingly. Like our position heading into 2023 and I am deeply grateful and thankful to everybody at Motorola Solutions. A hell of a quarter and by the way particularly all of those you \u2013 of you in Florida, the systems integration team, the services team during Hurricane Ian the strength of our LMR networks shown through but even more importantly the courage and the pride of our people showed through two time and time again. I'm grateful and I'm proud of you. Thanks for joining us, and we'll talk to you again in a few months."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for holding. Welcome to the Motorola Solutions Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. The presentation material and additional financial tables are posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a webcast replay of this call will be available on our website within 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference.\nTim Yocum: Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2022 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.  We posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.  A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2021 annual report on Form 10-K or any quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.  I'll turn the call over to Greg.\nGregory Brown: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through the results and our outlook.  First, Q2 was exceptional across the board with revenue and earnings per share both coming in above our expectations. In Software and Services, revenue was up 11%, highlighted by strong software growth. And in Products and SI, continued record demand across both land mobile radio and video, led to 7% revenue growth and 17% orders growth, driving increased backlog.  Additionally, we ended the quarter with record Q2 backlog of $13.4 billion, up 19% versus last year, inclusive of approximately $500 million of unfavorable currency impact. Second, our portfolio and go-to-market investments are continuing to drive meaningful growth across all 3 technologies. During the quarter, revenue was up 21% in both video and command Center Software, and we saw record Q2 orders in both of those technologies as well. And in LMR, demand is growing for our high Tier P25 APX NEXT device with customers embracing its unique ability to offer the must-have reliability of LMR while seamlessly leveraging broadband features such as remote programming, network extension and location services.  And finally, based on our Q2 record ending backlog and continued strong operational execution, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share.  At this point, I'll turn it over to Jason, who will take you through our results and outlook and then return for some final thoughts.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter was up 9% and above our guidance with record second quarter revenue in both segments. We saw strong growth across all 3 technologies, led by over 20% growth in both Video and Command Center Software. In LMR, which grew 5%, we were able to secure more critical parts, particularly later in the quarter, which enabled us to ship more product.  Acquisitions during the quarter added $34 million and FX headwinds were $44 million. GAAP operating earnings were $358 million, and operating margins were 16.7%. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $497 million, up $15 million or 3% from the year ago quarter, and non-GAAP operating margins were 23.2%, down from 24.4%. The decline in operating margins was due to the higher semiconductor costs we outlined on our prior calls related to acquiring critical supply in the secondary market, together with higher freight costs and higher operating expenses related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher sales.  GAAP earnings per share was $1.33 compared to $1.69 per share in the year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit recognized in the prior year and higher direct material costs in the current year. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.07, flat versus last year. The higher sales and operating earnings generated in the current quarter were offset by the higher direct material costs I mentioned previously, along with higher operating expenses related to acquisitions.  OpEx in Q2 was $502 million, up $25 million, primarily due to acquisitions. Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $10 million compared with $388 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was a usage of $49 million compared to $326 million generated in the prior year. In Q2 and the first half of the year, our cash flow has been primarily impacted by 2 items: first, our planned investments in inventory to navigate the dynamic supply chain environment and position us to fulfill the record demand we're seeing in Video and LMR; second, higher employee incentive payments that were tied to 2021's performance and paid out this year.  We expect our cash flow conversion to accelerate in the second half, driven by higher profitability and a reduction in our current inventory levels in addition to the normal seasonality of our cash conversion. Capital allocation for Q2 included $162 million in share repurchases, $132 million in cash dividends and $59 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the video acquisitions of Calipsa for $40 million and Videotec for $22 million. We also issued $600 million of long-term debt, used a portion of the proceeds to retire $275 million, resulting in approximately $320 million of incremental debt net of fees on our balance sheet.  In the Products and SI segment, we continue to see strong demand across both LMR and video. Sales during the quarter were up 7% versus last year and orders were up 17%, including record Q2 orders for both LMR and video. Revenue from acquisitions for this segment in the quarter was $14 million and currency headwinds were $19 million. Operating earnings for Products and SI were $188 million or 14.6%, down from 16.2% of sales in the prior year, driven primarily by the higher material costs and higher freight costs previously mentioned, partially offset by higher sales.  We continue to expect full year operating margins for this segment to be slightly higher than 2021 as the impact from pricing actions accelerates in the second half. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in the segment include several large P25 orders in the U.S., including $32 million for a state of California agency, $27 million for Dutchess County, New York and $22 million order for the Georgia Department of Corrections. We also had a $26 million order for a P25 solution with LTE integration for an international customer, a $15 million TETRA order for a customer in Argentina. And finally, we received 2 large fixed video orders, a $9 million order for a customer in the health care vertical and an $8 million order for a large retail customer.  In the Software and Services segment, revenue was up 11%, with revenue from acquisitions of $20 million and currency headwinds of $25 million during the quarter. Total software revenue was up 25%, driven by strong demand in video and a large deployment in Command Center Software, while in LMR services, revenue was up 5%. Operating earnings in the segment were $309 million or 36.1% of sales, down 110 basis points from last year, driven by a change in year-over-year mix and higher M&A expenses, partially offset by higher sales.  We continue to expect segment operating margins for Software and Services for the full year to be comparable to last year, inclusive of the additional OpEx spend from our recent acquisitions. Some notable Q2 highlights in this segment include 2 large multiyear LMR service renewals, $43 million with the state of South Australia and $35 million with the state of Mississippi. We also had 3 large Command Center Softwares in the U.S. -- orders in the U.S., $35 million from a large metropolitan city, $14 million from the Los Angeles Police Department and $11 million from Frederick County, Maryland. We were also awarded an $8 million body-worn camera order from the Detroit Police Department.  Moving next to our regional results. North America Q2 revenue was $1.5 billion, up 13% on growth in all 3 technologies. International Q2 revenue was $656 million, flat versus last year, with growth in all 3 technologies, offset by unfavorable FX.  Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog was a record -- Q2 record of $13.4 billion, up 19% or $2.2 billion compared to last year, inclusive of approximately $500 million of unfavorable FX. The growth was driven by the Airwave extension recorded in the fourth quarter of '21 and increased demand across all 3 technologies. Sequentially, backlog was down $21 million, driven primarily by a $397 million movement in unfavorable FX and the quarterly revenue burn related to the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset by record Q2 orders in LMR products, video and Command Center Software.  In the Products and SI segment, continued robust order demand in both LMR and Video is driving record backlog, which was up $986 million or 30% compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $206 million, which was our eighth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth in the products segment. Additionally, our product backlog increasingly reflects new pricing, which we expect to contribute to the profitability ramp for the second half.  In Software and Services, backlog was $1.2 billion compared to last year, driven also by the Airwave extension and a $380 million increase in multiyear services and software backlog in North America. Sequentially, backlog was down $227 million or 2%, driven primarily by unfavorable FX and revenue recognition for the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset by record second quarter orders in Command Center Software.  Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 10%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.85 and $2.90 per share. This assumes approximately $60 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 20%. And for the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 8%, up from our prior guidance of 7%, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $10.03 and $10.13 per share up from our prior guide of $9.80 to $9.95 per share. This updated guidance includes FX headwinds of approximately $170 million, a diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 21.5%.  Before I turn the call back to Greg, I would like to highlight some of the priorities we are driving for the remainder of the year. First, we remain focused on supply chain execution, both tactically and strategically, including rapid redesigns by our engineering teams to substitute to available semiconductors, alternatives, strategic inventory investments that we are making, securing high-demand discrete semiconductors from brokers when necessary and entering into long-term supply agreements where possible.  Second, our pricing actions across the portfolio have been effective to date, and we'll continue to look at pricing opportunities and maintain cost discipline as we manage through a higher cost environment. And finally, we are balancing the benefits of higher inventory with cash conversion, and we'll continue to optimize our working capital and balance sheet to drive increased cash flow in the second half.  I'll now turn the call back over to Greg.\nGregory Brown: Jason, thanks. I'd like to end with a few thoughts as we conclude this call. First, I'm really pleased with what we accomplished during the quarter. We achieved Q2 record sales, including 21% growth in both video and Command Center Software. We strengthened our video portfolio with the acquisitions of Calipsa, which brings us advanced cloud native video analytics, and Videotec, which broadens our ruggedized camera portfolio to serve the critical infrastructure market.  We had record Q2 product orders at higher prices, including our single largest quarter ever for PCR orders, and we ended the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog. The pricing actions we've taken to offset higher input costs position us well for margin expansion for the back half of this year.  Second, our investments in AI and cloud continue to drive robust software growth for the company. Customers like Greenville County schools in South Carolina depend on our video security and access control solution to help keep students safe. And the city of Houston is deploying more than 3,000 body-worn cameras with cloud-based evidence management to help provide greater accountability and transparency.  And with the acquisitions such as AVA Security and Calipsa, we're well positioned to accelerate the deployment of cloud video software solutions with customers around the world. And finally, as we enter the second half of this year, I am very encouraged by our momentum. The multiyear funding environment for our customers continues to be as strong as it's ever been, our solutions for both public safety and enterprise security have never been more important. Our strong execution has allowed us to effectively navigate this dynamic environment.  And finally, the resilience of our business, our durable cash flows and our strong balance sheet provide us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in our future deployment of capital.  And now I'll turn the call back over to Tim and welcome your questions.\nTim Yocum: Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask the question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from George Notter of Jefferies.\nGeorge Notter: Congratulations on the strong results and backlog. I guess I wanted to ask about a comment you made about the funding environment. What's your perspective now on state and local government budgets? Obviously, many of those budgets began on July 1. Many of those budgets were reset looking forward. Just be curious on what your perspective is on the funding environment and how you're seeing those budgets?  And then also related to that is a question of ARPA. I'm wondering if you're seeing ARPA money right now. I think last quarter, you told us you were seeing a 3x improvement in the sales funnel. What does that look like right now? Any more detail you can provide would be great?\nJohn Molloy: Sure, George. So when you think about state and local budgets, I mean, I think, first of all, we hear us say it time and time again, what we do, what we provide is a need to have, not a nice to have. But as it relates to the inflationary environment we're dealing in, self-funding alone for states, they're in a very beneficial period of time. Because if you look at it, they derive their budgets from personal income tax, from sales tax and from corporate income tax, all of which stand the benefit to drive more money into their coffers and thereby, improve their general fund situation.  So it's that piece of it. We also look at the second rail of this, and that's the monies that are being made available through ARPA. And I would just simply say that we've talked about it, it's generally beneficial, and we think it's a general tailwind. But the most important thing is it's not a 2022 phenomenon. It's one that's multiyear.  And in fact, these won't expire until 2024, and all likelihood we know is those will likely be extended. So you've heard Greg said it. I think he said in the script, but we're in a really unique situation because we are in a good funding environment. But I think it also is timely because we're going through product refresh investments. We're seeing that here in the United States with the APX NEXT platform. And later this year, we're going to be announcing the mid-tier APX NEXT devices, which we're really excited about.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erik Lapinski of Morgan Stanley.\nErik Lapinski: Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just following up on the comment you just made on kind of LMR and the APX NEXT. Can you give us any update on just with some of the P25 deals you're seeing? What the uptake is of APX NEXT and some of those upgrades? Is it skewing towards being most? Or I guess, just legs on that cycle and how we should think about that?\nJohn Molloy: Yes. So as I've said before, we're in the early innings of the P25 upgrade cycle. I used the baseball metaphor. And our -- I believe it was our February call in second inning, I think we're largely still in that period of time. But just a couple of updates, $190 million of orders. Interestingly, we're seeing a lot of interest from non-Motorola customers, and it's not only the better basics, the ergonomics and the audio performance of the APX NEXT, but it's really the Smart Connect.  And so what our customers saw during COVID, particularly people like health departments, was the capability to expand their coverage outside of the P25 networks. It's also things like smart mapping. We think about accountability, we think about officer and firefighter safety, location is paramount to that. And then we're also looking at messaging as we have more and more young officers in the field, they need ways, different modalities like text and video and the capability to share those. That type of data and they're using the LTE collaborative aspect of the APX NEXT.  So again, really excited. But I would note that we've -- the $190 million has all been targeted at the highest tier, which is the original APX NEXT with subsequent releases in the second half of this year with the mid-tier portfolio, which we're starting to engage in customer discussions on.\nGregory Brown: And Erik, the $190 million of orders is since the APX NEXT product was introduced, but I'd also add that just, in general, Q2 was a record for P25 public safety devices, which is more broad than APX NEXT as well. So APX NEXT continues to fire away. And just to -- I think the team did a superb job in product introduction. Molloy's team has sold it, but also more broadly beyond APX NEXT, Q2 was a record for 25 public safety orders, which I'm quite happy about as well.\nErik Lapinski: Awesome. If I could sneak in another one just on Command Center Software. You had a few larger deals there to this quarter. Just in terms of progress and maybe uptake of some of the cloud-based offerings you have there, were any of those upgrades more on cloud-based? And then did any maybe expand beyond the PSAP presence you have into other capabilities?\nMahesh Saptharishi: Yes. So maybe just a quick overview. Jason mentioned 2 specific deals, LVMPD, Frederick County. If you look at both of those, LVMPD was on-premises records deal, but really a hybrid element to it, and that was the CommandCentral Responder piece, which is really driven by mobile access to records information. We're seeing more and more of that, and that hybrid element was key to that particular deal.  With Frederick, we added CommandCentral Aware in addition to PremierOne CAD. Aware is a cloud hosted a SaaS solution for us. And Aware gives the county a single plane of glass to understand where unit locations are, both from radios and also from incident information. It is as Jack said previously location information being paramount -- accurate location information being paramount in that case. We continue to invest in our hybrid strategy. We're executing on our hybrid strategy.  And a key point there is that our SaaS growth rate is actually faster than the overall Command Center Software growth rate, which itself was quite strong in this quarter. And the last thing that I'll say is we're continuing to innovate and invest in innovations. And we had 2 significant firsts this quarter. One is, we introduced the world's first public safety Carplay application, one that we developed with Western Australia Police and with Apple. And the second is along with Prince Georges County in Maryland, we won the Thomas O'Reilly Innovation Award for being the first in the country to introduce location-based routing -- NENA i3 compliant location-based routing. So together, I think we are executing well on our hybrid strategy.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: I just wanted to ask about them between calls, so hopefully it hasn't been asked. But Greg, could you maybe give us any updates on ESN and Airwave? In particular, if you could review any financial implications? I think there's significant differences in the different outcomes and probabilities based on what happens and just that might make sense to level set with investors?\nGregory Brown: Yes. I think things remain engaged and in progress, Adam, really. We are in close contact with the customer, in this case, the U.K. home office. We've maintained very close contact with the CMA and have regularly provided them with information over the last several weeks and months as we educate them on our role in both Airwave and ESN. As you've seen, the time line has been updated by the CMA panel, and they now expect a provisional decision in September with a final decision in December. And there's really not much more I can add at this point because I just don't know. I think it will play out in the back half of the year, but I think the engagement has been quite strong. And in the meantime, we continue to invest both in Airwave actively and providing that mission-critical service as well as ESN.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up. It looked like at a glance backlog trends remain very, very healthy. What does this say about elasticity in core products? I know you've been implementing some price increases understandably as your costs have increased. If you can maybe recap some of the price increases and talk about the elasticity that you're seeing given backlog trends, that would be helpful?\nJason Winkler: Sure. So when I think about the first half growth for the company, which is about 8%, the price contributions on the actions that Jack's sales team have implemented was less than half of the contributor to growth. And with the actions that Jack can describe, we will continue to do, we think it will be even more of an opportunity in the second half as most of the orders that come to us in the second half were not -- from a more recent backlog as opposed to aged pricing.\nJohn Molloy: No, I think you're right. And the other piece of that is just -- it's one thing to raise the price. And I think one of the things that our team has done a really nice job at is actually discount management. And so an example, we've raised prices in all 3 sleeves, all 3 technology groups, but also we've ushered in price increases in our services business as well. And we're seeing net retention increases there as well. So we're really proud and pleased with the services team on that aspect as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research.\nKeith Housum: Congratulations on a great quarter. I guess I just want to follow up on the supply chain. Much has been talked about the semiconductors and the $120 million will be spent through the end of the year. But can you talk about are there any other issues that have kind of popped up? Or are you guys looking to enter into 2023 is like a clean slate as you sit now?\nJason Winkler: Keith, $120 million you mentioned, which was our year-over-year expected increase largely for finding the semiconductor supply. We remain on target for that. It was a little higher than $100 million in the first half and might be a little higher than the $20 million in the second half. But as you know, with our increased guide, that's supporting a higher volume. So we're pleased with the allocation of that budget, if you will, to find semiconductors, which sometimes come into premium, I should note that that's not our primary method.  Our primary method is the rapid redesigns that our engineering teams are doing, and they're finding available alternatives if the part is constrained. And they're doing an amazing job there. We'll continue to look at that inventory investments and long-term supply agreements. So generally, it remains -- semiconductor is our largest-gated item, particularly in LMR.\nKeith Housum: Great. Appreciate it. This is a follow-up. In terms of the backlog, backlog has been record numbers for a while now, and this is impressive growth. But are we looking at an apples-to-apples comparison? Or is the backlog getting older in terms of the contracts that you're entering into are getting longer? Is there an apple-to-apples comparison we need to go through?\nJason Winkler: The duration of the backlog, if that's what you're getting at, Keith, is largely consistent with where we've been over time. if anything, the products backlog, which we continue to print sequential increases in, tends to be, as you know, a more quicker turning than the associated software and services. So we're pleased with the backlog growth in both segments. And it continues -- product's backlog increases continues even with some price increases that customers are accepting and value our products.\nOperator: Next question comes from Fahad Najam of Loop Capital.\nFahad Najam: Greg, in the 8 years that I've been listening to you on the earnings call, I think I was -- I feel like you sounded the most confident and positive that I've ever heard us. So am I correct in my understanding? And if it is, can you just walk me through what is driving your confidence and your positive look in terms of your top drivers?\nGregory Brown: Yes, Fahad, thanks for the question. I'm smiling because -- and we were talking about it, we have been talking about it. The fact of the matter is this is as good in an environment as I've seen. And I don't mean that just externally, as Jack and Jason have talked about multiyear funding here, particularly in North America, for state and local customers and at the federal level, but it's the position of the firm overall.  Demand is extremely high for public safety and enterprise security. We also see, at the same time, concerns, which I think are legitimate around deploying Chinese equipment in critical infrastructure or highly confidential or secure areas. Backlog is at record levels. Product backlog, as we talked about in Q2. Orders were 17% against the revenue print of 7%. So we're building it.  Jason just mentioned that the backlog comparison is largely apples-to-apples. We're performing and raising the full year from approximately 7% to 8% against continued FX headwinds. We're managing difficult semiconductor supply chain environment. And while it's very modestly better, I think the tip of the hat goes to the supply chain, financial and operational teams here at Motorola that are learning to do product redesign and manage inventory in a way that's constructive and productive to meet demand.  I love the deployment of capital that we've done. Organically, where Jack and Mahesh continue to emphasize innovation and move things to the cloud and do product refresh on devices. We've made, I think, pretty thoughtful and accretive and strategically important acquisitions, and our addressable market continues to grow as well. So when I look at execution, when I look at demand, when I look at R&D, when I look at innovation, when I look at multiyear funding, when I look at the overall factors that I think contribute enable and facilitate demand for our product, it's quite strong.  And as a final note, the ability for us to demonstrate multiple price increases and still grow backlog and still drive robust revenue growth speaks to the criticality of what we do and the ability for our customers to absorb that and our ability to pass on higher input costs. So it is a very good environment. It's why we beat both top and bottom in Q2, why we're raising the full year and why I feel very good about the momentum in the back half.\nFahad Najam: That's really insightful. So how does that translate into your model? Because last time when you gave up your long-term model, it was 9%, 10%. Clearly, you're exceeding that now. So what are you thinking about your new model?\nGregory Brown: No, I -- we were talking about that. I gave 9% and 10% in 2021, obviously, because I believed in it, we had COVID. COVID delayed things for a year, but here we are. We're not going to talk about any long-term model, Fahad, at this point, but we still believe that the product segment will grow mid-single digits, although our increase for the year from 7% to 8% is largely LMR and video. So actually, that increase from a segment standpoint is primarily in the product.  So it's maybe mid-single digits, nudging slightly higher. We still believe Software and Services will be approximately 10%. We agree with the -- we still are maintaining the guidance on the 3 technologies: LMR, mid-single digits; video security, approximately 20%; Command Center Software, low double digits as we continue to contribute to backlog and we like the momentum in the back half, I think it positions us well as we head into 2023. As we print more of the year and get more execution behind us, we'll update you accordingly on future thoughts for 2023 and beyond.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse.\nSami Badri: First, congrats on the quarter. I'm not sure many people are actually expecting an increase on the top line. But presenting the question that I had for you guys is, I wanted to know within products and systems integration. If we were just to look at radios and radio handsets, have you been prioritizing LMR public safety over PCR? Have you managed to ship and prioritize both essentially at the same level, right? Trying to get an idea on just mix. And then maybe just a clarification. Did you say that PCR is growing mid-single digits to slightly better in 2022? Or if you didn't actually clarify that, maybe you could just clarify it now?\nGregory Brown: Yes, Sami, I'll take the second one first. The product segment color is to continue to grow Product and SI at mid-single digit, maybe a little bit higher than that because the flow-through is in that segment. For PCR, last quarter, we said it would grow mid-single digit. We now expect it to grow at 10% or even slightly higher for the full year, given the strong performance in Q2 that will flow through in the back half.\nJason Winkler: And Sami, to answer your question on prioritization and balance, we continue to be focused on public safety. Q1, we have prioritized public safety. In Q2, with some of the breakthroughs the team was able to make around supply, we were able to fulfill more demand for PCR in Q2 and grew at double digits. So in Q2, given the supply environment, we were able to fulfill both public safety and PCR.\nSami Badri: Got it. And then I was hoping we could hear from Jack a little bit on body-worn camera and dash cam regarding license plate reading and some of the other kind of features that you guys have released. Can you give us an update on market share momentum? What's really going on from that side?\nJohn Molloy: Sure, Sami. So as it relates to Q2, our orders were up 13%. I think when you can textualize that over the fact that 13% over the previous quarter, that was up 80%, 8-0 percent, the previous year. We think we had a relatively strong order. You heard Jason reference the Detroit PD win. And I think that's a test point to what we've been saying is that the market wants an alternative.  I think the other piece of it is we're starting to see, late last year, we came out with as a service offer, and we're seeing an acceleration in our customers wanting to choose cloud. We've said before and I said at the end of 2021, we doubled our orders. We knew the market didn't grow that fast. We knew we took share in 2021.  I'd simply say for the first half of this year, given our performance kind of in the mid-teens growth over 68% and 80% orders growth comps, we think we're performing relatively well. And as I said, we think we're a very viable alternative in the marketplace right now.\nSami Badri: I have one quick one for Jason. Sorry, go ahead.\nMahesh Saptharishi: Just on the technology investments side that you also asked about, we continue to invest in a closer integration between our body-warn cameras and our radios as well, specifically with APX and APX NEXT devices. So for example, if you press the emergency button on an APX or an APX NEXT radio, it turns on recording as an option as well. And there are more features there to come as well.  This quarter, we also released live streaming capability going from the V300s and our in-car video solution to Aware. And Aware also integrates real-time location information from our APX and APX NEXT radios. So location information coming from both body-worn cameras and our radios together gives accurate information, again, location being a key necessity for our customers.  And lastly, we also introduced new advanced AI-driven reduction capability to CommandCentral evidence, which is a key capability that our customers have been asking for. And I think we're very proud of what we were able to put in.  Q2 also was our first shipping quarter for our M500 solution. The M500 started shipping in February of this year. We have seen great growth in the M500.  And just as a reminder, we released the M500 with 2 key AI capabilities, ALPR being one of them, and backseat passenger analytics being the second. This is a true AI platform, the M500 is, and we're going to be introducing more capabilities we have firmware upgrade into that platform as well. We think there's great potential there.\nSami Badri: Jason, one quick one on your FX guidance -- your FX headwind guidance for the year. Is that including international currencies improve relative to the U.S. dollar? Or does that assume everything equal from this point forward on FX rates?\nJason Winkler: Current spot rates going forward relative to last year. So the $170 million of headwinds on the year is about consistent with where it was the last quarter we were together. It's certainly been volatile. But today, it's at approximately $170 million of top line degradation related to FX this year.\nOperator: Next question comes from Paul Silverstein of Cowen.\nPaul Silverstein: One clarification. What was the level of PCR in the quarter? And can you remind us -- I think it peaked out at $1 billion before the pandemic hit. But can you remind us of where you're at in the recovery of that business?\nJason Winkler: For Q2, Paul, PCR revenue growth was 15%.\nGregory Brown: And it's base last year, Paul, was $800-and-something million. And so it's on -- as we told you earlier, 10%, maybe slightly higher this year, which will put it still short of the 2019 reference point you just made.\nPaul Silverstein: All right. So the real question is -- I'm sorry, go ahead.\nJohn Molloy: Paul, I was just going to add one other point is that Q2 was a record orders quarter for PCR as well.\nGregory Brown: Exactly.\nPaul Silverstein: Okay. And notwithstanding the macro, obviously, it sounds like the business has been given all the different variables that seem to be so positive, where is the greatest opportunity for greatest improvement from here going forward over the next 12 to 36 months? And in connection with that, I saw was not able to pay you cash in respect of the litigation. Where does that -- are they being effectively shut out of the market? Where does that go from here? And finally, where is video penetration and in the public sector?\nGregory Brown: Well, let's start with Hytera. I'm kind of not surprised that they missed the deadline, the court order deadline to pay cash into escrow by July 31. They've had a pattern of denied, deflect, distract and no action. They owe us about $680 million all in. By the way, the guidance and color we give you on the full year of 2022 and cash and cash flow assume nothing from Hytera.  We filed a motion this morning that they are in contempt of court. And we'll see what the judge rules and remedies -- further remedies that they apply, but I can't say I'm particularly surprised.\nJohn Molloy: Paul, I think you had a question as well on video, and I would just simply say that, our video and access control business is growing approximately 20% this year in 2022. We continue to invest in the portfolio extensively, both by way of our edge devices or camera. But also in the -- on our software and analytics side of the things, cloud and mobile become increasingly important when you think about our 3 big acquisitions: Openpath, who has fundamentally changed the game for us in the access control market; Ava and Calipsa as well.  The AI that Calipsa bring and its ability to proliferate into our Pelco camera line is also a game changer. And I think you asked a question about verticals. But when we think about our top verticals, it's really government, education, health care and commercial. If you remember, when we acquired Avigilon in February of 2018, their government business was nascent. And now it's one of our top ones. And we think that's the benefit of the scale and the revenue synergies that our sales force around the globe has been able to bring.\nPaul Silverstein: Okay. The real question was, I assume it's still preciously early in the government, public sector in terms of video penetration.\nJohn Molloy: Yes. So I think we talked about, first of all, just a baseline and government, it's early days. But to eventualize that business, it's approximately $430 million is our expectation this year. Think of that as 2/3 mobile video, 1/3 fixed video.\nOperator: Next question comes from Louie DiPalma of William Blair.\nMichael DiPalma: Greg, on previous calls, you referenced how you are seeing robust demand from the education vertical. Is demand from education customers for your artificial intelligence solutions getting even stronger with this exceptionally strong guidance for this upcoming school year following several different security incidents nationwide?\nGregory Brown: Yes, Louie, Education has been a very key vertical, along with government for fixed video and access control. It has been and continues to be because of what you referenced the need for video security, perimeter detection, anomaly detection, access control, automation alerts. And I think that the demand for that broad portfolio continues to be strong and maybe perhaps is even getting stronger. And I don't know if Jack or Mahesh want to complement on that as well.\nJohn Molloy: Greg, I think you hit it. The other one is we made a significant investment to evolve technologies. And I would say stadiums and schools are the big driver for concealed weapons detection. We know the horrific things that happened at Uvalde just earlier in the summer. And I think that's driving a converged experience to make sure that they've got the video and access control, but they also have a way to temper and test for weapons as they approach campus as well.\nJason Winkler: The other point I'd make is that our Q2 results and our increased guide for the year were driven largely by our expectations for LMR, which is about 2/3 of the increase in video and then the other 1/3, both of which are serving education and many other verticals.\nMichael DiPalma: And for Jack, these past 2 quarters, it appears that you won your 2 largest Command Center Software orders in company history. And I think you mentioned in a prior answer that you are seeing traction with hybrid deployments on-premise and the cloud. Were any of your recent orders for your next-gen 911 solution and your 911 call taking and CAD solution in the cloud? Or are these more for your traditional modules that you're seeing the success?\nMahesh Saptharishi: This is Mahesh. I'd say that there's still stronger demand for the on-premises solution for 911 and CAD. Availability and reliability being some key factors that are involved there. That said, our call handling solutions combined with our heavy investment in smart transcription, which is a cloud-hosted AI solution; Citizen Input, which is also a cloud-hosted way of allowing citizens to have over-the-top video input and text input into PSAP as well for call handling, we're seeing significant traction in that space.  On CAD, hybrid capabilities become very important. We are seeing Aware -- CommandCentral Aware frequently attached with our CAD sales. And the other thing is emphasis on mobile. For LAPD, I mentioned CommandCentral Responder. The need for smartphone access to information in the field is becoming more and more important. And CommandCentral Responder, along with its many capabilities, really complements both our on-premise CAD and record solutions as well. So we see that hybrid really driving adoption for the key features that are best delivered in the cloud, along with the high available solutions that our 911 and CAD customers want.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Chung of JPMorgan.\nPaul Chung: So just on the guide, how do we think about kind of the gross margin ramp in the second half? Do you still expect to be kind of flat for the year? And then same kind of question on OpEx. I may have missed it, but still up kind of $100 million for the year. And then as we think about '23, how much of kind of the gross margin pressure this year do you see as somewhat temporary in your expectations of how those margins rebound and particularly in the first half? You also have some benefits from price increases as well and how that kind of factors in? Just your early thoughts on '23.\nJason Winkler: Well, I'll start with the biggest driver of our gross margin trend this year is the higher semiconductor costs year-over-year. We had planned for about $100 million of year-over-year increase, which you're seeing in the P&L through the first half. It was actually a little higher than that. And we had planned for $20 million of incremental year-over-year cost for semiconductors in the second half, it will probably be slightly higher than that, given the higher volumes that we just guided to.  So those items, again, are related to us paying a premium for semiconductors that aren't available from primary sources. So as the semiconductor market stabilizes, normalizes, there's opportunity on that as we continue to get more and more supply into the future directly from the manufacturers, which is something we're working on.  In terms of gross margin trend, for the year, yes. The second half will be certainly better, and we'll get to approximately similar and OE slightly up for the year, which will cover the $100 million of OpEx, you're right, of increase that we're expecting for the year-over-year, $75 million of which from the OpEx side is related to M&A. So that's how to think about it from a P&L perspective.\nPaul Chung: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on video. You're seeing some relative strength in the Software and Services for quite some time. So talk about the demand trends and specific solutions you're kind of most excited about? And how do we think about that relative pace as we look further out?\nJohn Molloy: Yes. Paul, I think so we've talked about we expect 20% for fixed video and really for the video segment as well, approximately 20% for the full year. We've dimensionalized some of the verticals. We're having some success. I think it's a story about cloud, mobile analytics.  The other piece of it that we probably didn't talk are some of the vertical specific things that we're doing. We acquired a company called Envision. That gives us a space into quick-service retail. And investments like that as well as cloud put us on a path where we're starting to build a recurring revenue business within our video security segment as well, which is exciting.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup.\nJames Suva: Congratulations to you and your team. Greg, when we think about strategy, and you mentioned you had your biggest LMR contract ever, which is great. Are you now at a point where the majority of your new wins are including multiple cross-sell Motorola Solutions, product solutions, services, command centers and things like that? Or are we still at the very early part of not much is be connected? That was kind of my strategy question.  Then for finance -- Chief Financial Officer question. Did you say how much impacted gross margins decommits or go into a broker market was for components? And I assume when you get these big contracts, you're securing the parts right away, so you don't have future price escalation as chip companies have increased pricing?\nGregory Brown: Well, on the first part, Jim, I think we're in the early innings overall. I mean you take a step back and think about this firm and our addressable market now given the industries we play in and the acquisitions we've made, it's just under $50 billion. And the guidance this year for full year informs approximately 9%. So there's a lot of room to run here.  While we are growing fixed video and access control at 20%, we are not the leader yet, either globally or in North America. And I think there's every opportunity for us to continue to take share and make up ground given the width and breadth of the portfolio, which I believe from an industry standpoint is unmatched. Our ability to play in fixed video and mobile video, layer on analytics, license plate recognition and all the things that Mahesh and the technical team are doing an artificial intelligence.  On LMR, the installed base gets larger. You think about roughly 13,000 different LMR networks, by which we fill the footprint of infrastructure, sell devices, monetize services, upsell, refresh the device portfolio, integrate LTE into LMR for network extension and software over-the-air reprogramming and location services. And then all the things Mahesh is doing in Command Center Software, which is premises-based, cloud-based, hybrid and the overall backdrop of more and more criticality around public safety, enterprise security and not having key China vendors in any of that critical infrastructure, I think there's a lot of opportunity in front of us.\nJohn Molloy: The only thing I'd add, Greg, is I think, Jim, I think I heard you ask a question on cross-sell. It's very important. We've attacked that by way of sales specific incentives around Command Center Software around fixed and mobile video as well. Our North America sales leader, Jim, here is, has come up with -- first of all, we have a tool, a 3-dimensional tool by account that gives us kind of the lay of the land where we're doing well and where we're not and where we should focus our time. And we've inserted a sales around specific technology escalators. And that, I think, served us fairly well.\nJason Winkler: And Jim, to answer your question on securing semiconductor components, we're doing so in many different ways, directly from the manufacturer through us and purchase orders all the way through long-term supply agreements. And then finally, brokers when necessary, and therefore, have a constant flow of parts. I think it's important to note that Motorola and our engineering abilities, over 40% of our company are engineers. And we continually give them challenges, including if a part we know to be in constraint, they are helping find alternatives. And that alternative, then the supply chain organization can go out and procure. So it's a constant battle, and we're proud of the way the teams are collaborating and working through the environment.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any additional comments or closing remarks.\nGregory Brown: Yes. Thank you, everybody. Most especially, thank you for all the Motorolans on the call and listening. Exceptional performance, couldn't be more proud of you. I'm proud of this company, proud of you and proud of the purpose that we serve. I think -- look, I think these results amplify and reinforce the criticality of public safety and enterprise security and the fact that in this environment, quite frankly, it's never been more important.  I want to add to something Jason just said and tip my hat to everybody involved on supply chain execution and navigating this very dynamic environment. I do think part of the overperformance in Q2 and what we're passing on for the full year is strong execution in supply chain. I think it's largely done by the engineers that Jason referenced and others on product redesign, surgical acquisition of inventory, appropriate purchases in the open market for broker parts and a modestly slightly better environment in Q2.  But the supply chain, specifically semiconductor environment remains challenging. Having said all that, there's more work to be done, but I do like our position and I like our momentum for the second half. We have to continue to execute.  I appreciate you listening, and I look forward to talking to you and joining you in a few months. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

            "name": "Jason Winkler",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter was up 9% and above our guidance with record second quarter revenue in both segments. We saw strong growth across all 3 technologies, led by over 20% growth in both Video and Command Center Software. In LMR, which grew 5%, we were able to secure more critical parts, particularly later in the quarter, which enabled us to ship more product.  Acquisitions during the quarter added $34 million and FX headwinds were $44 million. GAAP operating earnings were $358 million, and operating margins were 16.7%. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $497 million, up $15 million or 3% from the year ago quarter, and non-GAAP operating margins were 23.2%, down from 24.4%. The decline in operating margins was due to the higher semiconductor costs we outlined on our prior calls related to acquiring critical supply in the secondary market, together with higher freight costs and higher operating expenses related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher sales.  GAAP earnings per share was $1.33 compared to $1.69 per share in the year ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit recognized in the prior year and higher direct material costs in the current year. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.07, flat versus last year. The higher sales and operating earnings generated in the current quarter were offset by the higher direct material costs I mentioned previously, along with higher operating expenses related to acquisitions.  OpEx in Q2 was $502 million, up $25 million, primarily due to acquisitions. Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $10 million compared with $388 million in the prior year, and free cash flow was a usage of $49 million compared to $326 million generated in the prior year. In Q2 and the first half of the year, our cash flow has been primarily impacted by 2 items: first, our planned investments in inventory to navigate the dynamic supply chain environment and position us to fulfill the record demand we're seeing in Video and LMR; second, higher employee incentive payments that were tied to 2021's performance and paid out this year.  We expect our cash flow conversion to accelerate in the second half, driven by higher profitability and a reduction in our current inventory levels in addition to the normal seasonality of our cash conversion. Capital allocation for Q2 included $162 million in share repurchases, $132 million in cash dividends and $59 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, we closed the video acquisitions of Calipsa for $40 million and Videotec for $22 million. We also issued $600 million of long-term debt, used a portion of the proceeds to retire $275 million, resulting in approximately $320 million of incremental debt net of fees on our balance sheet.  In the Products and SI segment, we continue to see strong demand across both LMR and video. Sales during the quarter were up 7% versus last year and orders were up 17%, including record Q2 orders for both LMR and video. Revenue from acquisitions for this segment in the quarter was $14 million and currency headwinds were $19 million. Operating earnings for Products and SI were $188 million or 14.6%, down from 16.2% of sales in the prior year, driven primarily by the higher material costs and higher freight costs previously mentioned, partially offset by higher sales.  We continue to expect full year operating margins for this segment to be slightly higher than 2021 as the impact from pricing actions accelerates in the second half. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in the segment include several large P25 orders in the U.S., including $32 million for a state of California agency, $27 million for Dutchess County, New York and $22 million order for the Georgia Department of Corrections. We also had a $26 million order for a P25 solution with LTE integration for an international customer, a $15 million TETRA order for a customer in Argentina. And finally, we received 2 large fixed video orders, a $9 million order for a customer in the health care vertical and an $8 million order for a large retail customer.  In the Software and Services segment, revenue was up 11%, with revenue from acquisitions of $20 million and currency headwinds of $25 million during the quarter. Total software revenue was up 25%, driven by strong demand in video and a large deployment in Command Center Software, while in LMR services, revenue was up 5%. Operating earnings in the segment were $309 million or 36.1% of sales, down 110 basis points from last year, driven by a change in year-over-year mix and higher M&A expenses, partially offset by higher sales.  We continue to expect segment operating margins for Software and Services for the full year to be comparable to last year, inclusive of the additional OpEx spend from our recent acquisitions. Some notable Q2 highlights in this segment include 2 large multiyear LMR service renewals, $43 million with the state of South Australia and $35 million with the state of Mississippi. We also had 3 large Command Center Softwares in the U.S. -- orders in the U.S., $35 million from a large metropolitan city, $14 million from the Los Angeles Police Department and $11 million from Frederick County, Maryland. We were also awarded an $8 million body-worn camera order from the Detroit Police Department.  Moving next to our regional results. North America Q2 revenue was $1.5 billion, up 13% on growth in all 3 technologies. International Q2 revenue was $656 million, flat versus last year, with growth in all 3 technologies, offset by unfavorable FX.  Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog was a record -- Q2 record of $13.4 billion, up 19% or $2.2 billion compared to last year, inclusive of approximately $500 million of unfavorable FX. The growth was driven by the Airwave extension recorded in the fourth quarter of '21 and increased demand across all 3 technologies. Sequentially, backlog was down $21 million, driven primarily by a $397 million movement in unfavorable FX and the quarterly revenue burn related to the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset by record Q2 orders in LMR products, video and Command Center Software.  In the Products and SI segment, continued robust order demand in both LMR and Video is driving record backlog, which was up $986 million or 30% compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $206 million, which was our eighth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth in the products segment. Additionally, our product backlog increasingly reflects new pricing, which we expect to contribute to the profitability ramp for the second half.  In Software and Services, backlog was $1.2 billion compared to last year, driven also by the Airwave extension and a $380 million increase in multiyear services and software backlog in North America. Sequentially, backlog was down $227 million or 2%, driven primarily by unfavorable FX and revenue recognition for the Airwave and ESN contracts, partially offset by record second quarter orders in Command Center Software.  Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 10%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.85 and $2.90 per share. This assumes approximately $60 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 20%. And for the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 8%, up from our prior guidance of 7%, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $10.03 and $10.13 per share up from our prior guide of $9.80 to $9.95 per share. This updated guidance includes FX headwinds of approximately $170 million, a diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 21.5%.  Before I turn the call back to Greg, I would like to highlight some of the priorities we are driving for the remainder of the year. First, we remain focused on supply chain execution, both tactically and strategically, including rapid redesigns by our engineering teams to substitute to available semiconductors, alternatives, strategic inventory investments that we are making, securing high-demand discrete semiconductors from brokers when necessary and entering into long-term supply agreements where possible.  Second, our pricing actions across the portfolio have been effective to date, and we'll continue to look at pricing opportunities and maintain cost discipline as we manage through a higher cost environment. And finally, we are balancing the benefits of higher inventory with cash conversion, and we'll continue to optimize our working capital and balance sheet to drive increased cash flow in the second half.  I'll now turn the call back over to Greg. Sure. So when I think about the first half growth for the company, which is about 8%, the price contributions on the actions that Jack's sales team have implemented was less than half of the contributor to growth. And with the actions that Jack can describe, we will continue to do, we think it will be even more of an opportunity in the second half as most of the orders that come to us in the second half were not -- from a more recent backlog as opposed to aged pricing. Keith, $120 million you mentioned, which was our year-over-year expected increase largely for finding the semiconductor supply. We remain on target for that. It was a little higher than $100 million in the first half and might be a little higher than the $20 million in the second half. But as you know, with our increased guide, that's supporting a higher volume. So we're pleased with the allocation of that budget, if you will, to find semiconductors, which sometimes come into premium, I should note that that's not our primary method.  Our primary method is the rapid redesigns that our engineering teams are doing, and they're finding available alternatives if the part is constrained. And they're doing an amazing job there. We'll continue to look at that inventory investments and long-term supply agreements. So generally, it remains -- semiconductor is our largest-gated item, particularly in LMR. The duration of the backlog, if that's what you're getting at, Keith, is largely consistent with where we've been over time. if anything, the products backlog, which we continue to print sequential increases in, tends to be, as you know, a more quicker turning than the associated software and services. So we're pleased with the backlog growth in both segments. And it continues -- product's backlog increases continues even with some price increases that customers are accepting and value our products. And Sami, to answer your question on prioritization and balance, we continue to be focused on public safety. Q1, we have prioritized public safety. In Q2, with some of the breakthroughs the team was able to make around supply, we were able to fulfill more demand for PCR in Q2 and grew at double digits. So in Q2, given the supply environment, we were able to fulfill both public safety and PCR. Current spot rates going forward relative to last year. So the $170 million of headwinds on the year is about consistent with where it was the last quarter we were together. It's certainly been volatile. But today, it's at approximately $170 million of top line degradation related to FX this year. For Q2, Paul, PCR revenue growth was 15%. The other point I'd make is that our Q2 results and our increased guide for the year were driven largely by our expectations for LMR, which is about 2/3 of the increase in video and then the other 1/3, both of which are serving education and many other verticals. Well, I'll start with the biggest driver of our gross margin trend this year is the higher semiconductor costs year-over-year. We had planned for about $100 million of year-over-year increase, which you're seeing in the P&L through the first half. It was actually a little higher than that. And we had planned for $20 million of incremental year-over-year cost for semiconductors in the second half, it will probably be slightly higher than that, given the higher volumes that we just guided to.  So those items, again, are related to us paying a premium for semiconductors that aren't available from primary sources. So as the semiconductor market stabilizes, normalizes, there's opportunity on that as we continue to get more and more supply into the future directly from the manufacturers, which is something we're working on.  In terms of gross margin trend, for the year, yes. The second half will be certainly better, and we'll get to approximately similar and OE slightly up for the year, which will cover the $100 million of OpEx, you're right, of increase that we're expecting for the year-over-year, $75 million of which from the OpEx side is related to M&A. So that's how to think about it from a P&L perspective. And Jim, to answer your question on securing semiconductor components, we're doing so in many different ways, directly from the manufacturer through us and purchase orders all the way through long-term supply agreements. And then finally, brokers when necessary, and therefore, have a constant flow of parts. I think it's important to note that Motorola and our engineering abilities, over 40% of our company are engineers. And we continually give them challenges, including if a part we know to be in constraint, they are helping find alternatives. And that alternative, then the supply chain organization can go out and procure. So it's a constant battle, and we're proud of the way the teams are collaborating and working through the environment."

            "content": "Sure, George. So when you think about state and local budgets, I mean, I think, first of all, we hear us say it time and time again, what we do, what we provide is a need to have, not a nice to have. But as it relates to the inflationary environment we're dealing in, self-funding alone for states, they're in a very beneficial period of time. Because if you look at it, they derive their budgets from personal income tax, from sales tax and from corporate income tax, all of which stand the benefit to drive more money into their coffers and thereby, improve their general fund situation.  So it's that piece of it. We also look at the second rail of this, and that's the monies that are being made available through ARPA. And I would just simply say that we've talked about it, it's generally beneficial, and we think it's a general tailwind. But the most important thing is it's not a 2022 phenomenon. It's one that's multiyear.  And in fact, these won't expire until 2024, and all likelihood we know is those will likely be extended. So you've heard Greg said it. I think he said in the script, but we're in a really unique situation because we are in a good funding environment. But I think it also is timely because we're going through product refresh investments. We're seeing that here in the United States with the APX NEXT platform. And later this year, we're going to be announcing the mid-tier APX NEXT devices, which we're really excited about. Yes. So as I've said before, we're in the early innings of the P25 upgrade cycle. I used the baseball metaphor. And our -- I believe it was our February call in second inning, I think we're largely still in that period of time. But just a couple of updates, $190 million of orders. Interestingly, we're seeing a lot of interest from non-Motorola customers, and it's not only the better basics, the ergonomics and the audio performance of the APX NEXT, but it's really the Smart Connect.  And so what our customers saw during COVID, particularly people like health departments, was the capability to expand their coverage outside of the P25 networks. It's also things like smart mapping. We think about accountability, we think about officer and firefighter safety, location is paramount to that. And then we're also looking at messaging as we have more and more young officers in the field, they need ways, different modalities like text and video and the capability to share those. That type of data and they're using the LTE collaborative aspect of the APX NEXT.  So again, really excited. But I would note that we've -- the $190 million has all been targeted at the highest tier, which is the original APX NEXT with subsequent releases in the second half of this year with the mid-tier portfolio, which we're starting to engage in customer discussions on. No, I think you're right. And the other piece of that is just -- it's one thing to raise the price. And I think one of the things that our team has done a really nice job at is actually discount management. And so an example, we've raised prices in all 3 sleeves, all 3 technology groups, but also we've ushered in price increases in our services business as well. And we're seeing net retention increases there as well. So we're really proud and pleased with the services team on that aspect as well. Sure, Sami. So as it relates to Q2, our orders were up 13%. I think when you can textualize that over the fact that 13% over the previous quarter, that was up 80%, 8-0 percent, the previous year. We think we had a relatively strong order. You heard Jason reference the Detroit PD win. And I think that's a test point to what we've been saying is that the market wants an alternative.  I think the other piece of it is we're starting to see, late last year, we came out with as a service offer, and we're seeing an acceleration in our customers wanting to choose cloud. We've said before and I said at the end of 2021, we doubled our orders. We knew the market didn't grow that fast. We knew we took share in 2021.  I'd simply say for the first half of this year, given our performance kind of in the mid-teens growth over 68% and 80% orders growth comps, we think we're performing relatively well. And as I said, we think we're a very viable alternative in the marketplace right now. Paul, I was just going to add one other point is that Q2 was a record orders quarter for PCR as well. Paul, I think you had a question as well on video, and I would just simply say that, our video and access control business is growing approximately 20% this year in 2022. We continue to invest in the portfolio extensively, both by way of our edge devices or camera. But also in the -- on our software and analytics side of the things, cloud and mobile become increasingly important when you think about our 3 big acquisitions: Openpath, who has fundamentally changed the game for us in the access control market; Ava and Calipsa as well.  The AI that Calipsa bring and its ability to proliferate into our Pelco camera line is also a game changer. And I think you asked a question about verticals. But when we think about our top verticals, it's really government, education, health care and commercial. If you remember, when we acquired Avigilon in February of 2018, their government business was nascent. And now it's one of our top ones. And we think that's the benefit of the scale and the revenue synergies that our sales force around the globe has been able to bring. Yes. So I think we talked about, first of all, just a baseline and government, it's early days. But to eventualize that business, it's approximately $430 million is our expectation this year. Think of that as 2/3 mobile video, 1/3 fixed video. Greg, I think you hit it. The other one is we made a significant investment to evolve technologies. And I would say stadiums and schools are the big driver for concealed weapons detection. We know the horrific things that happened at Uvalde just earlier in the summer. And I think that's driving a converged experience to make sure that they've got the video and access control, but they also have a way to temper and test for weapons as they approach campus as well. Yes. Paul, I think so we've talked about we expect 20% for fixed video and really for the video segment as well, approximately 20% for the full year. We've dimensionalized some of the verticals. We're having some success. I think it's a story about cloud, mobile analytics.  The other piece of it that we probably didn't talk are some of the vertical specific things that we're doing. We acquired a company called Envision. That gives us a space into quick-service retail. And investments like that as well as cloud put us on a path where we're starting to build a recurring revenue business within our video security segment as well, which is exciting. The only thing I'd add, Greg, is I think, Jim, I think I heard you ask a question on cross-sell. It's very important. We've attacked that by way of sales specific incentives around Command Center Software around fixed and mobile video as well. Our North America sales leader, Jim, here is, has come up with -- first of all, we have a tool, a 3-dimensional tool by account that gives us kind of the lay of the land where we're doing well and where we're not and where we should focus our time. And we've inserted a sales around specific technology escalators. And that, I think, served us fairly well."

            "content": "Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through the results and our outlook.  First, Q2 was exceptional across the board with revenue and earnings per share both coming in above our expectations. In Software and Services, revenue was up 11%, highlighted by strong software growth. And in Products and SI, continued record demand across both land mobile radio and video, led to 7% revenue growth and 17% orders growth, driving increased backlog.  Additionally, we ended the quarter with record Q2 backlog of $13.4 billion, up 19% versus last year, inclusive of approximately $500 million of unfavorable currency impact. Second, our portfolio and go-to-market investments are continuing to drive meaningful growth across all 3 technologies. During the quarter, revenue was up 21% in both video and command Center Software, and we saw record Q2 orders in both of those technologies as well. And in LMR, demand is growing for our high Tier P25 APX NEXT device with customers embracing its unique ability to offer the must-have reliability of LMR while seamlessly leveraging broadband features such as remote programming, network extension and location services.  And finally, based on our Q2 record ending backlog and continued strong operational execution, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share.  At this point, I'll turn it over to Jason, who will take you through our results and outlook and then return for some final thoughts. Jason, thanks. I'd like to end with a few thoughts as we conclude this call. First, I'm really pleased with what we accomplished during the quarter. We achieved Q2 record sales, including 21% growth in both video and Command Center Software. We strengthened our video portfolio with the acquisitions of Calipsa, which brings us advanced cloud native video analytics, and Videotec, which broadens our ruggedized camera portfolio to serve the critical infrastructure market.  We had record Q2 product orders at higher prices, including our single largest quarter ever for PCR orders, and we ended the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog. The pricing actions we've taken to offset higher input costs position us well for margin expansion for the back half of this year.  Second, our investments in AI and cloud continue to drive robust software growth for the company. Customers like Greenville County schools in South Carolina depend on our video security and access control solution to help keep students safe. And the city of Houston is deploying more than 3,000 body-worn cameras with cloud-based evidence management to help provide greater accountability and transparency.  And with the acquisitions such as AVA Security and Calipsa, we're well positioned to accelerate the deployment of cloud video software solutions with customers around the world. And finally, as we enter the second half of this year, I am very encouraged by our momentum. The multiyear funding environment for our customers continues to be as strong as it's ever been, our solutions for both public safety and enterprise security have never been more important. Our strong execution has allowed us to effectively navigate this dynamic environment.  And finally, the resilience of our business, our durable cash flows and our strong balance sheet provide us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in our future deployment of capital.  And now I'll turn the call back over to Tim and welcome your questions. And Erik, the $190 million of orders is since the APX NEXT product was introduced, but I'd also add that just, in general, Q2 was a record for P25 public safety devices, which is more broad than APX NEXT as well. So APX NEXT continues to fire away. And just to -- I think the team did a superb job in product introduction. Molloy's team has sold it, but also more broadly beyond APX NEXT, Q2 was a record for 25 public safety orders, which I'm quite happy about as well. Yes. I think things remain engaged and in progress, Adam, really. We are in close contact with the customer, in this case, the U.K. home office. We've maintained very close contact with the CMA and have regularly provided them with information over the last several weeks and months as we educate them on our role in both Airwave and ESN. As you've seen, the time line has been updated by the CMA panel, and they now expect a provisional decision in September with a final decision in December. And there's really not much more I can add at this point because I just don't know. I think it will play out in the back half of the year, but I think the engagement has been quite strong. And in the meantime, we continue to invest both in Airwave actively and providing that mission-critical service as well as ESN. Yes, Fahad, thanks for the question. I'm smiling because -- and we were talking about it, we have been talking about it. The fact of the matter is this is as good in an environment as I've seen. And I don't mean that just externally, as Jack and Jason have talked about multiyear funding here, particularly in North America, for state and local customers and at the federal level, but it's the position of the firm overall.  Demand is extremely high for public safety and enterprise security. We also see, at the same time, concerns, which I think are legitimate around deploying Chinese equipment in critical infrastructure or highly confidential or secure areas. Backlog is at record levels. Product backlog, as we talked about in Q2. Orders were 17% against the revenue print of 7%. So we're building it.  Jason just mentioned that the backlog comparison is largely apples-to-apples. We're performing and raising the full year from approximately 7% to 8% against continued FX headwinds. We're managing difficult semiconductor supply chain environment. And while it's very modestly better, I think the tip of the hat goes to the supply chain, financial and operational teams here at Motorola that are learning to do product redesign and manage inventory in a way that's constructive and productive to meet demand.  I love the deployment of capital that we've done. Organically, where Jack and Mahesh continue to emphasize innovation and move things to the cloud and do product refresh on devices. We've made, I think, pretty thoughtful and accretive and strategically important acquisitions, and our addressable market continues to grow as well. So when I look at execution, when I look at demand, when I look at R&D, when I look at innovation, when I look at multiyear funding, when I look at the overall factors that I think contribute enable and facilitate demand for our product, it's quite strong.  And as a final note, the ability for us to demonstrate multiple price increases and still grow backlog and still drive robust revenue growth speaks to the criticality of what we do and the ability for our customers to absorb that and our ability to pass on higher input costs. So it is a very good environment. It's why we beat both top and bottom in Q2, why we're raising the full year and why I feel very good about the momentum in the back half. No, I -- we were talking about that. I gave 9% and 10% in 2021, obviously, because I believed in it, we had COVID. COVID delayed things for a year, but here we are. We're not going to talk about any long-term model, Fahad, at this point, but we still believe that the product segment will grow mid-single digits, although our increase for the year from 7% to 8% is largely LMR and video. So actually, that increase from a segment standpoint is primarily in the product.  So it's maybe mid-single digits, nudging slightly higher. We still believe Software and Services will be approximately 10%. We agree with the -- we still are maintaining the guidance on the 3 technologies: LMR, mid-single digits; video security, approximately 20%; Command Center Software, low double digits as we continue to contribute to backlog and we like the momentum in the back half, I think it positions us well as we head into 2023. As we print more of the year and get more execution behind us, we'll update you accordingly on future thoughts for 2023 and beyond. Yes, Sami, I'll take the second one first. The product segment color is to continue to grow Product and SI at mid-single digit, maybe a little bit higher than that because the flow-through is in that segment. For PCR, last quarter, we said it would grow mid-single digit. We now expect it to grow at 10% or even slightly higher for the full year, given the strong performance in Q2 that will flow through in the back half. And it's base last year, Paul, was $800-and-something million. And so it's on -- as we told you earlier, 10%, maybe slightly higher this year, which will put it still short of the 2019 reference point you just made. Exactly. Well, let's start with Hytera. I'm kind of not surprised that they missed the deadline, the court order deadline to pay cash into escrow by July 31. They've had a pattern of denied, deflect, distract and no action. They owe us about $680 million all in. By the way, the guidance and color we give you on the full year of 2022 and cash and cash flow assume nothing from Hytera.  We filed a motion this morning that they are in contempt of court. And we'll see what the judge rules and remedies -- further remedies that they apply, but I can't say I'm particularly surprised. Yes, Louie, Education has been a very key vertical, along with government for fixed video and access control. It has been and continues to be because of what you referenced the need for video security, perimeter detection, anomaly detection, access control, automation alerts. And I think that the demand for that broad portfolio continues to be strong and maybe perhaps is even getting stronger. And I don't know if Jack or Mahesh want to complement on that as well. Well, on the first part, Jim, I think we're in the early innings overall. I mean you take a step back and think about this firm and our addressable market now given the industries we play in and the acquisitions we've made, it's just under $50 billion. And the guidance this year for full year informs approximately 9%. So there's a lot of room to run here.  While we are growing fixed video and access control at 20%, we are not the leader yet, either globally or in North America. And I think there's every opportunity for us to continue to take share and make up ground given the width and breadth of the portfolio, which I believe from an industry standpoint is unmatched. Our ability to play in fixed video and mobile video, layer on analytics, license plate recognition and all the things that Mahesh and the technical team are doing an artificial intelligence.  On LMR, the installed base gets larger. You think about roughly 13,000 different LMR networks, by which we fill the footprint of infrastructure, sell devices, monetize services, upsell, refresh the device portfolio, integrate LTE into LMR for network extension and software over-the-air reprogramming and location services. And then all the things Mahesh is doing in Command Center Software, which is premises-based, cloud-based, hybrid and the overall backdrop of more and more criticality around public safety, enterprise security and not having key China vendors in any of that critical infrastructure, I think there's a lot of opportunity in front of us. Yes. Thank you, everybody. Most especially, thank you for all the Motorolans on the call and listening. Exceptional performance, couldn't be more proud of you. I'm proud of this company, proud of you and proud of the purpose that we serve. I think -- look, I think these results amplify and reinforce the criticality of public safety and enterprise security and the fact that in this environment, quite frankly, it's never been more important.  I want to add to something Jason just said and tip my hat to everybody involved on supply chain execution and navigating this very dynamic environment. I do think part of the overperformance in Q2 and what we're passing on for the full year is strong execution in supply chain. I think it's largely done by the engineers that Jason referenced and others on product redesign, surgical acquisition of inventory, appropriate purchases in the open market for broker parts and a modestly slightly better environment in Q2.  But the supply chain, specifically semiconductor environment remains challenging. Having said all that, there's more work to be done, but I do like our position and I like our momentum for the second half. We have to continue to execute.  I appreciate you listening, and I look forward to talking to you and joining you in a few months. Thanks, everybody."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Mahesh Saptharishi",
            "content": "Yes. So maybe just a quick overview. Jason mentioned 2 specific deals, LVMPD, Frederick County. If you look at both of those, LVMPD was on-premises records deal, but really a hybrid element to it, and that was the CommandCentral Responder piece, which is really driven by mobile access to records information. We're seeing more and more of that, and that hybrid element was key to that particular deal.  With Frederick, we added CommandCentral Aware in addition to PremierOne CAD. Aware is a cloud hosted a SaaS solution for us. And Aware gives the county a single plane of glass to understand where unit locations are, both from radios and also from incident information. It is as Jack said previously location information being paramount -- accurate location information being paramount in that case. We continue to invest in our hybrid strategy. We're executing on our hybrid strategy.  And a key point there is that our SaaS growth rate is actually faster than the overall Command Center Software growth rate, which itself was quite strong in this quarter. And the last thing that I'll say is we're continuing to innovate and invest in innovations. And we had 2 significant firsts this quarter. One is, we introduced the world's first public safety Carplay application, one that we developed with Western Australia Police and with Apple. And the second is along with Prince Georges County in Maryland, we won the Thomas O'Reilly Innovation Award for being the first in the country to introduce location-based routing -- NENA i3 compliant location-based routing. So together, I think we are executing well on our hybrid strategy. Just on the technology investments side that you also asked about, we continue to invest in a closer integration between our body-warn cameras and our radios as well, specifically with APX and APX NEXT devices. So for example, if you press the emergency button on an APX or an APX NEXT radio, it turns on recording as an option as well. And there are more features there to come as well.  This quarter, we also released live streaming capability going from the V300s and our in-car video solution to Aware. And Aware also integrates real-time location information from our APX and APX NEXT radios. So location information coming from both body-worn cameras and our radios together gives accurate information, again, location being a key necessity for our customers.  And lastly, we also introduced new advanced AI-driven reduction capability to CommandCentral evidence, which is a key capability that our customers have been asking for. And I think we're very proud of what we were able to put in.  Q2 also was our first shipping quarter for our M500 solution. The M500 started shipping in February of this year. We have seen great growth in the M500.  And just as a reminder, we released the M500 with 2 key AI capabilities, ALPR being one of them, and backseat passenger analytics being the second. This is a true AI platform, the M500 is, and we're going to be introducing more capabilities we have firmware upgrade into that platform as well. We think there's great potential there. This is Mahesh. I'd say that there's still stronger demand for the on-premises solution for 911 and CAD. Availability and reliability being some key factors that are involved there. That said, our call handling solutions combined with our heavy investment in smart transcription, which is a cloud-hosted AI solution; Citizen Input, which is also a cloud-hosted way of allowing citizens to have over-the-top video input and text input into PSAP as well for call handling, we're seeing significant traction in that space.  On CAD, hybrid capabilities become very important. We are seeing Aware -- CommandCentral Aware frequently attached with our CAD sales. And the other thing is emphasis on mobile. For LAPD, I mentioned CommandCentral Responder. The need for smartphone access to information in the field is becoming more and more important. And CommandCentral Responder, along with its many capabilities, really complements both our on-premise CAD and record solutions as well. So we see that hybrid really driving adoption for the key features that are best delivered in the cloud, along with the high available solutions that our 911 and CAD customers want."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. The presentation material and additional financial tables are posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a webcast replay of this call will be available on our website approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. You\u2019ll have an opportunity to ask questions after today\u2019s presentation. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to pass the conference over to Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, may begin your conference. \nTim Yocum: Welcome to our 2022 first quarter earnings call. With me today are, Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO. Greg and Jason will review our results, along with commentary and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A.  We posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call we reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during the during the conference call, in the Risk Factors section of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. \nGregory Brown: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook.  First, I'm really pleased with our strong start to the year, as we achieved sales and earnings per share above our guidance in spite of the challenging macroeconomic and supply chain environment that we continue to navigate. During the quarter we saw a record Q1 orders and record Q1 sales, highlighted by our video security and access control business, which grew 21% in revenue with even higher growth in orders. We also finished the quarter with a record Q1 ending backlog of $13.4 billion, up 19% versus last year.  Second, we continue to see strong demand across all three technologies, driven in part by a robust funding environment for our customers. In land mobile radio, we're seeing continued investment in regional, statewide and even countrywide networks that further reinforces the longevity and criticality of this technology. And in our higher growth areas of video and command center software, our investments in cloud and artificial intelligence are differentiating us from our competitors. Total software revenue was up 17% during the quarter, including 28% growth in software for our video security and access control business and 9% growth in command center software.  And finally, our expectation for full-year guidance remains unchanged. As the years progressed -- as this year has progressed, we've seen incremental headwinds related to higher freight costs, a stronger dollar and the dilutive impact to be Ava Security acquisition. However, these headwinds are being offset by further pricing actions, stronger demand, favorable mix and targeted cost reductions.  I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. \nJason Winkler: Thanks, Greg. Our Q1 results included revenue of $1.9 billion, up 7% and above our guidance, driven primarily by better than anticipated supply for LMR. Revenue from acquisitions was $17 million and currency headwinds were $18 million. GAAP operating earnings of $239 million and operating margins of 12.6% compared to 16.8% of sales in the year ago quarter.  Non-GAAP operating earnings of $374 million, down $37 million or 9% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 19.8% of sales, down from 23%. This decline in operating earnings was primarily due to the $50 million of higher semiconductor costs that we outlined on our last call, related to the acquiring critical supply in the secondary market for semiconductors. Additionally, we saw higher freight costs driven by elevated air freight rates and higher operating expenses related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher sales.  GAAP earnings per share of $1.54 compared to $1.41 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a deferred tax benefit in the current quarter related to the reorganization of intellectual property. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 per share compared to a $1.87 last year, a decrease primarily due to the operating earnings impact I described related to higher semiconductor and freight costs and increased operating expenses from acquisitions, partially offset by higher sales and a lower tax rate. OpEx in Q1 was $492 million, up $37 million versus last year, primarily due to higher expenses related to M&A, investments in video and higher selling costs commensurate with our higher sales.  Turning next to cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow was $152 million, compared with $370 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $98 million compared to $318 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to our planned increase in inventory as we invest to meet the strong product demand we're seeing from our customers in video and LMR.  Capital allocation for Q1 included $493 million in share repurchases, $134 million paid in cash dividends and $54 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter we closed the acquisitions of Ava Security for $387 million and TETRA Ireland for $120 million. And subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Calipsa, a leader in cloud-based advanced video analytics for $40 million. And just earlier today, we announced the acquisition of Videotec, a global supplier of pan-tilt-zoom and explosion proof cameras for $22 million. Videotec enhances our portfolio of NDAA compliant fixed video cameras.  Moving next to our segment results. Q1 Products and System Integration sales were $1.1 billion, up 9%, driven by anticipated strong growth in video and better supply availability in LMR. Revenue acquisition from acquisitions in the quarter was $7 million and currency headwinds were $8 million. Operating earnings were $96 million or 8.7% of sales, down from 12.9% in the prior year, driven by the $50 million of higher semiconductor costs and higher freight costs previously mentioned, partially offset by higher sales.  Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment include an over $60 million nationwide P25 order for Taiwan National Police, $20 million of P25 upgrade orders for Los Angeles, Unified School District, a $14 million TETRA upgrade for the Israeli railways, $11 million P25 expansion for a large US customer and a $5 million video order for a large US public school system.  Moving next to our Software and Services segment. Q1 revenue was $789 million, up 4% from last year. Revenue from acquisitions was $10 million and currency headwinds were also $10 million. Growth in this segment was driven by video security and command center software, while LMR services was approximately flat as expected due to the impact of a tough comp related to customers P25 system upgrades that were concentrated in the first quarter of 2021 due to the COVID delays throughout 2020 and the impact of unfavorable FX.  Operating earnings were $278 million or 35% of sales, down 170 basis points from last year, driven by a change in year-over-year mix and higher M&A operating expenses, partially offset by higher sales. For the full year we still expect software and services revenue growth of 10% and we expect operating margins that are comparable to last year with the dilutive impact of recent M&A offset by pricing and improved operating leverage.  Some notable Q1 highlights in this segment include $27 million command center software order for a customer in Latin America, a $20 million US federal multi-year service contract orders, $8 million command center software record management order for the City of Phoenix and an $8 million services agreement with the City of Chicago. During the quarter, we grew our video security and access control software revenue by 28%. And subsequent to the quarter end, we launched the Public Safety Threat Alliance, a cybersecurity information sharing and intelligence hub for the public safety community.  Looking next at our regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% and growth across all three technologies. International Q1 revenue was $587 million, flat versus last year with growth in video security and command center software, offset by a decline in LMR due to FX. We saw growth in Latin America and Asia-Pac, while Europe was slightly down, primarily due to FX.  Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $13.4 billion, up 19% or $2.1 billion compared to last year, driven by the Airwave extension recorded in the fourth quarter of \u201821 and increased demand across all three technologies. Sequentially backlog was down $115 million driven primarily by the Airwave and ESN revenue burn during the quarter, partially offset by growth in LMR and video products.  Software and -- Software and Services backlog was up $1.3 billion compared to last year, driven by the Airwave extension and a $320 million increase in multiyear services and software backlog in North America. Sequentially backlog was down $221 million or 2%, driven primarily by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN during the quarter and typical order seasonality in North America. Products and SI backlog was $852 million compared to last year and up $106 million sequentially, driven primarily by strong LMR and video demand in both regions.  We entered the year with a record backlog position and approximately $2.2 billion of our beginning backlog in the product segment was scheduled to be delivered in 2022 with over two-thirds of this amount expected to be delivered in the first half. We saw continued strong demand for new orders during the quarter with a record Q1 orders total that included comprehensive pricing actions we implemented across our portfolio in January. We expect these new orders at higher prices together with higher volumes in the second half to lead to a significant profitability ramp throughout the year.  Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up between 4% and 5% with non-GAAP EPS between $1.83 and $1.88 per share. This assumes approximately $50 million of FX headwinds, a diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22% to 23%. It also includes $50 million of year-over-year increased cost that we described on our last earnings call related to elevated material cost for semiconductor supply from secondary markets.  For the full year, we are maintaining our prior revenue guidance of 7% growth and non-GAAP EPS guidance between $9.80 and $9.95 per share despite the significant strengthening of the US dollar since our last call. We now expect FX to be a headwind of $170 million for the year, up $110 million from our prior guidance. This outlook now assumes a diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares based on the timing of our share repurchases in the year and an effective tax rate of 21% to 21.5%.  Additionally, our full year operating cash flow guidance for approximately $1.9 billion and full year OpEx expectations of approximately $100 million increase over last year are also unchanged, inclusive of the new acquisitions we announced, offset by targeted reductions we're making.  Before I turn the call back to Greg I wanted to reiterate some of the proactive measures we've been taking to navigate this dynamic environment. First, amid strong demand we've taken further pricing actions across various parts of our portfolio, which we expect to benefit our second half of the year. We remain cost disciplined with targeted OpEx cost planned, while funding our recent acquisitions. We are strategically investing in inventory to maximize the parts availability to fulfill the strong demand that we're seeing. And finally, we continue to be good stewards of capital, maintaining a strong balance sheet to be opportunistic and deploying capital on acquisitions and shareholder returns.  I would now like to turn the call back to Greg. \nGregory Brown: Thanks, Jason. I thought I would end with a few thoughts on the business. First, business remains really strong despite the ongoing macroeconomic and semiconductor challenges. We had record Q1 orders and sales that drove results above our expectations. We ended the quarter with our highest Q1 ending backlog ever and our higher growth businesses in video security and command center software continue to grow at a multiple of their overall markets.  Second, our healthy balance sheet and durable cash flow provides us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in our deployment of capital. During the quarter we closed two additional acquisitions I'm excited about TETRA Ireland, the provider of Ireland's nationwide digital radio service for first responders is a business. We've had our eye on for a while actually and it adds to our strong LMR managed services business, and Ava Security, a scalable, secure and flexible cloud solution provides customers with the benefits of an enterprise grade video security solution, while minimizing the physical footprint of their security infrastructure. Ava complements our on-prem offerings in fixed video security and provides us with the flexibility to meet our customers where they are with options for both cloud or on-prem solutions.  And finally, while the macroeconomic environment remains turbulent, I like our position. We're a leader in the markets we serve. We provide need to have solutions that are critical for customers. We continue to invest heavily in R&D, and all of this provides us with the ability to take continued pricing actions to manage higher cost pressures. Additionally, we have strong predictable cash flows that allows us to continue to invest in our growth businesses, while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.  I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. \nTim Yocum: Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question. \nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. \nKeith Housum: Good afternoon, guys. I appreciate the opportunity here. It sounds like you guys have been able to navigate the supply chain challenges fairly well. I know you got $50 million in extra cost for the first quarter, but can you guys talk about the supply visibility into supply for the rest of the year. Obviously, there have been a lot of upheaval, things going on at Shanghai recently, but any updated thoughts on where supply chain stands today? \nGregory Brown: Hey, Keith. I think our view of supply chain is, it's pretty much unchanged from where it was a quarter ago. It's still very challenging, we go through week by week negotiations and discussions with critical suppliers on allocations. On the good news side, I think we were more successful in Q1 getting some critical parts sooner than expected. And I think that drove an informed our over performance in Q1. The overall environment around semiconductor constraints remains challenging. I think, Keith, realistically we expect those challenges to exist throughout the rest of 2022. \nJason Winkler: And Keith, you mentioned the %50 million in Q1, it's another $50 million in Q2. So as we set out the year and described in the last call $100 million is elevated cost that we're incurring to buy these parts at a premium in the first half, but the second half is only $20 million, that's in part driven by the elevated costs that we faced last year with comp. But secondly, in terms of our supply and what our teams are doing to increase the number of substitutable parts, the engineering and quality teams are doing a good job in finding alternative parts and doing well in that. And we've also shifted to air as our primary means of freight, that's what's elevating our freight costs a little bit to get the parts in a timely fashion. \nGregory Brown: [Multiple Speakers] semiconductor constraint is largely unchanged. As Jason dimensionalize although freight is incrementally gotten worse as we shift more ocean to air and the overall cost is higher than was anticipated on our last call, but anticipated and included in our full year guidance. \nKeith Housum: Got you. Just as a follow-up, you guys had a really strong first quarter for bookings, is there the capability -- despite the challenges are you able to get enough supply to get over and above your guidance if the demand was there? \nGregory Brown: Our guidance for the quarter and the year is compilation of the demand and the match to the supply that we have and foresee in terms of delivery. So nothing has changed there. We overperformed in Q1, largely because we were able to get the supply and allocate it purposely to parts of the portfolio, like public safety that are important to customers, they also happen to have slightly higher ASPs. \nKeith Housum: Got you. Thanks guys. Good luck. \nGregory Brown: Thanks, Keith. \nOperator: Thank you, Keith. The next question is from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. You may proceed. \nGeorge Notter: Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I wanted to just quiz you on the full year guidance. You're keeping the 7%, but it seems like there is a lot of moving parts in there. And I'm just wondering how it all kind of nets out. So you have $110 million of additional FX headwinds, you've got a bunch of new M&A deals in here, pricing has gone up. I guess I'm wondering what it looks like when you kind of peel all that back? Is your guidance better or worse than maybe you thought three months ago? \nJason Winkler: You mentioned $110 million I FX, that's absolutely correct. The incremental M&A that's -- that we've acquired since we last talked is $60 million. Additionally \u2013 \nGregory Brown: Of net new revenue in the period. \nJason Winkler: Additionally, in terms of -- you mentioned price, we're absolutely looking at that and have made some changes across the portfolio. And the third item is, favorable mix. So what we -- where we prioritize and allocate our supply to. \nGregory Brown: We acquired Ava and Ava is about $0.10 dilutive to EPS for the full year. So net-net, we've got incremental headwinds as you talked about George of FX, incremental headwinds with freight, some M&A higher costs than our last call. But that's balanced out by favorable mix, particularly as we index toward higher tier shipments. We continue to take pricing actions. I think tax rate will be a little bit better and share count will be lower. So all in all -- and by the way, at the end of the day I think demand is as strong or maybe even stronger today than it was back in February. \nGeorge Notter: Got it. And then just continuing on that. Could you give us a sense for the magnitude of the pricing increases and I think you said January was the time you institutes those. Is that correct? And then, when do you think those will be fully in the model? \nJason Winkler: So we've been looking at price for a number of quarters, the most recent ones where January. I mentioned on the call that the backlog that we began the year with was $2.2 billion, that's largely going to fuel the first half. So the orders January onwards are going to fuel the second half and that's where our most recent pricing actions are. When I think about products, the segment in terms of what's driving the growth we expect this year for our product segment of mid-single digit growth. Within LMR the driver is largely price and mix favorability. And then within video, which is the higher growth part, it's price and volume that are driving the growth we expect there. \nGeorge Notter: Got it. All right. Super. Thank you very much. \nGregory Brown: Thanks, George. \nOperator: Thank you, George. The next question is from the line of Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is now open. Paul, please check the issue, you are now muted. \nPaul Silverstein: My apologies. Guys, I apologize if you answered this in your prepared remarks, but with the improvement in some of your key sectors in your professional inter-PCR business. Are you seeing that translates to an improved outlook. Hospitality has obviously improved significantly, oil and gas prices are up, albeit I'm not sure how much that's improved that industry, but are you seeing any improvement there? \nGregory Brown: So with PCR, we expect it to grow this year mid-single digits. it was flat in Q1. The demand for PCR is very robust, the limiting or gating item is supply around PCR. So Jack, if you want to talk about markets. \nJohn Molloy: Paul, I think that -- the two markets that we've seen the most profound rebound kind of post COVID have been air transportation and hospitalities. I think the next to follow will be commercial real estate as we get people back to work in major cities. We're starting to see upgrade even in our building. We'll see upgrades on the communications front there, but it's really been air and hospitality this year. \nPaul Silverstein: Yeah. For my follow-up, I appreciate you just increased prices, but everybody is citing stepped up component costs, any thoughts you can share on longer-term margins where they go and in what timeframe on the gross line. \nGregory Brown: Sure. So headline inflation we\u2019re navigating it like all companies and have been planning for a significant inflation number that we've been seeing. We have two cost inflation items that we believe are temporal. One, we're paying a premium for semiconductors that aren't available directly from the manufacturer and getting them through alternative secondary markets, that's a $120 million that is in the P&L this year as we get after that critical supply. Secondly, the freight levels that we're incurring this year, also air rates are frankly high, they got higher after the Ukraine invasion and they remain high. So those are two temporary items that we\u2019re navigating around, as well as general inflation. \nJason Winkler: Yeah. And Paul, I would also say that taking all those things into account, we still expect full year gross margins to be comparable for MSI and operating margins to be slightly up for full year 2022. \nPaul Silverstein: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, Paul. The next question is from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. \nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe starting, I noticed you guys talked about strong order activity kind of across the board, but just wanted to get a sense of was there any changes by region. So anything notable in the Europe region, maybe more specifically. Maybe I start with that and then I have a follow-up question. \nGregory Brown: Sure, Mata. I think as it replies to Europe. First of all, I just want to remind you, half of our revenue in Europe is actually recurring revenue, so think large scale managed service businesses. In Q1, internationally, we have been up 3% -- were up 3% in constant currency, so really the FX headwind that Jason alluded to really impacted Europe to the greatest extent. But I would say this, our challenges in Europe and really quite frankly in international are not demand related. Demand remains very robust, it remains very robust in Europe, not only in video security and access control, but our command center software as well as our land mobile business. So I think the biggest challenge I would say is really currency right now. \nJason Winkler: And Meta, just as a footnote, as it relates to Russia, contextually we've exited that market. It was pretty de minimis for us to begin with. Full year revenue on Russia last year was $25 million. So we've exited that market. We don't have Motorola Solutions employees in that theater any longer. So just as a footnote, I thought that could be helpful as well. \nMeta Marshall: Perfect. Very helpful. And then maybe just on the -- I just wanted to get a sense of you guys obviously spoke to growing backlog, just how much of the growing backlog is a result of supply chain challenges and inability to ship versus just some longer-term contracts coming in. Thanks. And that's it for me. \nGregory Brown: Majority of our backlog is from direct customers, governments, agencies, thousands of customers who order as their procurement cycles permit them. And so we believe that to be a very strong signal for their demand. We also have a channels business where channel inventories are very low and our channel partners are placing orders on us to replenish that inventory. So our demand signal from our -- both our direct customers and our indirect customers is pretty clean. And as Jack mentioned it is growing in both sides of the business. \nMeta Marshall: Perfect. Thanks. Congrats guys. \nGregory Brown: Thanks, Meta. \nOperator: Thank you, Meta. The next question is from the line of Sam Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. \nSami Badri: Great, thank you. I was hoping you could elaborate on our ARPA contribution. I know you guys put a couple of senses or sense in your press release, can you just walk us through contribution from explicitly ARPA that you guys are estimating. \nJohn Molloy: Hey, Sam, it's Jack. First of all, I want to -- we said it before, but it's important to first of all point out this, ARPA will be a multi-year phenomenon. So our team is actually -- whey we look at our pipeline, which is our sales funnel, we've actually seen the three time increase over this period last year. So that's great. And a lot of that is really directed at the $350 billion in state and local, which really -- we've never had a problem as it relates to where we needs to have business, but what it really does, it draws clarity to how those deals get funded. And so we'll be in that for the next 2.5, three years.  The second area where it's been very helpful is with our fixed video security and access control business, particularly around the education vertical where people are really trying to -- as they bring kids back to school, trying to make sure those places are safe. Actually investing in things like concealed weapons technology with our evolved partnership as well. So we think the money, at this point, which is $170 billion there will also be -- will benefit us over the course of the next three years as well. \nSami Badri: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, maybe for you Jack again. Any update on body worn camera or fixed cameras that go on to the vehicles like first responder vehicles. Could you give us an update on that and growth rates or any kind of comments on market share? \nJohn Molloy: Absolutely. So first of all, as it relates to -- as it relates to the body worn. I talked about last year from a market share context, last year we doubled our orders, in 2021 doubled our orders in a market that certainly didn't double. So we felt like we took share. As it relates to Q1 2022, our orders were up double-digit. And I think most importantly there were up double-digit against a comp, whereby last year we grew 65% in orders in Q2.  And I think the only thing I'd add is, we announced our as a service offer last year, we've actually seen acceleration in customers' willingness to choose the cloud there. So, we've said before, we think that the market wants an alternative. We've got good relationships internationally and in North America our team continues to fight for their fair share. \nGregory Brown: Let me just add to that [Multiple Speakers] we launched the M500 last year, it started shipping a few months ago, a little bit earlier this year. The M500 we consider to be a significant leap up from our prior generation [Ferrari] (ph). And it builds upon a lot of the goodness that the Ferrari had and Ferrari from the WatchGuard legacy really has evolved with a lot of customer feedback. Critically for the M500 we have added some significant new AI capabilities. This is a platform that's really meant to deliver AI capabilities. At launch we launched it with two capabilities effectively officer and passenger safety, but in addition ALPR as well. And the ALPR stream actually contributes to the other sets of ALPR cameras we have in our portfolio. These feed into one of the largest -- the industry's largest license plate databases that we have. Right now we're exceeding $50 billion of plate rates.  And to give you an idea of, like the rate at which it gets refreshed, in Q1 of this year we accounted for about $2.4 billion plate rate and to give you understanding of the frequency at which we are growing here compared to the previous year, we doubled the plate rate. So overall from a mobile video standpoint and in ALPR standpoint we're doing fantastic. \nSami Badri: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you, Sami. The next question is from the line of Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. \nBen Bollin: Thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon, everyone. The first question, I was hoping you could share any thoughts around customer priorities with respect to command center software and refresh? And just talk to any execution you're seeing. How you think you're doing? How it's developing? Kind of where it's going? And then I had a follow-up to Greg. \nJohn Molloy: Sure. So the first point is that, we are growing fast then the market, we're taking market share. Over half of our orders last quarter in Q1 were suite orders, effectively we either added on to existing bundles for we -- customers bought more than one. And Jason mentioned two of our larger opportunities, it is bit. The LA Unified School District they bought our CAD and record solution, but not only are we seeing synergies now with our software suite, but one of the key reasons to buy there was location data integration from our LMR side as well. And that had a profound impact in that opportunity.  The City of Phoenix opportunity that Jason mentioned was driven by the national Incident based reporting criteria that the city needed to comply with. And that along with the fact that we are now integrating with the Aware solution for real-time situational awareness, that added a lot of synergy to that opportunity as well. We had our Summits in April and the summit was the largest Software Summit we have ever had in Motorola history. 1,600 attendees, over 300 classes and user group sessions, we had representation across all user types going from call to case closure. There is some important themes that we hit there. The first with the fortification team and really what resonated there was cybersecurity.  We talked about the public safety threat alliance that we launched quite recently and as a consequence of us talking about the public safety threat alliance, within the first two weeks of the creation of it we've had over 50 members sign up to be part of that and we expect that to rapidly increase. We also talked extensively about our innovations in user experience given the theses, given the user that were represented there and some of the -- as an example, some of the AI capabilities that we talked about there really resonated with our customers.  Smart transcription is something that we have talked about previously, but smart transcription has become more than just a transcription -- speech to text transcription, but it really has become and application platform for us that we have built alongside our customers. So not only is transcription a second pair of ears that make sure that the call taker doesn't miss anything. We have now been able to add capabilities where smart transcription allows the call taker to benefit from the experience of other callers who have responded to similar sorts of events.  So, to be able to search for similar calls that they have -- others have responded to and for them to be better informed in responding to new types of event, so smart transcription has actually become an experienced base for existing customers. On top of that, based upon customer feedback we've added capabilities for supervisors to know when to support a call taker during the call as well.  And lastly, we're also extending this to now recognizing when call takers are under stress. So these smart transcription has the capability, it has really expanded our capacity to add applications for our command center software suite. And the last part that I'll mention here is that, mobile has become a significant part of what we have talked about as well. We've invested heavily in mobile CC responder, command center responder has now both in iOS and Android instance supporting our on-prem and our cloud installs, hybrid being a key priority there. And with our customer in Western Australia, we recently launched a CarPlay application that was done in collaboration with Apple and the Western Australia police and this is the very first public safety application to be launched for CarPlay. All of this, by the way very much consistent with our hybrid strategy and we're seeing a fair amount of traction there. \nBen Bollin: That's great. Thanks for that color that. Follow-up for you, Greg. When you step back and kind of look at the world and clearly we are is a surplus demand environment. And at some point supply starts to catch up, but I'm interested in how you think about monitoring the inbound orders and ensuring that customers are running out there and placing a lot of orders, may be with multiple vendors, perhaps ordering more than they need and just kind of taking what comes first. How do you think about that? Obviously, I think it's more PCR related, but just curious, any thoughts you have there? And that\u2019s it from me. Thank you. \nGregory Brown: Ben, I was just going to say the last part that you said. I think it is more PCR related. I think the way we do that is, I think Molloy and John Zidar during this time work really closely with the channel partners, particularly in North America on prioritization, on active conversations, on transparency, on what they really need versus what they may think they want, to try to eliminate any kind of artificial forecasting. So I think it's a reflection of the relationships we have with the channel partners. And I have to tip my hat to John Zidar who runs that organization under Molloy.  I think the way you sort through that is the efficacy and the authenticity of the conversations with the partners during these tough times. And I think Molloy and his team are doing that. \nJohn Molloy: Correct. The only thing I'd add to that is, I mean, you're right, the PCR channel -- by the way, it's also important to note that a lot of our partners carry one brand. So they're not putting orders against the second one. The second thing is government customers don't have the wherewithal, meaning, they have a limited budget, they're not able to cut multiple purchase orders against the same budget line item. So we wouldn't have any inflation in orders on there, there is an end customer within, for instance, Cook County. If it's a highway department or the sheriff's department, they've got line item 32, it\u2019s $1 million, they can spend that twice. So we know that there is clarity of funding there. \nBen Bollin: Thanks. \nGregory Brown: Thanks, Ben. \nOperator: Thank you, Ben. The next question is from Fahad Najam with Loop Capital. Your line is now open. \nFahad Najam: Thank you for taking my question. I had two clarifications first, before I can get to my question. What was the FX headwind in the quarter? And also you highlighted, about $170 million in FX headwinds in the revenue, but what's the -- I'm assuming there is a benefit to the OpEx line. So can you maybe tell us what benefit you're seeing on the OpEx from the FX. \nJason Winkler: So the answer to the first question is, within the quarter it was $18 million in FX and on FX in general, we have some offsets within OpEx to mitigate the effects of the gross margin dollars lost. So there is some relief, if you will, on OpEx. But in total, $110 million degradation in -- from last call to this call comes with an OE impact that we are mitigating through price, through cost targets and through allocation to higher mix. \nFahad Najam: Got it. I wanted to ask you on the component shortages, maybe if you can double click on that and maybe provide us a color on what has improved, what has not improved, what gotten worse? Maybe you could give us a bit of clarity on what your line of sight is. You are clearly thinking that things will improve, but can you just give us a color on what portfolio is getting most impacted by component shortages? \nJohn Molloy: Yeah. Fahad, I would say as it relates to semiconductor constraints, because that's really what we're referring to. I don't think we see it improving. I think we see it as a constant challenge throughout the remainder of 2022. What improved in Q1 was successfully navigating and negotiating and get some -- getting some increased allocation on some key parts with some key suppliers that moved it from Q2 into Q1. That allowed us to over perform the way we did top and bottom in Q1. I would say that semiconductor constraint environment remains unchanged, i.e., still challenging. We think it will be through the remainder of the year. It is primarily around land mobile radio, but quite frankly video security is not immune completely either, but we are managing those accordingly. \nFahad Najam: Within the LMR portfolio are you seeing more adverse impact on your higher margin PCR and LMR -- APX NEXT portfolio, just kind of color on what within your LMR portfolio is been more adversely impact or what is all universal. \nJohn Molloy: I think the, part of the LMR, that's the most challenge with PCR, because we have a lot of common semiconductor parts that go into all types of radios. So we are working closely with customers around favorable mix, in particular, North America and oftentimes higher tier devices that allow us to ship those and fulfill those orders quicker than others. So the main part of the LMR portfolio. I think that feels it the most acutely is probably PCR. \nGregory Brown: The only thing I'd add on the high tier and APX. APX NEXT is the complexity of those products and the joint engineering we do, and the supply lines we have for semiconductors are unique to those products and we're doing a good job in getting the security of that supply lines. So there are some commonalities, but also some uniqueness in our key suppliers and public safety LMR are doing a good job of getting us what we need. \nFahad Najam: I appreciate the answer. Thank you. \nGregory Brown: Thank you. Fahad. \nOperator: Thank you, Fahad. The next question is from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is now open. \nLouie DiPalma: Greg, Jason, Jack and Mahesh, good afternoon from sunny Chicago. \nGregory Brown: Louie, how you doing? \nLouie DiPalma: Doing great. Thank you for taking my question. The William Blair team heard very positive commentary about Openpath solutions at the Commercial Real Estate Tech Conference in San Diego. So I was wondering, can you discuss your growth strategy for access control in general? And also I wanted to note that during the quarter it seem that Stanley saw that access technologies division for $900 million and related to your strategy do you expect to be as active with access control and acquisitions as you have been with video acquisitions? Thanks. \nGregory Brown: Okay. Louie, I'll start and Mahesh may want to color in some lines. I think first of all, as it relates to fixed video, security and access control, we've taken a premise and a look at the market to say we want to make sure we meet our customers' for where they are. So it started with Avigilon, which is an on-prem end-to-end solution. We've invested in Avigilon cloud services, but they had a legacy Access Control business as well. Actually that business was actually the highest growth within the Avigilon portfolio one point in time, but we really saw a move to cloud and mobility, particularly as people want -- they want smartphones capability to access a building instead of an old keycard. And well, I would also tell you that Openpath is seen -- it's been -- it outkicked it business case due to the fact that there is a shortage on card readers right now, like a lot of things in the heart. So that's really accelerated the growth into the cloud for Openpath. So I think you will hear a lot of good things.  The other piece with Openpath as I said is its cloud. native, which is different to the most. So we think we've got a pretty good strategy as it relates to both in terms of a buyer wants to cloud solution or Openpath. I mean, now the cloud solution are an on-prem solution. Mahesh, anything you want to add to that. \nMahesh Saptharishi: Yeah. I think the Openpath team launched a video intercom reader in Q1 as well and that's sort of is a signal in terms of the convergence between video and access control more broadly. If you look at the architecture of Openpath cloud native with endpoints on friend like readers, but also the ability to tackle existing leaders, support that migration from on-prem to cloud. Ava is a very similar model as well where it can be either entirely cloud native or support a mix in between as well. The combination of Ava and Openpath gives us the opportunity to convert many of the security and access control use cases and expand that ecosystem. So we see a strong solution there that's end to end for security needs. \nLouie DiPalma: Great. That's perfect. That's it from me. Thanks everyone. \nGregory Brown: Thanks, Louis. \nOperator: Thank you, Louie. The next question is from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. \nJim Suva: Thank you. A question for Greg. Greg, on your prepared comments you mentioned improved funding, is that coming from the stimulus plans or from property taxes? And the reason why I ask is, a lot of property taxes or at least while I am here in Silicon Valley, California they reassessed each year. So people are kind of bracing for a big property tax inflow maybe in six or nine months from -- a big property tax hit in six or 12 months from now. So I would assume that a lot of your budgets are more to stimulus but -- or maybe travel and tourism improving as opposed to real estate property taxes. And if so, does that mean that there is still kind of a second round of improved funding that's coming in. \nJohn Molloy: Yeah. Hey, Jim, it's Jack. Maybe I'll take that one. So we look at -- if you remember, there's really three primary budgets excluding federal stimulus and those are operating expense budgets that our annualized. So those things pay for things like maintenance, replacement of radios, those kinds of things. That's the first piece of it. The second of which is actually 911 funding. So a lot of the portfolio are command center software budgets, those get set and those monies are allocated in a different way. So it's a different funding stream. The third, as you said, our real estate and property taxes. There is more of an ebb and flow to those things and quite frankly, historically, we don't see a big uptick in those things, because public safety [indiscernible] nice to have, those are prioritized in annual basis and it's really capital or operating expense and it's 911. Now what's really benefited us, as I pointed out earlier and you heard Greg and his prepared remarks is a $350 billion for state and local and $170 billion directed at schools. Those are new funding that's created new opportunities in all aspects of our portfolio. \nGregory Brown: In terms of state and local budget cycles. I'll remind everyone we have thousands of customers in North America. A common changeover in year is around July 1. So they will look at available funds and as well as stimulus and set their priorities. So we'll see what those budgets look like, but all indications are with the backstop of funding that will continue. \nJohn Molloy: To get real technical, there is also something -- there is also spot taxes, which are specialized purchase things and they do special taxes and raise money per county wide systems as well, that\u2019s the only kind of one-off. \nJim Suva: Great. Thank you so much for the details and clarifications. Congratulations.  Thank you, Jim. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks. \nGregory Brown: Yeah. I just want to close -- Thank you for that opportunity. I want to close by thanking all of the Motorola Solutions people around the world for their commitment, perseverance in what was a strong Q1. Despite the fluid and dynamic environment demand, it just remains exceptionally strong. The customer funding environment remains robust. We continue to make investments in software and video. And as Jason and others outlined in this call, we continue to take action to offset higher costs.  I would just say this, macroeconomic turbulence and uncertainty presents opportunity and we will continue to deploy capital against the backdrop of those opportunities that present themselves. Thank you for joining us. We look forward to talking to you again in a few months. And again to all the Motorola people, thank you, thank you, thank you. Much appreciated. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the Internet in approximately two hours. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. We thank you for your participation, and ask you please disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Our Q1 results included revenue of $1.9 billion, up 7% and above our guidance, driven primarily by better than anticipated supply for LMR. Revenue from acquisitions was $17 million and currency headwinds were $18 million. GAAP operating earnings of $239 million and operating margins of 12.6% compared to 16.8% of sales in the year ago quarter.  Non-GAAP operating earnings of $374 million, down $37 million or 9% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margins of 19.8% of sales, down from 23%. This decline in operating earnings was primarily due to the $50 million of higher semiconductor costs that we outlined on our last call, related to the acquiring critical supply in the secondary market for semiconductors. Additionally, we saw higher freight costs driven by elevated air freight rates and higher operating expenses related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher sales.  GAAP earnings per share of $1.54 compared to $1.41 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a deferred tax benefit in the current quarter related to the reorganization of intellectual property. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 per share compared to a $1.87 last year, a decrease primarily due to the operating earnings impact I described related to higher semiconductor and freight costs and increased operating expenses from acquisitions, partially offset by higher sales and a lower tax rate. OpEx in Q1 was $492 million, up $37 million versus last year, primarily due to higher expenses related to M&A, investments in video and higher selling costs commensurate with our higher sales.  Turning next to cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow was $152 million, compared with $370 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $98 million compared to $318 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash flow was primarily due to our planned increase in inventory as we invest to meet the strong product demand we're seeing from our customers in video and LMR.  Capital allocation for Q1 included $493 million in share repurchases, $134 million paid in cash dividends and $54 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter we closed the acquisitions of Ava Security for $387 million and TETRA Ireland for $120 million. And subsequent to quarter end, we acquired Calipsa, a leader in cloud-based advanced video analytics for $40 million. And just earlier today, we announced the acquisition of Videotec, a global supplier of pan-tilt-zoom and explosion proof cameras for $22 million. Videotec enhances our portfolio of NDAA compliant fixed video cameras.  Moving next to our segment results. Q1 Products and System Integration sales were $1.1 billion, up 9%, driven by anticipated strong growth in video and better supply availability in LMR. Revenue acquisition from acquisitions in the quarter was $7 million and currency headwinds were $8 million. Operating earnings were $96 million or 8.7% of sales, down from 12.9% in the prior year, driven by the $50 million of higher semiconductor costs and higher freight costs previously mentioned, partially offset by higher sales.  Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment include an over $60 million nationwide P25 order for Taiwan National Police, $20 million of P25 upgrade orders for Los Angeles, Unified School District, a $14 million TETRA upgrade for the Israeli railways, $11 million P25 expansion for a large US customer and a $5 million video order for a large US public school system.  Moving next to our Software and Services segment. Q1 revenue was $789 million, up 4% from last year. Revenue from acquisitions was $10 million and currency headwinds were also $10 million. Growth in this segment was driven by video security and command center software, while LMR services was approximately flat as expected due to the impact of a tough comp related to customers P25 system upgrades that were concentrated in the first quarter of 2021 due to the COVID delays throughout 2020 and the impact of unfavorable FX.  Operating earnings were $278 million or 35% of sales, down 170 basis points from last year, driven by a change in year-over-year mix and higher M&A operating expenses, partially offset by higher sales. For the full year we still expect software and services revenue growth of 10% and we expect operating margins that are comparable to last year with the dilutive impact of recent M&A offset by pricing and improved operating leverage.  Some notable Q1 highlights in this segment include $27 million command center software order for a customer in Latin America, a $20 million US federal multi-year service contract orders, $8 million command center software record management order for the City of Phoenix and an $8 million services agreement with the City of Chicago. During the quarter, we grew our video security and access control software revenue by 28%. And subsequent to the quarter end, we launched the Public Safety Threat Alliance, a cybersecurity information sharing and intelligence hub for the public safety community.  Looking next at our regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% and growth across all three technologies. International Q1 revenue was $587 million, flat versus last year with growth in video security and command center software, offset by a decline in LMR due to FX. We saw growth in Latin America and Asia-Pac, while Europe was slightly down, primarily due to FX.  Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $13.4 billion, up 19% or $2.1 billion compared to last year, driven by the Airwave extension recorded in the fourth quarter of \u201821 and increased demand across all three technologies. Sequentially backlog was down $115 million driven primarily by the Airwave and ESN revenue burn during the quarter, partially offset by growth in LMR and video products.  Software and -- Software and Services backlog was up $1.3 billion compared to last year, driven by the Airwave extension and a $320 million increase in multiyear services and software backlog in North America. Sequentially backlog was down $221 million or 2%, driven primarily by revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN during the quarter and typical order seasonality in North America. Products and SI backlog was $852 million compared to last year and up $106 million sequentially, driven primarily by strong LMR and video demand in both regions.  We entered the year with a record backlog position and approximately $2.2 billion of our beginning backlog in the product segment was scheduled to be delivered in 2022 with over two-thirds of this amount expected to be delivered in the first half. We saw continued strong demand for new orders during the quarter with a record Q1 orders total that included comprehensive pricing actions we implemented across our portfolio in January. We expect these new orders at higher prices together with higher volumes in the second half to lead to a significant profitability ramp throughout the year.  Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up between 4% and 5% with non-GAAP EPS between $1.83 and $1.88 per share. This assumes approximately $50 million of FX headwinds, a diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of 22% to 23%. It also includes $50 million of year-over-year increased cost that we described on our last earnings call related to elevated material cost for semiconductor supply from secondary markets.  For the full year, we are maintaining our prior revenue guidance of 7% growth and non-GAAP EPS guidance between $9.80 and $9.95 per share despite the significant strengthening of the US dollar since our last call. We now expect FX to be a headwind of $170 million for the year, up $110 million from our prior guidance. This outlook now assumes a diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares based on the timing of our share repurchases in the year and an effective tax rate of 21% to 21.5%.  Additionally, our full year operating cash flow guidance for approximately $1.9 billion and full year OpEx expectations of approximately $100 million increase over last year are also unchanged, inclusive of the new acquisitions we announced, offset by targeted reductions we're making.  Before I turn the call back to Greg I wanted to reiterate some of the proactive measures we've been taking to navigate this dynamic environment. First, amid strong demand we've taken further pricing actions across various parts of our portfolio, which we expect to benefit our second half of the year. We remain cost disciplined with targeted OpEx cost planned, while funding our recent acquisitions. We are strategically investing in inventory to maximize the parts availability to fulfill the strong demand that we're seeing. And finally, we continue to be good stewards of capital, maintaining a strong balance sheet to be opportunistic and deploying capital on acquisitions and shareholder returns.  I would now like to turn the call back to Greg. And Keith, you mentioned the %50 million in Q1, it's another $50 million in Q2. So as we set out the year and described in the last call $100 million is elevated cost that we're incurring to buy these parts at a premium in the first half, but the second half is only $20 million, that's in part driven by the elevated costs that we faced last year with comp. But secondly, in terms of our supply and what our teams are doing to increase the number of substitutable parts, the engineering and quality teams are doing a good job in finding alternative parts and doing well in that. And we've also shifted to air as our primary means of freight, that's what's elevating our freight costs a little bit to get the parts in a timely fashion. You mentioned $110 million I FX, that's absolutely correct. The incremental M&A that's -- that we've acquired since we last talked is $60 million. Additionally \u2013 Additionally, in terms of -- you mentioned price, we're absolutely looking at that and have made some changes across the portfolio. And the third item is, favorable mix. So what we -- where we prioritize and allocate our supply to. So we've been looking at price for a number of quarters, the most recent ones where January. I mentioned on the call that the backlog that we began the year with was $2.2 billion, that's largely going to fuel the first half. So the orders January onwards are going to fuel the second half and that's where our most recent pricing actions are. When I think about products, the segment in terms of what's driving the growth we expect this year for our product segment of mid-single digit growth. Within LMR the driver is largely price and mix favorability. And then within video, which is the higher growth part, it's price and volume that are driving the growth we expect there. Yeah. And Paul, I would also say that taking all those things into account, we still expect full year gross margins to be comparable for MSI and operating margins to be slightly up for full year 2022. And Meta, just as a footnote, as it relates to Russia, contextually we've exited that market. It was pretty de minimis for us to begin with. Full year revenue on Russia last year was $25 million. So we've exited that market. We don't have Motorola Solutions employees in that theater any longer. So just as a footnote, I thought that could be helpful as well. So the answer to the first question is, within the quarter it was $18 million in FX and on FX in general, we have some offsets within OpEx to mitigate the effects of the gross margin dollars lost. So there is some relief, if you will, on OpEx. But in total, $110 million degradation in -- from last call to this call comes with an OE impact that we are mitigating through price, through cost targets and through allocation to higher mix."

            "name": "John Molloy",
            "content": "Paul, I think that -- the two markets that we've seen the most profound rebound kind of post COVID have been air transportation and hospitalities. I think the next to follow will be commercial real estate as we get people back to work in major cities. We're starting to see upgrade even in our building. We'll see upgrades on the communications front there, but it's really been air and hospitality this year. Hey, Sam, it's Jack. First of all, I want to -- we said it before, but it's important to first of all point out this, ARPA will be a multi-year phenomenon. So our team is actually -- whey we look at our pipeline, which is our sales funnel, we've actually seen the three time increase over this period last year. So that's great. And a lot of that is really directed at the $350 billion in state and local, which really -- we've never had a problem as it relates to where we needs to have business, but what it really does, it draws clarity to how those deals get funded. And so we'll be in that for the next 2.5, three years.  The second area where it's been very helpful is with our fixed video security and access control business, particularly around the education vertical where people are really trying to -- as they bring kids back to school, trying to make sure those places are safe. Actually investing in things like concealed weapons technology with our evolved partnership as well. So we think the money, at this point, which is $170 billion there will also be -- will benefit us over the course of the next three years as well. Absolutely. So first of all, as it relates to -- as it relates to the body worn. I talked about last year from a market share context, last year we doubled our orders, in 2021 doubled our orders in a market that certainly didn't double. So we felt like we took share. As it relates to Q1 2022, our orders were up double-digit. And I think most importantly there were up double-digit against a comp, whereby last year we grew 65% in orders in Q2.  And I think the only thing I'd add is, we announced our as a service offer last year, we've actually seen acceleration in customers' willingness to choose the cloud there. So, we've said before, we think that the market wants an alternative. We've got good relationships internationally and in North America our team continues to fight for their fair share. Sure. So the first point is that, we are growing fast then the market, we're taking market share. Over half of our orders last quarter in Q1 were suite orders, effectively we either added on to existing bundles for we -- customers bought more than one. And Jason mentioned two of our larger opportunities, it is bit. The LA Unified School District they bought our CAD and record solution, but not only are we seeing synergies now with our software suite, but one of the key reasons to buy there was location data integration from our LMR side as well. And that had a profound impact in that opportunity.  The City of Phoenix opportunity that Jason mentioned was driven by the national Incident based reporting criteria that the city needed to comply with. And that along with the fact that we are now integrating with the Aware solution for real-time situational awareness, that added a lot of synergy to that opportunity as well. We had our Summits in April and the summit was the largest Software Summit we have ever had in Motorola history. 1,600 attendees, over 300 classes and user group sessions, we had representation across all user types going from call to case closure. There is some important themes that we hit there. The first with the fortification team and really what resonated there was cybersecurity.  We talked about the public safety threat alliance that we launched quite recently and as a consequence of us talking about the public safety threat alliance, within the first two weeks of the creation of it we've had over 50 members sign up to be part of that and we expect that to rapidly increase. We also talked extensively about our innovations in user experience given the theses, given the user that were represented there and some of the -- as an example, some of the AI capabilities that we talked about there really resonated with our customers.  Smart transcription is something that we have talked about previously, but smart transcription has become more than just a transcription -- speech to text transcription, but it really has become and application platform for us that we have built alongside our customers. So not only is transcription a second pair of ears that make sure that the call taker doesn't miss anything. We have now been able to add capabilities where smart transcription allows the call taker to benefit from the experience of other callers who have responded to similar sorts of events.  So, to be able to search for similar calls that they have -- others have responded to and for them to be better informed in responding to new types of event, so smart transcription has actually become an experienced base for existing customers. On top of that, based upon customer feedback we've added capabilities for supervisors to know when to support a call taker during the call as well.  And lastly, we're also extending this to now recognizing when call takers are under stress. So these smart transcription has the capability, it has really expanded our capacity to add applications for our command center software suite. And the last part that I'll mention here is that, mobile has become a significant part of what we have talked about as well. We've invested heavily in mobile CC responder, command center responder has now both in iOS and Android instance supporting our on-prem and our cloud installs, hybrid being a key priority there. And with our customer in Western Australia, we recently launched a CarPlay application that was done in collaboration with Apple and the Western Australia police and this is the very first public safety application to be launched for CarPlay. All of this, by the way very much consistent with our hybrid strategy and we're seeing a fair amount of traction there. Correct. The only thing I'd add to that is, I mean, you're right, the PCR channel -- by the way, it's also important to note that a lot of our partners carry one brand. So they're not putting orders against the second one. The second thing is government customers don't have the wherewithal, meaning, they have a limited budget, they're not able to cut multiple purchase orders against the same budget line item. So we wouldn't have any inflation in orders on there, there is an end customer within, for instance, Cook County. If it's a highway department or the sheriff's department, they've got line item 32, it's $1 million, they can spend that twice. So we know that there is clarity of funding there. Yeah. Fahad, I would say as it relates to semiconductor constraints, because that's really what we're referring to. I don't think we see it improving. I think we see it as a constant challenge throughout the remainder of 2022. What improved in Q1 was successfully navigating and negotiating and get some -- getting some increased allocation on some key parts with some key suppliers that moved it from Q2 into Q1. That allowed us to over perform the way we did top and bottom in Q1. I would say that semiconductor constraint environment remains unchanged, i.e., still challenging. We think it will be through the remainder of the year. It is primarily around land mobile radio, but quite frankly video security is not immune completely either, but we are managing those accordingly. I think the, part of the LMR, that's the most challenge with PCR, because we have a lot of common semiconductor parts that go into all types of radios. So we are working closely with customers around favorable mix, in particular, North America and oftentimes higher tier devices that allow us to ship those and fulfill those orders quicker than others. So the main part of the LMR portfolio. I think that feels it the most acutely is probably PCR. Yeah. Hey, Jim, it's Jack. Maybe I'll take that one. So we look at -- if you remember, there's really three primary budgets excluding federal stimulus and those are operating expense budgets that our annualized. So those things pay for things like maintenance, replacement of radios, those kinds of things. That's the first piece of it. The second of which is actually 911 funding. So a lot of the portfolio are command center software budgets, those get set and those monies are allocated in a different way. So it's a different funding stream. The third, as you said, our real estate and property taxes. There is more of an ebb and flow to those things and quite frankly, historically, we don't see a big uptick in those things, because public safety [indiscernible] nice to have, those are prioritized in annual basis and it's really capital or operating expense and it's 911. Now what's really benefited us, as I pointed out earlier and you heard Greg and his prepared remarks is a $350 billion for state and local and $170 billion directed at schools. Those are new funding that's created new opportunities in all aspects of our portfolio. To get real technical, there is also something -- there is also spot taxes, which are specialized purchase things and they do special taxes and raise money per county wide systems as well, that's the only kind of one-off."

            "name": "Gregory Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook.  First, I'm really pleased with our strong start to the year, as we achieved sales and earnings per share above our guidance in spite of the challenging macroeconomic and supply chain environment that we continue to navigate. During the quarter we saw a record Q1 orders and record Q1 sales, highlighted by our video security and access control business, which grew 21% in revenue with even higher growth in orders. We also finished the quarter with a record Q1 ending backlog of $13.4 billion, up 19% versus last year.  Second, we continue to see strong demand across all three technologies, driven in part by a robust funding environment for our customers. In land mobile radio, we're seeing continued investment in regional, statewide and even countrywide networks that further reinforces the longevity and criticality of this technology. And in our higher growth areas of video and command center software, our investments in cloud and artificial intelligence are differentiating us from our competitors. Total software revenue was up 17% during the quarter, including 28% growth in software for our video security and access control business and 9% growth in command center software.  And finally, our expectation for full-year guidance remains unchanged. As the years progressed -- as this year has progressed, we've seen incremental headwinds related to higher freight costs, a stronger dollar and the dilutive impact to be Ava Security acquisition. However, these headwinds are being offset by further pricing actions, stronger demand, favorable mix and targeted cost reductions.  I'll now turn the call over to Jason to take you through our results and outlook before returning for some final thoughts. Thanks, Jason. I thought I would end with a few thoughts on the business. First, business remains really strong despite the ongoing macroeconomic and semiconductor challenges. We had record Q1 orders and sales that drove results above our expectations. We ended the quarter with our highest Q1 ending backlog ever and our higher growth businesses in video security and command center software continue to grow at a multiple of their overall markets.  Second, our healthy balance sheet and durable cash flow provides us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in our deployment of capital. During the quarter we closed two additional acquisitions I'm excited about TETRA Ireland, the provider of Ireland's nationwide digital radio service for first responders is a business. We've had our eye on for a while actually and it adds to our strong LMR managed services business, and Ava Security, a scalable, secure and flexible cloud solution provides customers with the benefits of an enterprise grade video security solution, while minimizing the physical footprint of their security infrastructure. Ava complements our on-prem offerings in fixed video security and provides us with the flexibility to meet our customers where they are with options for both cloud or on-prem solutions.  And finally, while the macroeconomic environment remains turbulent, I like our position. We're a leader in the markets we serve. We provide need to have solutions that are critical for customers. We continue to invest heavily in R&D, and all of this provides us with the ability to take continued pricing actions to manage higher cost pressures. Additionally, we have strong predictable cash flows that allows us to continue to invest in our growth businesses, while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.  I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Hey, Keith. I think our view of supply chain is, it's pretty much unchanged from where it was a quarter ago. It's still very challenging, we go through week by week negotiations and discussions with critical suppliers on allocations. On the good news side, I think we were more successful in Q1 getting some critical parts sooner than expected. And I think that drove an informed our over performance in Q1. The overall environment around semiconductor constraints remains challenging. I think, Keith, realistically we expect those challenges to exist throughout the rest of 2022. [Multiple Speakers] semiconductor constraint is largely unchanged. As Jason dimensionalize although freight is incrementally gotten worse as we shift more ocean to air and the overall cost is higher than was anticipated on our last call, but anticipated and included in our full year guidance. Our guidance for the quarter and the year is compilation of the demand and the match to the supply that we have and foresee in terms of delivery. So nothing has changed there. We overperformed in Q1, largely because we were able to get the supply and allocate it purposely to parts of the portfolio, like public safety that are important to customers, they also happen to have slightly higher ASPs. Thanks, Keith. Of net new revenue in the period. We acquired Ava and Ava is about $0.10 dilutive to EPS for the full year. So net-net, we've got incremental headwinds as you talked about George of FX, incremental headwinds with freight, some M&A higher costs than our last call. But that's balanced out by favorable mix, particularly as we index toward higher tier shipments. We continue to take pricing actions. I think tax rate will be a little bit better and share count will be lower. So all in all -- and by the way, at the end of the day I think demand is as strong or maybe even stronger today than it was back in February. Thanks, George. So with PCR, we expect it to grow this year mid-single digits. it was flat in Q1. The demand for PCR is very robust, the limiting or gating item is supply around PCR. So Jack, if you want to talk about markets. Sure. So headline inflation we're navigating it like all companies and have been planning for a significant inflation number that we've been seeing. We have two cost inflation items that we believe are temporal. One, we're paying a premium for semiconductors that aren't available directly from the manufacturer and getting them through alternative secondary markets, that's a $120 million that is in the P&L this year as we get after that critical supply. Secondly, the freight levels that we're incurring this year, also air rates are frankly high, they got higher after the Ukraine invasion and they remain high. So those are two temporary items that we're navigating around, as well as general inflation. Sure, Mata. I think as it replies to Europe. First of all, I just want to remind you, half of our revenue in Europe is actually recurring revenue, so think large scale managed service businesses. In Q1, internationally, we have been up 3% -- were up 3% in constant currency, so really the FX headwind that Jason alluded to really impacted Europe to the greatest extent. But I would say this, our challenges in Europe and really quite frankly in international are not demand related. Demand remains very robust, it remains very robust in Europe, not only in video security and access control, but our command center software as well as our land mobile business. So I think the biggest challenge I would say is really currency right now. Majority of our backlog is from direct customers, governments, agencies, thousands of customers who order as their procurement cycles permit them. And so we believe that to be a very strong signal for their demand. We also have a channels business where channel inventories are very low and our channel partners are placing orders on us to replenish that inventory. So our demand signal from our -- both our direct customers and our indirect customers is pretty clean. And as Jack mentioned it is growing in both sides of the business. Thanks, Meta. Let me just add to that [Multiple Speakers] we launched the M500 last year, it started shipping a few months ago, a little bit earlier this year. The M500 we consider to be a significant leap up from our prior generation [Ferrari] (ph). And it builds upon a lot of the goodness that the Ferrari had and Ferrari from the WatchGuard legacy really has evolved with a lot of customer feedback. Critically for the M500 we have added some significant new AI capabilities. This is a platform that's really meant to deliver AI capabilities. At launch we launched it with two capabilities effectively officer and passenger safety, but in addition ALPR as well. And the ALPR stream actually contributes to the other sets of ALPR cameras we have in our portfolio. These feed into one of the largest -- the industry's largest license plate databases that we have. Right now we're exceeding $50 billion of plate rates.  And to give you an idea of, like the rate at which it gets refreshed, in Q1 of this year we accounted for about $2.4 billion plate rate and to give you understanding of the frequency at which we are growing here compared to the previous year, we doubled the plate rate. So overall from a mobile video standpoint and in ALPR standpoint we're doing fantastic. Ben, I was just going to say the last part that you said. I think it is more PCR related. I think the way we do that is, I think Molloy and John Zidar during this time work really closely with the channel partners, particularly in North America on prioritization, on active conversations, on transparency, on what they really need versus what they may think they want, to try to eliminate any kind of artificial forecasting. So I think it's a reflection of the relationships we have with the channel partners. And I have to tip my hat to John Zidar who runs that organization under Molloy.  I think the way you sort through that is the efficacy and the authenticity of the conversations with the partners during these tough times. And I think Molloy and his team are doing that. Thanks, Ben. The only thing I'd add on the high tier and APX. APX NEXT is the complexity of those products and the joint engineering we do, and the supply lines we have for semiconductors are unique to those products and we're doing a good job in getting the security of that supply lines. So there are some commonalities, but also some uniqueness in our key suppliers and public safety LMR are doing a good job of getting us what we need. Thank you. Fahad. Louie, how you doing? Okay. Louie, I'll start and Mahesh may want to color in some lines. I think first of all, as it relates to fixed video, security and access control, we've taken a premise and a look at the market to say we want to make sure we meet our customers' for where they are. So it started with Avigilon, which is an on-prem end-to-end solution. We've invested in Avigilon cloud services, but they had a legacy Access Control business as well. Actually that business was actually the highest growth within the Avigilon portfolio one point in time, but we really saw a move to cloud and mobility, particularly as people want -- they want smartphones capability to access a building instead of an old keycard. And well, I would also tell you that Openpath is seen -- it's been -- it outkicked it business case due to the fact that there is a shortage on card readers right now, like a lot of things in the heart. So that's really accelerated the growth into the cloud for Openpath. So I think you will hear a lot of good things.  The other piece with Openpath as I said is its cloud. native, which is different to the most. So we think we've got a pretty good strategy as it relates to both in terms of a buyer wants to cloud solution or Openpath. I mean, now the cloud solution are an on-prem solution. Mahesh, anything you want to add to that. Thanks, Louis. In terms of state and local budget cycles. I'll remind everyone we have thousands of customers in North America. A common changeover in year is around July 1. So they will look at available funds and as well as stimulus and set their priorities. So we'll see what those budgets look like, but all indications are with the backstop of funding that will continue. Yeah. I just want to close -- Thank you for that opportunity. I want to close by thanking all of the Motorola Solutions people around the world for their commitment, perseverance in what was a strong Q1. Despite the fluid and dynamic environment demand, it just remains exceptionally strong. The customer funding environment remains robust. We continue to make investments in software and video. And as Jason and others outlined in this call, we continue to take action to offset higher costs.  I would just say this, macroeconomic turbulence and uncertainty presents opportunity and we will continue to deploy capital against the backdrop of those opportunities that present themselves. Thank you for joining us. We look forward to talking to you again in a few months. And again to all the Motorola people, thank you, thank you, thank you. Much appreciated."

            "content": "Yeah. I think the Openpath team launched a video intercom reader in Q1 as well and that's sort of is a signal in terms of the convergence between video and access control more broadly. If you look at the architecture of Openpath cloud native with endpoints on friend like readers, but also the ability to tackle existing leaders, support that migration from on-prem to cloud. Ava is a very similar model as well where it can be either entirely cloud native or support a mix in between as well. The combination of Ava and Openpath gives us the opportunity to convert many of the security and access control use cases and expand that ecosystem. So we see a strong solution there that's end to end for security needs."

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And with that, I will turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim. And good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. First, Q4 was exceptional quarter. We achieved record revenue in both segments in all three technologies, including double digit growth in Video Security and Command Center, highlighting the strength and robust demand for our safety and security solutions that help protect people, property and places. Additionally, we expanded operating margins for the sixth consecutive quarter, generated over $1.2 billion of operating cash and strengthened our video security portfolio with the recent acquisition of IPVideo, creator of the HALO Smart Sensor. Second, our full year results were outstanding. In our Products and SI segment, we grew revenue 9%, driven by strong growth in both LMR and Video Security and we ended the year with record product backlog. We also expanded operating margins in this segment by 380 basis points, driven in part by higher ASPs and lower product costs. In Software and Services, revenue was up 10%, inclusive of the Airwave revenue reduction, highlighted by strong growth in Video Security, Command Center and our Services business outside of the UK. And we also generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion, up 12% versus the prior year. And finally, as we enter 2024, our robust backlog position coupled with the continued strong demand for our safety and security solutions positions us well for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 5% and was above our guidance with growth in both segments, both regions and all three technologies. FX tailwinds during the quarter were $16 million, while acquisitions added $17 million. GAAP operating earnings were $738 million or 25.9% of sales, up from 25.6% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $870 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. And non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%, up 10 basis points. The increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales and lower direct material costs. GAAP earnings per share was $3.47, up from $3.43 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.90, up 8% from $3.60 last year. The growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and higher margins. OpEx in Q4 was $597 million, up $60 million versus last year, primarily due to higher incentives and acquisitions in the current quarter -- current year. For the full year 2023, revenue was $10 billion, up 10% with strong growth in both segments and across all three technologies. Revenue from acquisitions was $98 million and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency rates was $38 million. GAAP operating earnings were $2.3 billion or 23% of sales versus 18.2% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by lower direct material costs, higher sales, the $147 million ESN fixed asset impairment charge in the prior year and lower intangible amortization expense in the current year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.8 billion, up $416 million and non-GAAP operating margins were 27.9% of sales, up from 26% of sales in the prior year, driven by lower direct material costs, higher sales, inclusive of higher ASPs and improved operating leverage. GAAP earnings per share was $9.93, up 25% compared to $7.93 in the prior year, primarily driven by higher earnings and the asset impairment charge related to the exit of ESN in the prior year, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $11.95, up 15% from $10.36 in 2022. On higher earnings, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. For the full year OpEx was $2.2 billion, up $178 million versus 2022, primarily driven by higher employee incentives and higher expenses associated with investments in Video and Rave. And the effective tax rate for 2023 was 21.9% compared to 20.1% in the prior year due to lower benefits from employee stock-based compensation in the current year. Turning to our cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $1.2 billion, driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes. And for the full year, we generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion, and record free cash flow of $1.8 billion. The increase was driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for 2023 included $804 million in share repurchases, $589 million in cash dividends and $253 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program and an 11% increase in our dividend, which is the 13th consecutive year of double digit increases. Moving next to segment results. In the Products and SI segment, Q4 sales were up 4% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video. Operating earnings were $567 million or 30.0% of sales, up from 28.4% in the prior year, driven by higher sales and lower direct material costs. Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include a $90 million P25 system and device order from a US customer. A $67 million P25 device order for emergency services telecommunications authority in Australia. A $57 million P25 APX NEXT devices order for a US customer. A $38 million P25 system order for the State of Arizona Department of Public Safety. A $31 million TETRA system order for a European customer. And a $13 million fixed video order for an international customer. And for the full year, Products and SI revenue was $6.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by higher sales of LMR and Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $15 million and currency headwinds were $19 million. Full year operating earnings were $1.5 billion or 24.3% of sales, up from 20.5% in the prior year on higher sales, inclusive of higher ASPs and lower direct material costs. In Software and Services, Q4 revenue was up 7%, driven by growth in Video, Command Center and LMR. Revenue from acquisitions was $15 million in the quarter and FX tailwinds were $11 million. Q4 operating earnings in the segment were $303 million and operating margins were 31.6%, down from 34.4% last year, primarily driven by the Airwave revenue reduction related to the price control. Some notable Q4 highlights in the segment include a $330 million LMR managed services renewal through 2034 for Denmark's nationwide public safety communications network. A $48 million Command Center order for the city of Chicago's Office of Public Safety Administration. A $20 million LMR service agreement for Spokane Washington Regional Emergency Communications and a $19 million mobile video order from a US customer. And finally, a $10 million command center order for the city and County of San Francisco. For the full year, revenue was $3.7 billion, up 10% on growth in LMR services, Command Center and Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $83 million and currency headwinds were $19 million. For the full year, operating earnings were $1.3 billion or 33.9% of sales, down 140 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the Airwave revenue reduction and higher acquisition related expenses. Looking next at our regional results. North America revenue was $2 billion in Q4, up 6% and $6.9 billion for the full year, up 9%, driven by growth in both segments and across all three technologies. And in international, Q4 revenue was $832 million, up 3% versus last year, driven by growth in Video and LMR. And for the full year, international revenue was $3 billion, up 11% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog for Q4 was $14.3 billion, down $88 million versus last year, inclusive of approximately $1 billion of backlog reduction related to the Airwave price control and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Sequentially, backlog was down $15 million, inclusive of the Airwave and ESN reduction and $160 million of favorable FX. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $93 million or 2% driven primarily by strong demand in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $99 million, also driven by demand in North America. In Software and Services, backlog decreased $181 million from last year and $114 million sequentially. Excluding Airwave and ESN, Software and Services backlog was up almost $800 million versus last year, driven by strong multi-year agreements in both regions. Turning now to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up approximately 8%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.50 and $2.55 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. And for the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 6% and non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.62 and $12.72 per share. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. Additionally, we expect another strong year of operating cash flow with 2024 expectations of $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. And before I turn it back to Greg, I wanted to share some additional highlights. First, I want to give you some color on the technology growth expectations that are included in the sales guidance for the year. In Video Security and Access Control, we're planning for 10% growth, which is informed by the acceleration and strong adoption of our cloud offerings. For Command Center, we also expect 10% growth consistent with last year's organic growth rate. And in LMR, we expect to grow mid-single digits or high single digits when normalized for the impact of the UK Home Office. Second, I would like to share with you some exciting updates about our Video business, in light of two recent partnerships that support our growth expectations, one with Jabil and another with Google. With Jabil, we've entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement where Jabil will assume responsibility for our manufacturing operations at our sites in Canada and Texas. This agreement further optimizes our video supply chain, provides redundancy, future cost savings and scalability. Additionally, it allows us to focus on engineering, designing and bringing to market video solutions that serve our customers' security needs, while continuing to enable regulatory compliance with NDAA rules for the procurement of secure equipment. And with Google, yesterday, we announced a new strategic agreement with Google Cloud that harnesses the power of their latest cloud advancements to enable assistive intelligence, such as accurate and reliable video content, mapping and other AI capabilities. Google Cloud also enables Avigilon Alta, our fast growing cloud native fixed video and access control platform, which we introduced a little more than a year ago. Alta combines the power of our AI analytics with the ease and simplicity of a cloud delivered VMS that is increasingly preferred by some verticals like education. The rapid adoption in Alta contributed almost a quarter of our growth last year to total video and includes a higher subscription attachment compared to a traditional Avigilon Unity sale. And finally, we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, including $1.7 billion in cash, a fixed rate balance debt maturity profile and our net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 is our lowest since 2015, providing us with ample flexibility to continue to deploy capital and drive shareholder value. I'll now turn the call-back to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Jason. First, 2023 was a phenomenal year for the company. We achieved [Technical Difficulty] significantly expanded operating margins, grew earnings per share by 15% and generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion. We also returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we strengthened our Video Security portfolio with the recent acquisition of IPVideo. Second, this past November, we announced our new brand narrative, solving for safer. This reflects our purposeful transformation centered on public safety and enterprise security and our sharpened focus on solving for safer communities, safer schools and safer businesses. Our solutions across LMR, Video Security and Command Center that are powered by artificial intelligence enable collaboration between public safety agencies and enterprises, connecting those in need with those who can help. And while we recognize technology is not the only way to a safer future, it does play a vital role. And finally, as we enter 2024, the momentum of our business remains strong. Funding for public safety continues to be a priority. Investments we've made in the portfolio, including our APX NEXT device. And by the way, the software applications that run on this device are driving higher ASPs for our products and strong growth in Software and Services. We're also seeing a noticeable acceleration of cloud adoption in Video Security that is driving margin accretive revenues in Software and Services. And with our exceptionally strong balance sheet, we have the opportunity to continue to deploy capital to drive long-term shareholder value. I'm extremely pleased how we're positioned and I expect 2024 to be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth for our company. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim.\nTim Yocum: Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. I have a question on the margin expansion in the business. I guess I wanted to ask about what kind of headwind you guys still had running through the business in 2023, I'm thinking about things like expedite fees and even freight costs. I know that a lot of those fees didn't come out of the model until you guys had burned down some backlog. So I guess I'm wondering how much of the headwind was in the 2023 numbers and then I assume that'll be all out fully for the 2024 year. I'm just kind of wondering what kind of benefit you might get on margins there. And then just as a follow-up, second question was just on Silver Lake. I'm just curious about, is there any update there and what those guys might do? And how might you kind of fund the unwind of that position? Thanks a lot.\nGreg Brown: Yeah, George. So just to reconfirm, we do expect operating margin expansion for 2024, that's in part by informed continued improvement in PPV. And I have to complement Jason in the supply chain and Jack's ops team did a great job exceeding what we set out as targets last year. And to remind you, we are expecting another $60 million of PPV improvement in this year in '24. From a gross margin standpoint for the firm, we expect them to be comparable to slightly up. So I think we do a pretty good job on the operating leverage side of this business, both on gross margin and operating margin. By the way, the OpEx envelope year-over-year is probably going to be up about $80 million, '24 over '23, of which half is organic, $40 million, and $40 million is inorganic. As it relates to Silver Lake, really no update. They are in the final year of the second five year pipe. It expires in September. The diluted share count is already calculated into our EPS expectations. So really nothing to report at this point. The partnership remains good and we'll see how that plays forward for the balance of the year. By the way, we do expect -- on the expiration of the pipe, we do expect higher interest expense this year to be about $40 million, which includes the assumption of $1.3 billion of refinancing, of which $1 billion is the Silver Lake notes and $300 million is debt that expires in September this year.\nGeorge Notter: Great. That's helpful. Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTim Long: Thank you. Just wanted to get little bit on the top line. Maybe, Greg, for you. The Q1 guide looks -- it looks pretty strong. But the full year is a little bit lower on growth. So maybe can you talk about visibility or what you're kind of expecting in the back half of the year? Is it just compares conservatism or anything else we need to be aware of that little discrepancy in growth rates? And then, I did want to secondly, follow-up on the video, 10% growth. I mean, obviously the numbers are getting bigger here, but can you kind of put that in context of where you are with share gains and getting into -- deeper into the government verticals and getting some benefits this year from ARPA funding say on Safe Schools and other areas. If you can just put that into context with some of those drivers, that would be great. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: So let's take the full year first. I think it's important to say that I'm super proud of last year. But to your point, as we're sitting here in February, backlog is strong, but Tim, so is the pipeline. So we're in a good aged backlog position but the pipeline remains strong as well, which makes me feel good about where we sit here for the balance of the year. I'd also tell you that when we think about the full year guide, it's coming off of a Q4 that exceeded our guidance. It's coming off of a full year that exceeded our guidance. And if you anchor it to the color I gave last time at about $10.5 billion, it's about $75 million higher than that reference a quarter ago. Now having said all that, so we guide for full year 6%, I remind you that $200 million is a headwind related to the UK Home Office. So year-over-year, we expect Airwave revenue to be about $375 million. But if you take year-over-year, you add in the $200 million full year UK Home Office headwind that can normalize the year-over-year comparison. Additionally, one other thing worth mentioning is and Jack talked about this a quarter ago, we had exceptionally strong revenue contribution from Ukraine of $150 million last year. And based on what's expected to be shipped in backlog, we expect that to be $50 million. So you take the year-over-year 6%, you take $200 million detriment for UK Home Office headwind, you normalize for Ukraine and I think our growth is quite solid and a prudent guide at this point in time.\nJason Winkler: One other insight into the video growth of approximately 10% this year. Within that, we're really pleased with the cloud growth that we're seeing. Alta which we talked about on the call, the platform is, which is cloud native is growing exceptionally well. We've also made a decision to rationalize some of our on-prem VMS. And the combination of that growth rate in '24 and rationalizing the VMS is about $40 million of impact in 2024. So we're continuing to grow. And, Jack, do you want to talk about the market and how we're doing in Video?\nJack Molloy: Yeah. Tim, I'd also dimensionalize both -- Jason alluded to it, both in script and his comments, clouds growing, but we also -- our expectations are also that are on-prem but business is very healthy, continues to grow. As it relates to share, we believe, we\u2019re -- continue to take market share. You also asked the question, Tim, in government. Total government video sales that encompasses both mobile and fixed video are now at $500 million in 2023. And I would highlight our government video growth, it's growing faster than our overall total business. So I think -- I don't think it's being driven at all by our -- but I think it's being driven by prioritization and really building more and more efficiency and mobility within police forces as they have to contend with more and more crime.\nGreg Brown: Tim, one other thing, just because we're still to George's question weaning off PPV, and we'll have some commensurate benefits this year. If you take last year and this year, as we're working through the supply chain and elevated inventory and an improved freight in PPV, if you look at first half and second half, Tim, to your point about guide and linearity, it's very similar to last year. So I'm not concerned about anything as we sit here with our expectation for the full year performance.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you very much.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. One question, one follow-up. So just on the supply chain, I think this was alluded to a little bit, but just if you can give any more color on the latest you're seeing there and any noticeable impact from some of the disruption we've seen on the Red Sea front, if that's impacted you guys at all in terms of costs. And then secondarily, can you just talk a little bit more about the Jabil agreement, strategic rationale there and any cost implications we should keep in mind? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: I'll answer the second one first. The Jabil agreement is for them in 2024 to operate the two factories that will be transitioning to them. So not a significant change in cost profile in '24, but as we look to '25, with our growth expectations, there'll be opportunities for cost as well as an efficient way to scale the growth that we're expecting. So it was an agreement and us looking into the future and we're very pleased with it and providing us additional redundancy as well. It will help us scale, grow and also manage our cost envelope as we grow.\nMatthew Niknam: And the Red Sea?\nGreg Brown: The Red Sea, we remain primarily on air as our mode of transportation. And so as a result, not a lot on the ocean and the impact of higher container rates is negligible for us. So given the state of the supply chain, while it's improving, we found that air and air rates are a good investment to make. And make sure that we're getting everything we need when we need it. We've seen continued improvement from supply chain and our vendors, particularly in some semiconductors. And they have some improvements to make and we expect them to continue to improve on the deliveries of -- in particular, nanometer chips of 40 nanometers and above in some cases. So improving and working through it.\nJason Winkler: And as we worked through the year, it would be our expectation at the end of the year to have overall inventory reduced. Again, this year, as things normalize and improve.\nMatthew Niknam: That's relative to the $827 million you ended last year at?\nGreg Brown: That's right. The $827 million was down $200 million from its 12 month predecessor and we expect to drive $827 million down even further by year's end as we navigate an improving environment.\nMatthew Niknam: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nJason Winkler: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Jason, I just wanted to start on backlog trends for a clarification. I know reported backlog in total appears, the headline appears to be down, but I think there's a lot of impact from Airwave in that. Could you just give us a sense of what backlog looks like ex-Airwave. And then just as a follow-up on that topic, either Jack or Greg or if you want both weigh in, this is just a metric that I think investors are watching very closely because backlog builds and records have happened across tech hardware, whether it's Cisco in networking or [PCEs] (ph) before that and led to a sharper digestion period than initially anticipated once that backlog started softening. So wondering if you could maybe just double click on the current state of supply and demand and address how you think about the similarities or differences in what you're seeing in your business and the time and shape of normalization, if and when that does happen. Thank you.\nJason Winkler: Yeah, I would start out and tell you that this is one of the things I'm most proud of when I look at trend for the full year. Overall backlog of $14.3 billion, ending year from a year ago with absorbing just under $800 million decrement for the calculation of Airwave and the three year plus or three year backlog that that sits. So we'll be able to keep that at the same level or comparable levels with that reduction is pretty significant. The other thing that gives me optimism is the exceptionally strong product backlog that we exited Q4 and the age backlog that we sit in the position of as we enter, but I also remind you, so I love the backlog position, but I also love the pipeline and the ongoing demand and what I see in the funnel and when I look at Molloy and his team's conversion rates, I'm optimistic by what's in backlog, I'm also optimistic what's in pipeline.\nJack Molloy: Couple of attributes I think that are important to understanding our backlog. First, over 95% of our backlog comes to us from our government customers and our public safety customers. So, and the majority of that is a direct relationship and a contractual one between us and an end customer. That is very important. And secondly, as you think about our backlog, we entered the year much like last year in a position where about half of our revenues for the year, a little bit more than that will come to us from backlog. And with that strength combined with the pipeline strength, that's what informs our guide for our 6% growth.\nJason Winkler: Exactly.\nAdam Tindle: Very helpful. Just quickly, Jason, I'm sorry if I missed it, did you talk about free cash flow expectations in 2024 and any benefit from working capital with the Jabil agreement? I know sometimes that can have some transitional working capital that may be favorable. So free cash flow and the potential benefit.\nJason Winkler: Yeah, given that '24 is an [operate in place] (ph) kind of steady agreement, the working capital benefits are minimal in terms of that agreement. That said, we do expect working capital improvement. We talked about inventory. Our outlook for operating cash flow was $2.2 billion, that's up off of last year's record $2 billion. And within that operating cash flow, the contribution for our CapEx continues to be 15% or less. So we are expecting another strong year of cash flow.\nAdam Tindle: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Joseph Cardoso with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Cardoso: Hey. Thanks for the question, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on the last free cash flow question. I guess when I'm taking a look at it, it kind of implies that you're going to have a nice step-up in free cash flow generation, which in combination, exiting 2023 with I think, $1.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Looks like you'll have a fair bit of dry powder. Can you just help us think about the appetite in '24 to deploy cash, buybacks, M&A? Like should we be thinking about a more aggressive than typical nature? Any color would be appreciated. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Just in terms of capital allocation, we always think of it. And I love the fact that we have the balance sheet that we do. Jason, in his remarks talked about 1.4 net-debt to adjusted EBITDA. So I love the opportunity -- the flexibility that that gives us. I'm proud of the way we are good stewards of capital, both returning it to the shareholder and share repo and dividend, but being surgical and thoughtful to accretive acquisitions as well. So you think about this cash flow and I always think the wheel of 55-30-15. 55% of that cash flow is available for share repo or acquisition, fungible between the two, representative of the opportunities that come our way. 30% is dividend and 15% as Jason just referenced is CapEx. Even though we made only one acquisition at the end of the year in IP video, it certainly wasn't reflective of the engagements that we had. I think there's a lot of opportunity. I love the fact that we have the organic opportunity, whether it's device refresh, public safety prioritization, ARPA funding, enterprise opportunity, video and government, you know the opportunities that are in front of us organically, which are consequential. Equally, I'm excited about acquisition opportunities that can make our portfolio stronger, particularly around either video, software or services. So that's how we think about it.\nJason Winkler: The other thing that was noteworthy in '23 given the strength of our balance sheet is that we did earn an upgrade from Moody's to be Aa2. And as Greg mentioned, we will be in the debt markets this year refinancing $1.3 billion. And so, having taken note of that strength of the cash flow in '23 as well as our expectations in '24, that will help us as we refinance.\nJoseph Cardoso: Yeah. Guys, we appreciate the color there. And then just for my follow-up, can we just get an update on Airwave? I noticed in the press release, it sounded like you guys have the option to file an application with the UK Court of Appeal. Like are you guys actually taking that step? Can you provide any color around that? And then any color in terms of the next steps beyond the filing. And what other options you have at your disposal? Thanks for the question.\nGreg Brown: Yeah, we will pursue the next step, which is appealing to the UK Court of Appeals. We anticipate doing that next week. I've said all along and we remain pretty consistent that this whole thing has -- is beyond unique. We still believe it's unprecedented. We think it's legally flawed. But I'm not going to whine about it. I'm consistent in our description. We're going to pursue all the avenues available to us to defend our position. So to your point, that will be the filing of the appeal to the UK Court of Appeals next week. Unclear how long that will take. Probably, several months, but that remains to be seen. The only other thing I'd say is in public commentary that has been made with the CMA and other parliamentary hearings, it's pretty obvious that they believe that Airwave will be needed well beyond 2026. The references have been made by different parties to either meeting it through 2029 or 2030. So we will continue to move forward as best we can, engaging where we can, maintaining the investments that we need to make in this network and customer service levels as high as they've ever been.\nJason Winkler: And just as a reminder, our current backlog with the adjustment we mentioned in Q4 has our contract with the UK Home Office through 2026.\nGreg Brown: That\u2019s right.\nJason Winkler: There's opportunity for us to serve that account beyond that.\nJoseph Cardoso: I appreciate the color, guys. Thanks. Thanks for all the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tomer Zilberman with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nTomer Zilberman: Hey, guys. Thank you for the question. Just wanted to start off first with ARPA. I just wanted to get an update when it contributed to orders this year and your expectations going into next year. I know you previously noted, it was 5% contribution in '22 and I think you said in the first half of this year was also 5%.\nGreg Brown: Yeah, Tomer. That's consistent with what we've said before. I think that the key thing I would say as it relates to budgets right now is public safety number one, continues -- public safety spend continues to get prioritized. Number two, I've just scoured through the state and local budget drafts of 2025. By and large, the situation remains very solid. Even the states that have had an influx of immigrants have actually appropriated more dollars to public safety, which is interesting. But in generally speaking, when we look at it, the budget situations in state and local is very solid.\nTomer Zilberman: Got it. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. I know you touched on backlog already, but curious how the duration of the backlog has improved in the last three months and maybe the start of this year?\nJason Winkler: To begin this year, its duration has similar to slightly improved from the beginning of where we were entering last year. So the duration and the quality attributes of the backlog are as good or better than they were last year.\nTomer Zilberman: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Benjamin Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Bollin: Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking my question. Greg, bigger picture question. Going into an election year, curious how that has any impact if at all on how you guys thought about 2024 in your top line targets? And then a secondary question would be, could you share your thoughts around the typical refresh that you see in the fixed video deployment and how you think about replacement versus net new placements in the wild and how that kind of comes together in that 10% figure that you're talking about for video growth this year? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Yeah. Ben, in terms of the election year, it's interesting, we always talk about this too. If you kind of look back over the history of this business, we do pretty well, irrespective of the Republican or Democratic administration. So we've had great success in 2023, we expect to have another strong year this year. When there is a Presidential change, there is always some period of transition, they will typically operate under a continuing resolution. But in the main, generally speaking, we have a pretty solid foundational level of performance with kind of low beta risk, given the backlog and the continual high priority demand in public safety. On fixed video and we talked about Jason articulated, the 10% target for this year. Look, I actually like the fact that we have the width and breadth of the portfolio that we do. So we have the broadest portfolio in Video, fixed or mobile, prem or cloud, and we can meet the customer wherever they want to be met to buy. Most of our customers have both cloud and prem. If in fact that there is a notable acceleration of cloud adoption, which we've seen and we are seeing that moves more towards cloud, that's great. If that moderates the top line growth from 15% to 10%, that's okay too. Because [Technical Difficulty] revenue, the stickiness with the customer relationship and as Molloy said, he and we still believe we're taking share. So we feel good about the position. In terms of refresh on cameras, Jack, maybe you want to talk about that.\nJack Molloy: Yeah. Ben, it obviously varies if there city wide deployments, meaning outside cameras, you start to see a replacement cycle of anywhere kind of three to five years in the networks that we manage. Internally, those upgrades are more driven by the R&D investments that Mahesh and team have made around analytics. I would note one thing, the acquisition we made in telco, we're actually very pleased in 2023 with the growth that Telco had. But as we think about competitive VMSs that are out there, the work that we have ahead of us this year is to go and leverage our telco portfolio to drive -- to drive new opportunities in the camera replacement cycle.\nMahesh Saptharishi: Just one more thing to add to that is just to support our Alta growth with Video, one of our initial acquisition thesis was just the ability to expand the camera portfolio that Alta supports. And something that we did towards the end of last year was to expand the entire H6SL which is one of the more popular within the Avigilon camera family. Now that is entirely supported within Alta video. And I think that's also going to help with the refresh cycles and also help with some of the transition to cloud. Unity8, we introduced that last year. And Unity8, one of the special thing about it is, it's not just done on-prem solution, it's actually an on-prem solution that can bridge into the cloud side as well. So as we think about those transitions, the boundary between on-prem and cloud, it's a bit fuzzy and I think in a good way for us.\nBenjamin Bollin: Thanks, guys.\nGreg Brown: Thank you. Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.\nKeith Housum: Good afternoon guys. And great job on the quarter and for the year. Guys, question for you on the IPVideo acquisition. Perhaps just walk us through some rationale for that acquisition and perhaps where you see some cross-selling opportunities and growth opportunities going forward?\nJason Winkler: Sure. So the HALO Video sensor, our [health HALO] (ph) sensor is actually not a new thing for us. We have -- Avigilon had partnered with IPVideo for quite some years. We've actually been reselling the IPVideo solution. And the key reason there is that there are plenty of situations like in schools where video cannot be used in certain locations, but these sensors can. So think of it as the detection of smoking vape sensors, et cetera in bathrooms, in areas where we typically do not install cameras. But become quite important from a security and a safety standpoint. HALO is sort of the leading sensor when it comes to air quality, vape sensing, audio analytics including gunshot detection. And so as we think about really expanding our capability within education and beyond, this is just a natural fit for us to bring in and integrate more closely with our Unity and Alta platforms.\nGreg Brown: The only thing I\u2019d add on that, just in terms of cross sell would be that they've done very well in education, it's our role to get in and expand that business into healthcare, into workplaces, into transit areas where you have issues with people smoking and those kind of things as well. We think we've got the relationships to extend in those markets as well.\nKeith Housum: Okay. Makes sense. Helpful. I appreciate it. Small question, changing gears, slightly here. No conversation on PCR and I know there's been some moving pieces throughout the year in terms of getting out of some of the areas like Asia, but perhaps just give an update on where PCR stands and I know there was also some issues with supply chain earlier in the year. Any update would be helpful there. Thanks.\nGreg Brown: Yeah. PCR actually did great in '23, Keith. About a $1.1 billion of revenue last year. It was a record in full year '23. So the performance by that team was exceptional and I would expect PCR to be comparable levels this year. That's informed into the LMR mid single digit technology growth or actually high single digit when you normalize for Airwave. So PCR is quite resilient and doing well.\nKeith Housum: Great. Much appreciated. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: You bet.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nLouie DiPalma: Greg, Jason, Jack, Mahesh and Tim, good afternoon.\nGreg Brown: Louie, how you doing?\nLouie DiPalma: Doing great. I was wondering, does Google bring any special benefits for partnering with them for Alta versus the other major cloud providers? I know you have -- I think partnership with Azure for your Command Center business.\nJack Molloy: Yeah, Louie. So, to begin with, Avigilon Alta Video is already on Google Cloud today. And this is really a scale story and especially a scale around some key vectors, for example, AI. And so as we think about expanding Alta geographically. As we think about expanding Alta, and more broadly video across our capability set, AI was important, mapping capabilities was important, low latency data delivery, video delivery was important. And we thought that Google would be a good partner as we expand our installation, our capability of deploying within Google Cloud. In terms of sort of more a broader comment on this. Look, there's lots of stuff happening in the cloud world today, whether that's on the AI side, core cloud services, et cetera. And we want to be able to provide our customers with the best performance at the best price point. And so this Google partnership is really part of our multi-cloud strategy at the end of it all. So that's really what drove it.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And are the economics significantly different for Alta versus Unity? Are you actively pushing for one instead of the other?\nGreg Brown: We're positioned to offer our customers a choice. As Jack mentioned, we have growth expectations for both Unity, the on-prem as well as Alta, customers like those in education, we mentioned on the call are increasingly choosing Alta. The difference between the two is really how the VMS or software layers delivered. In the case of Alta, the VMS is delivered and deployed to the cloud under a term license. And in the case of Unity, it's an on-prem and more of a perpetual with a maintenance arrangement. So, those are the two models we have. Jack, customers are\u2026\nJack Molloy: Yeah. Two things there, Louie is the purchase decision remains very dynamic up until the last call it two to three weeks of a decision. But it's interesting as we look at win-loss data, one of the interesting things is that we've had our competitors who are more point solution providers who have been eliminated from decisions and we've had both Alta and Unity as finalist decisions. Which again, I think speaks to the breadth and the advantage that gives us in the marketplace.\nGreg Brown: And Louie, while the customer decides, it's not so much what we push, it's what they want. And as Jack said, many customers deploy -- they deploy both. Cloud fixed video is smaller from our overall revenue contribution than prem fixed video, but it's noteworthy to say that the growth of cloud fixed video is a strong multiple of the prem solution.\nLouie DiPalma: Yeah. Is there increasing momentum for Alta? I think you mentioned how 25% of the growth for 2023 with Video is from Alta, do you think that 25% is going to increase to 35% or something like that in 2024?\nGreg Brown: I don't know, it depends on what '24's growth composition ultimately ends up being. But what I will say is the cloud solution, in our case Alta is growing significantly faster than prem. So it's hard to predict the competition -- the composition at end of year '24 till we see how things settle.\nLouie DiPalma: That's all I have. Thanks, everyone.\nGreg Brown: Thank you, Louie.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, everyone. You've got [Jamie] (ph) on for Meta. I appreciate you taking the time. Similar to one of the earlier questions and understanding that you're still seeing strong growth and some impressive wins in the quarter, the Q4 growth and accompanying 2024 outlook in Command Center just looked a little bit lower than what we had been modeling. So, I guess is there any additional detail you can provide as to -- as to what you're seeing there and what's driving that outlook on '24? And then as a follow-up, how should we think about the contribution from pricing broadly in the growth outlook for '24?\nGreg Brown: And maybe we can tag team this. But Command Center, that's another one I was particularly proud of, because we grew 21% for the year. Now obviously Rave, what's the key driver in that and Rave has turned out to be a great acquisition for us, actually exceeding its business case. Can you take that out, Jamie, and you normalize for organic growth, the organic growth is another solid year of 10% growth. And by the way, that's inclusive of the growth of a $25 million headwind, that actually represents the transitioning out of ESN. So when you think about the overall 10% growth of Command Center, you do have to include the normalization of the exit of ESN that's worth $25 million but growth remains pretty strong in that segment as well.\nJason Winkler: And in terms of growth drivers for '24, we would expect growth from both volume and price Inclusive of ASPs continuing to grow as they did in '23 as our customers adopt more of the feature-rich part of the portfolio, including APX NEXT in other parts of the portfolio, we would expect that to continue and that's included in our growth expectations.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you so much for the time.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any additional comments or closing remarks.\nGreg Brown: Yeah, thanks. Listen, thank you for dialing-in and listening. I would just close by saying that, I think as we're entering 2024 or in it now in February, it's pretty clear that public safety and enterprise security have never been more important. I love the fact that we've got the broadest and most comprehensive product portfolio. I like the fact that as customers index to a more notable adoption on cloud acceleration, we're able to capitalize on that with our Alta solution. I love the fact that we have the APX NEXT refresh cycle in particular continue to march forward and that remains robust. And as was mentioned on the call, I am particularly excited about our partnership with Google. For all of the [Motorolas] (ph) listening-in on the call. I'm really proud of you. I'm proud of our team's execution in '23 and I'm anticipating another strong year in 2024 and I appreciate everything you're doing. I look-forward to catching-up and talking with you and debriefing in a quarter. Thanks again for all the great work.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 5% and was above our guidance with growth in both segments, both regions and all three technologies. FX tailwinds during the quarter were $16 million, while acquisitions added $17 million. GAAP operating earnings were $738 million or 25.9% of sales, up from 25.6% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $870 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. And non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%, up 10 basis points. The increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales and lower direct material costs. GAAP earnings per share was $3.47, up from $3.43 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.90, up 8% from $3.60 last year. The growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and higher margins. OpEx in Q4 was $597 million, up $60 million versus last year, primarily due to higher incentives and acquisitions in the current quarter -- current year. For the full year 2023, revenue was $10 billion, up 10% with strong growth in both segments and across all three technologies. Revenue from acquisitions was $98 million and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency rates was $38 million. GAAP operating earnings were $2.3 billion or 23% of sales versus 18.2% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by lower direct material costs, higher sales, the $147 million ESN fixed asset impairment charge in the prior year and lower intangible amortization expense in the current year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $2.8 billion, up $416 million and non-GAAP operating margins were 27.9% of sales, up from 26% of sales in the prior year, driven by lower direct material costs, higher sales, inclusive of higher ASPs and improved operating leverage. GAAP earnings per share was $9.93, up 25% compared to $7.93 in the prior year, primarily driven by higher earnings and the asset impairment charge related to the exit of ESN in the prior year, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $11.95, up 15% from $10.36 in 2022. On higher earnings, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. For the full year OpEx was $2.2 billion, up $178 million versus 2022, primarily driven by higher employee incentives and higher expenses associated with investments in Video and Rave. And the effective tax rate for 2023 was 21.9% compared to 20.1% in the prior year due to lower benefits from employee stock-based compensation in the current year. Turning to our cash flow. Q4 operating cash flow was $1.2 billion, driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes. And for the full year, we generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion, and record free cash flow of $1.8 billion. The increase was driven by higher earnings, partially offset by higher cash taxes. Capital allocation for 2023 included $804 million in share repurchases, $589 million in cash dividends and $253 million of CapEx. Additionally, during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a $2 billion increase to the share repurchase program and an 11% increase in our dividend, which is the 13th consecutive year of double digit increases. Moving next to segment results. In the Products and SI segment, Q4 sales were up 4% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video. Operating earnings were $567 million or 30.0% of sales, up from 28.4% in the prior year, driven by higher sales and lower direct material costs. Some notable Q4 wins and achievements in this segment include a $90 million P25 system and device order from a US customer. A $67 million P25 device order for emergency services telecommunications authority in Australia. A $57 million P25 APX NEXT devices order for a US customer. A $38 million P25 system order for the State of Arizona Department of Public Safety. A $31 million TETRA system order for a European customer. And a $13 million fixed video order for an international customer. And for the full year, Products and SI revenue was $6.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year, driven by higher sales of LMR and Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $15 million and currency headwinds were $19 million. Full year operating earnings were $1.5 billion or 24.3% of sales, up from 20.5% in the prior year on higher sales, inclusive of higher ASPs and lower direct material costs. In Software and Services, Q4 revenue was up 7%, driven by growth in Video, Command Center and LMR. Revenue from acquisitions was $15 million in the quarter and FX tailwinds were $11 million. Q4 operating earnings in the segment were $303 million and operating margins were 31.6%, down from 34.4% last year, primarily driven by the Airwave revenue reduction related to the price control. Some notable Q4 highlights in the segment include a $330 million LMR managed services renewal through 2034 for Denmark's nationwide public safety communications network. A $48 million Command Center order for the city of Chicago's Office of Public Safety Administration. A $20 million LMR service agreement for Spokane Washington Regional Emergency Communications and a $19 million mobile video order from a US customer. And finally, a $10 million command center order for the city and County of San Francisco. For the full year, revenue was $3.7 billion, up 10% on growth in LMR services, Command Center and Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $83 million and currency headwinds were $19 million. For the full year, operating earnings were $1.3 billion or 33.9% of sales, down 140 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the Airwave revenue reduction and higher acquisition related expenses. Looking next at our regional results. North America revenue was $2 billion in Q4, up 6% and $6.9 billion for the full year, up 9%, driven by growth in both segments and across all three technologies. And in international, Q4 revenue was $832 million, up 3% versus last year, driven by growth in Video and LMR. And for the full year, international revenue was $3 billion, up 11% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog for Q4 was $14.3 billion, down $88 million versus last year, inclusive of approximately $1 billion of backlog reduction related to the Airwave price control and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN. Sequentially, backlog was down $15 million, inclusive of the Airwave and ESN reduction and $160 million of favorable FX. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $93 million or 2% driven primarily by strong demand in North America. Sequentially, backlog was up $99 million, also driven by demand in North America. In Software and Services, backlog decreased $181 million from last year and $114 million sequentially. Excluding Airwave and ESN, Software and Services backlog was up almost $800 million versus last year, driven by strong multi-year agreements in both regions. Turning now to our outlook. We expect Q1 sales to be up approximately 8%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.50 and $2.55 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. And for the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 6% and non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.62 and $12.72 per share. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. Additionally, we expect another strong year of operating cash flow with 2024 expectations of $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. And before I turn it back to Greg, I wanted to share some additional highlights. First, I want to give you some color on the technology growth expectations that are included in the sales guidance for the year. In Video Security and Access Control, we're planning for 10% growth, which is informed by the acceleration and strong adoption of our cloud offerings. For Command Center, we also expect 10% growth consistent with last year's organic growth rate. And in LMR, we expect to grow mid-single digits or high single digits when normalized for the impact of the UK Home Office. Second, I would like to share with you some exciting updates about our Video business, in light of two recent partnerships that support our growth expectations, one with Jabil and another with Google. With Jabil, we've entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement where Jabil will assume responsibility for our manufacturing operations at our sites in Canada and Texas. This agreement further optimizes our video supply chain, provides redundancy, future cost savings and scalability. Additionally, it allows us to focus on engineering, designing and bringing to market video solutions that serve our customers' security needs, while continuing to enable regulatory compliance with NDAA rules for the procurement of secure equipment. And with Google, yesterday, we announced a new strategic agreement with Google Cloud that harnesses the power of their latest cloud advancements to enable assistive intelligence, such as accurate and reliable video content, mapping and other AI capabilities. Google Cloud also enables Avigilon Alta, our fast growing cloud native fixed video and access control platform, which we introduced a little more than a year ago. Alta combines the power of our AI analytics with the ease and simplicity of a cloud delivered VMS that is increasingly preferred by some verticals like education. The rapid adoption in Alta contributed almost a quarter of our growth last year to total video and includes a higher subscription attachment compared to a traditional Avigilon Unity sale. And finally, we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet, including $1.7 billion in cash, a fixed rate balance debt maturity profile and our net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 is our lowest since 2015, providing us with ample flexibility to continue to deploy capital and drive shareholder value. I'll now turn the call-back to Greg. One other insight into the video growth of approximately 10% this year. Within that, we're really pleased with the cloud growth that we're seeing. Alta which we talked about on the call, the platform is, which is cloud native is growing exceptionally well. We've also made a decision to rationalize some of our on-prem VMS. And the combination of that growth rate in '24 and rationalizing the VMS is about $40 million of impact in 2024. So we're continuing to grow. And, Jack, do you want to talk about the market and how we're doing in Video? And as we worked through the year, it would be our expectation at the end of the year to have overall inventory reduced. Again, this year, as things normalize and improve. Thank you. Yeah, I would start out and tell you that this is one of the things I'm most proud of when I look at trend for the full year. Overall backlog of $14.3 billion, ending year from a year ago with absorbing just under $800 million decrement for the calculation of Airwave and the three year plus or three year backlog that that sits. So we'll be able to keep that at the same level or comparable levels with that reduction is pretty significant. The other thing that gives me optimism is the exceptionally strong product backlog that we exited Q4 and the age backlog that we sit in the position of as we enter, but I also remind you, so I love the backlog position, but I also love the pipeline and the ongoing demand and what I see in the funnel and when I look at Molloy and his team's conversion rates, I'm optimistic by what's in backlog, I'm also optimistic what's in pipeline. Exactly. Yeah, given that '24 is an [operate in place] (ph) kind of steady agreement, the working capital benefits are minimal in terms of that agreement. That said, we do expect working capital improvement. We talked about inventory. Our outlook for operating cash flow was $2.2 billion, that's up off of last year's record $2 billion. And within that operating cash flow, the contribution for our CapEx continues to be 15% or less. So we are expecting another strong year of cash flow. The other thing that was noteworthy in '23 given the strength of our balance sheet is that we did earn an upgrade from Moody's to be Aa2. And as Greg mentioned, we will be in the debt markets this year refinancing $1.3 billion. And so, having taken note of that strength of the cash flow in '23 as well as our expectations in '24, that will help us as we refinance. And just as a reminder, our current backlog with the adjustment we mentioned in Q4 has our contract with the UK Home Office through 2026. There's opportunity for us to serve that account beyond that. To begin this year, its duration has similar to slightly improved from the beginning of where we were entering last year. So the duration and the quality attributes of the backlog are as good or better than they were last year. Sure. So the HALO Video sensor, our [health HALO] (ph) sensor is actually not a new thing for us. We have -- Avigilon had partnered with IPVideo for quite some years. We've actually been reselling the IPVideo solution. And the key reason there is that there are plenty of situations like in schools where video cannot be used in certain locations, but these sensors can. So think of it as the detection of smoking vape sensors, et cetera in bathrooms, in areas where we typically do not install cameras. But become quite important from a security and a safety standpoint. HALO is sort of the leading sensor when it comes to air quality, vape sensing, audio analytics including gunshot detection. And so as we think about really expanding our capability within education and beyond, this is just a natural fit for us to bring in and integrate more closely with our Unity and Alta platforms. And in terms of growth drivers for '24, we would expect growth from both volume and price Inclusive of ASPs continuing to grow as they did in '23 as our customers adopt more of the feature-rich part of the portfolio, including APX NEXT in other parts of the portfolio, we would expect that to continue and that's included in our growth expectations."

            "content": "Thanks, Tim. And good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. First, Q4 was exceptional quarter. We achieved record revenue in both segments in all three technologies, including double digit growth in Video Security and Command Center, highlighting the strength and robust demand for our safety and security solutions that help protect people, property and places. Additionally, we expanded operating margins for the sixth consecutive quarter, generated over $1.2 billion of operating cash and strengthened our video security portfolio with the recent acquisition of IPVideo, creator of the HALO Smart Sensor. Second, our full year results were outstanding. In our Products and SI segment, we grew revenue 9%, driven by strong growth in both LMR and Video Security and we ended the year with record product backlog. We also expanded operating margins in this segment by 380 basis points, driven in part by higher ASPs and lower product costs. In Software and Services, revenue was up 10%, inclusive of the Airwave revenue reduction, highlighted by strong growth in Video Security, Command Center and our Services business outside of the UK. And we also generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion, up 12% versus the prior year. And finally, as we enter 2024, our robust backlog position coupled with the continued strong demand for our safety and security solutions positions us well for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jason. Thanks, Jason. First, 2023 was a phenomenal year for the company. We achieved [Technical Difficulty] significantly expanded operating margins, grew earnings per share by 15% and generated record operating cash flow of $2 billion. We also returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we strengthened our Video Security portfolio with the recent acquisition of IPVideo. Second, this past November, we announced our new brand narrative, solving for safer. This reflects our purposeful transformation centered on public safety and enterprise security and our sharpened focus on solving for safer communities, safer schools and safer businesses. Our solutions across LMR, Video Security and Command Center that are powered by artificial intelligence enable collaboration between public safety agencies and enterprises, connecting those in need with those who can help. And while we recognize technology is not the only way to a safer future, it does play a vital role. And finally, as we enter 2024, the momentum of our business remains strong. Funding for public safety continues to be a priority. Investments we've made in the portfolio, including our APX NEXT device. And by the way, the software applications that run on this device are driving higher ASPs for our products and strong growth in Software and Services. We're also seeing a noticeable acceleration of cloud adoption in Video Security that is driving margin accretive revenues in Software and Services. And with our exceptionally strong balance sheet, we have the opportunity to continue to deploy capital to drive long-term shareholder value. I'm extremely pleased how we're positioned and I expect 2024 to be another year of strong revenue and earnings growth for our company. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Yeah, George. So just to reconfirm, we do expect operating margin expansion for 2024, that's in part by informed continued improvement in PPV. And I have to complement Jason in the supply chain and Jack's ops team did a great job exceeding what we set out as targets last year. And to remind you, we are expecting another $60 million of PPV improvement in this year in '24. From a gross margin standpoint for the firm, we expect them to be comparable to slightly up. So I think we do a pretty good job on the operating leverage side of this business, both on gross margin and operating margin. By the way, the OpEx envelope year-over-year is probably going to be up about $80 million, '24 over '23, of which half is organic, $40 million, and $40 million is inorganic. As it relates to Silver Lake, really no update. They are in the final year of the second five year pipe. It expires in September. The diluted share count is already calculated into our EPS expectations. So really nothing to report at this point. The partnership remains good and we'll see how that plays forward for the balance of the year. By the way, we do expect -- on the expiration of the pipe, we do expect higher interest expense this year to be about $40 million, which includes the assumption of $1.3 billion of refinancing, of which $1 billion is the Silver Lake notes and $300 million is debt that expires in September this year. So let's take the full year first. I think it's important to say that I'm super proud of last year. But to your point, as we're sitting here in February, backlog is strong, but Tim, so is the pipeline. So we're in a good aged backlog position but the pipeline remains strong as well, which makes me feel good about where we sit here for the balance of the year. I'd also tell you that when we think about the full year guide, it's coming off of a Q4 that exceeded our guidance. It's coming off of a full year that exceeded our guidance. And if you anchor it to the color I gave last time at about $10.5 billion, it's about $75 million higher than that reference a quarter ago. Now having said all that, so we guide for full year 6%, I remind you that $200 million is a headwind related to the UK Home Office. So year-over-year, we expect Airwave revenue to be about $375 million. But if you take year-over-year, you add in the $200 million full year UK Home Office headwind that can normalize the year-over-year comparison. Additionally, one other thing worth mentioning is and Jack talked about this a quarter ago, we had exceptionally strong revenue contribution from Ukraine of $150 million last year. And based on what's expected to be shipped in backlog, we expect that to be $50 million. So you take the year-over-year 6%, you take $200 million detriment for UK Home Office headwind, you normalize for Ukraine and I think our growth is quite solid and a prudent guide at this point in time. Tim, one other thing, just because we're still to George's question weaning off PPV, and we'll have some commensurate benefits this year. If you take last year and this year, as we're working through the supply chain and elevated inventory and an improved freight in PPV, if you look at first half and second half, Tim, to your point about guide and linearity, it's very similar to last year. So I'm not concerned about anything as we sit here with our expectation for the full year performance. Thanks, Tim. I'll answer the second one first. The Jabil agreement is for them in 2024 to operate the two factories that will be transitioning to them. So not a significant change in cost profile in '24, but as we look to '25, with our growth expectations, there'll be opportunities for cost as well as an efficient way to scale the growth that we're expecting. So it was an agreement and us looking into the future and we're very pleased with it and providing us additional redundancy as well. It will help us scale, grow and also manage our cost envelope as we grow. The Red Sea, we remain primarily on air as our mode of transportation. And so as a result, not a lot on the ocean and the impact of higher container rates is negligible for us. So given the state of the supply chain, while it's improving, we found that air and air rates are a good investment to make. And make sure that we're getting everything we need when we need it. We've seen continued improvement from supply chain and our vendors, particularly in some semiconductors. And they have some improvements to make and we expect them to continue to improve on the deliveries of -- in particular, nanometer chips of 40 nanometers and above in some cases. So improving and working through it. That's right. The $827 million was down $200 million from its 12 month predecessor and we expect to drive $827 million down even further by year's end as we navigate an improving environment. Just in terms of capital allocation, we always think of it. And I love the fact that we have the balance sheet that we do. Jason, in his remarks talked about 1.4 net-debt to adjusted EBITDA. So I love the opportunity -- the flexibility that that gives us. I'm proud of the way we are good stewards of capital, both returning it to the shareholder and share repo and dividend, but being surgical and thoughtful to accretive acquisitions as well. So you think about this cash flow and I always think the wheel of 55-30-15. 55% of that cash flow is available for share repo or acquisition, fungible between the two, representative of the opportunities that come our way. 30% is dividend and 15% as Jason just referenced is CapEx. Even though we made only one acquisition at the end of the year in IP video, it certainly wasn't reflective of the engagements that we had. I think there's a lot of opportunity. I love the fact that we have the organic opportunity, whether it's device refresh, public safety prioritization, ARPA funding, enterprise opportunity, video and government, you know the opportunities that are in front of us organically, which are consequential. Equally, I'm excited about acquisition opportunities that can make our portfolio stronger, particularly around either video, software or services. So that's how we think about it. Yeah, we will pursue the next step, which is appealing to the UK Court of Appeals. We anticipate doing that next week. I've said all along and we remain pretty consistent that this whole thing has -- is beyond unique. We still believe it's unprecedented. We think it's legally flawed. But I'm not going to whine about it. I'm consistent in our description. We're going to pursue all the avenues available to us to defend our position. So to your point, that will be the filing of the appeal to the UK Court of Appeals next week. Unclear how long that will take. Probably, several months, but that remains to be seen. The only other thing I'd say is in public commentary that has been made with the CMA and other parliamentary hearings, it's pretty obvious that they believe that Airwave will be needed well beyond 2026. The references have been made by different parties to either meeting it through 2029 or 2030. So we will continue to move forward as best we can, engaging where we can, maintaining the investments that we need to make in this network and customer service levels as high as they've ever been. That's right. Yeah, Tomer. That's consistent with what we've said before. I think that the key thing I would say as it relates to budgets right now is public safety number one, continues -- public safety spend continues to get prioritized. Number two, I've just scoured through the state and local budget drafts of 2025. By and large, the situation remains very solid. Even the states that have had an influx of immigrants have actually appropriated more dollars to public safety, which is interesting. But in generally speaking, when we look at it, the budget situations in state and local is very solid. Yeah. Ben, in terms of the election year, it's interesting, we always talk about this too. If you kind of look back over the history of this business, we do pretty well, irrespective of the Republican or Democratic administration. So we've had great success in 2023, we expect to have another strong year this year. When there is a Presidential change, there is always some period of transition, they will typically operate under a continuing resolution. But in the main, generally speaking, we have a pretty solid foundational level of performance with kind of low beta risk, given the backlog and the continual high priority demand in public safety. On fixed video and we talked about Jason articulated, the 10% target for this year. Look, I actually like the fact that we have the width and breadth of the portfolio that we do. So we have the broadest portfolio in Video, fixed or mobile, prem or cloud, and we can meet the customer wherever they want to be met to buy. Most of our customers have both cloud and prem. If in fact that there is a notable acceleration of cloud adoption, which we've seen and we are seeing that moves more towards cloud, that's great. If that moderates the top line growth from 15% to 10%, that's okay too. Because [Technical Difficulty] revenue, the stickiness with the customer relationship and as Molloy said, he and we still believe we're taking share. So we feel good about the position. In terms of refresh on cameras, Jack, maybe you want to talk about that. Thank you. Thanks, Ben. The only thing I'd add on that, just in terms of cross sell would be that they've done very well in education, it's our role to get in and expand that business into healthcare, into workplaces, into transit areas where you have issues with people smoking and those kind of things as well. We think we've got the relationships to extend in those markets as well. Yeah. PCR actually did great in '23, Keith. About a $1.1 billion of revenue last year. It was a record in full year '23. So the performance by that team was exceptional and I would expect PCR to be comparable levels this year. That's informed into the LMR mid single digit technology growth or actually high single digit when you normalize for Airwave. So PCR is quite resilient and doing well. You bet. Louie, how you doing? We're positioned to offer our customers a choice. As Jack mentioned, we have growth expectations for both Unity, the on-prem as well as Alta, customers like those in education, we mentioned on the call are increasingly choosing Alta. The difference between the two is really how the VMS or software layers delivered. In the case of Alta, the VMS is delivered and deployed to the cloud under a term license. And in the case of Unity, it's an on-prem and more of a perpetual with a maintenance arrangement. So, those are the two models we have. Jack, customers are... And Louie, while the customer decides, it's not so much what we push, it's what they want. And as Jack said, many customers deploy -- they deploy both. Cloud fixed video is smaller from our overall revenue contribution than prem fixed video, but it's noteworthy to say that the growth of cloud fixed video is a strong multiple of the prem solution. I don't know, it depends on what '24's growth composition ultimately ends up being. But what I will say is the cloud solution, in our case Alta is growing significantly faster than prem. So it's hard to predict the competition -- the composition at end of year '24 till we see how things settle. Thank you, Louie. And maybe we can tag team this. But Command Center, that's another one I was particularly proud of, because we grew 21% for the year. Now obviously Rave, what's the key driver in that and Rave has turned out to be a great acquisition for us, actually exceeding its business case. Can you take that out, Jamie, and you normalize for organic growth, the organic growth is another solid year of 10% growth. And by the way, that's inclusive of the growth of a $25 million headwind, that actually represents the transitioning out of ESN. So when you think about the overall 10% growth of Command Center, you do have to include the normalization of the exit of ESN that's worth $25 million but growth remains pretty strong in that segment as well. Thanks, Jamie. Yeah, thanks. Listen, thank you for dialing-in and listening. I would just close by saying that, I think as we're entering 2024 or in it now in February, it's pretty clear that public safety and enterprise security have never been more important. I love the fact that we've got the broadest and most comprehensive product portfolio. I like the fact that as customers index to a more notable adoption on cloud acceleration, we're able to capitalize on that with our Alta solution. I love the fact that we have the APX NEXT refresh cycle in particular continue to march forward and that remains robust. And as was mentioned on the call, I am particularly excited about our partnership with Google. For all of the [Motorolas] (ph) listening-in on the call. I'm really proud of you. I'm proud of our team's execution in '23 and I'm anticipating another strong year in 2024 and I appreciate everything you're doing. I look-forward to catching-up and talking with you and debriefing in a quarter. Thanks again for all the great work."

            "name": "Jack Molloy",
            "content": "Yeah. Tim, I'd also dimensionalize both -- Jason alluded to it, both in script and his comments, clouds growing, but we also -- our expectations are also that are on-prem but business is very healthy, continues to grow. As it relates to share, we believe, we're -- continue to take market share. You also asked the question, Tim, in government. Total government video sales that encompasses both mobile and fixed video are now at $500 million in 2023. And I would highlight our government video growth, it's growing faster than our overall total business. So I think -- I don't think it's being driven at all by our -- but I think it's being driven by prioritization and really building more and more efficiency and mobility within police forces as they have to contend with more and more crime. Couple of attributes I think that are important to understanding our backlog. First, over 95% of our backlog comes to us from our government customers and our public safety customers. So, and the majority of that is a direct relationship and a contractual one between us and an end customer. That is very important. And secondly, as you think about our backlog, we entered the year much like last year in a position where about half of our revenues for the year, a little bit more than that will come to us from backlog. And with that strength combined with the pipeline strength, that's what informs our guide for our 6% growth. Yeah. Ben, it obviously varies if there city wide deployments, meaning outside cameras, you start to see a replacement cycle of anywhere kind of three to five years in the networks that we manage. Internally, those upgrades are more driven by the R&D investments that Mahesh and team have made around analytics. I would note one thing, the acquisition we made in telco, we're actually very pleased in 2023 with the growth that Telco had. But as we think about competitive VMSs that are out there, the work that we have ahead of us this year is to go and leverage our telco portfolio to drive -- to drive new opportunities in the camera replacement cycle. Yeah, Louie. So, to begin with, Avigilon Alta Video is already on Google Cloud today. And this is really a scale story and especially a scale around some key vectors, for example, AI. And so as we think about expanding Alta geographically. As we think about expanding Alta, and more broadly video across our capability set, AI was important, mapping capabilities was important, low latency data delivery, video delivery was important. And we thought that Google would be a good partner as we expand our installation, our capability of deploying within Google Cloud. In terms of sort of more a broader comment on this. Look, there's lots of stuff happening in the cloud world today, whether that's on the AI side, core cloud services, et cetera. And we want to be able to provide our customers with the best performance at the best price point. And so this Google partnership is really part of our multi-cloud strategy at the end of it all. So that's really what drove it. Yeah. Two things there, Louie is the purchase decision remains very dynamic up until the last call it two to three weeks of a decision. But it's interesting as we look at win-loss data, one of the interesting things is that we've had our competitors who are more point solution providers who have been eliminated from decisions and we've had both Alta and Unity as finalist decisions. Which again, I think speaks to the breadth and the advantage that gives us in the marketplace."

[Operator Instructions] The presentation materials and additional financial tables are posted on the Motorola Solutions' Investor Relations website. In addition, a webcast replay of the call will be available on our website within three hours after the conclusion of this call. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor.  All participants have been placed in a listen only mode. You'll have an opportunity to ask questions after today's presentation. [Operator Instructions] I now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference.\nTim Yocum: Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2023 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Malloy, Executive Vice President and COO and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary and Jack and Mahesh will join for a Q&A.  We posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call we referenced non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted.  A number of forward-looking statement will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about the factors that can cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call in the risk factor section of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K or any quarter The report on form 10-Q, and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown : Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks everybody for joining us today. First, Q3 was another strong quarter with revenue and earnings per share exceeding our guidance driven by continued strong demand, and an improving supply chain environment. Revenue was up 8% in the quarter highlighted by 12% growth in software and services, and 5% growth in products and systems integration.  We also expanded operating margins for the fifth consecutive quarter, which resulted in record Q3 operating earnings in both segments and over $700 million of operating cash flow.  Second, investments in safety and security continue to be a priority for our customers. And we had another record orders quarter in Q3. Year-to-date orders are up 11% driven by strong software and services, record U.S. Federal demand and continued adoption of our APX NEXT device by U.S. state and local customers. Additionally, we ended Q3 with record backlog of $14.3 billion, up 6% versus the prior year. And finally, based on our Q3 results and continued momentum in the business, we are again raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS for the third time this year.  I'll now turn the call over to Jason. \nJason Winkler : Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 8% and was above our guidance with growth in both segments both regions and all three technologies. FX tailwinds during the quarter were $13 million while acquisitions added $19 million. GAAP operating earnings were $639 million or 25% of sales up from 15.7% in the year ago quarter, which had the impact of the $147 million fixed asset impairment charge related to our exit from the ESN contract in the UK.  Non-GAAP operating earnings were $741 million, up 10% From the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 29%, up 50 basis points driven by higher sales, lower material costs and improved operating leverage partially offset by a higher mix of international product shipments and the revenue deferral related to Airwave.  GAAP earnings per share was $2.70, up from $1.63 in the year ago quarter, which has the impact of the ESN asset impairment. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.19 up 6% from $3 per share last year. The growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins, partially offset by the Airwave deferral and a higher effective tax rate in the current year. OpEx in Q3 was $551 million, up $29 million versus last year primarily due to acquisitions and higher employee incentives in the current year.  Turning to cash flow, Q3 operating cash flow was $714 million up $326 million versus last year and free cash flow was $649 million of $331 million. The increase in year-over-year cash flow was primarily driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. And with our Q3 year-to-date operating cash flow of $799 million, up significantly from last year, we are solidly on track to deliver on our $1.9 billion of operating cash flow outlook for this year.  Capital allocation for Q3 included $147 million in cash dividends $322 million in share repurchases and $65 million of CapEx.  Moving to segments. In the Products and SI segment, sales were up 5% versus last year driven by growth in both LMR and video. Currency tailwinds were $4 million, and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $1 million. Operating earnings for the segment were $420 million or 26.1% of sales, up from 24.5% in the prior year driven by higher sales, lower direct material costs and improved operating leverage, partially offset by mix.  Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in the Product segment include a $75 million P25 device order for a U.S. federal customer, a $55 million P25 System order for a Southeast Asia customer, a $42 million P25 device order for the Texas Department of Public Safety, a $30 million P25 device order for a U.S. federal customer, a $20 million P25 device order for Indiana State Police and a $3 million fixed video expansion order for a U.S. federal customer.  In software and services, revenue was up 12% inclusive of the Airwave deferral with 31% growth in Command Center and 15% growth in Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $18 million in the quarter, and FX tailwinds were $9 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $321 million, up 7% versus last year and operating margins were 34%, down from 35.7% last year. Excluding the Airwave deferral, operating margins for the segment were up, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage.  Some notable Q3 highlights in this segment include a $23 million LMR service agreement for a large European customer, a $23 million service agreement for East Bay regional communication systems in California, a $20 million LMR service agreement for the Los Angeles Police Department, a $12 million command center order for Tarrant County 911 District in Texas and an $8 million body-worn camera order for the Metro Nashville Police. Looking at our regional results. North America Q3 revenue was $1.8 billion, up 6% on growth in all three technologies. International Q3 revenue was $773 million, up 13% versus last year driven by growth in LMR and Video. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q3 record of $14.3 billion, up 6% or $764 million versus last year, inclusive of $321 million of favorable currency rates driven by strong demand in North America. Sequentially, backlog was down $4 million, inclusive of $125 million of unfavorable FX, driven by the revenue recognition of Airwave, partially offset by strong demand in North America. In Products and SI, ending backlog was up $62 million or 1% versus last year, driven primarily by strong demand in North America. And sequentially, backlog was up $80 million, also driven by strong demand in North America. In Software and Services, backlog increased $702 million compared to last year, inclusive of $294 million of favorable FX driven by strong demand for multiyear software and services contracts in North America, partially offset by the revenue recognition for Airwave. Sequentially, backlog was down $84 million, driven by unfavorable FX of $96 million, partially offset by growth in multiyear Software and Services contracts in North America. Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales growth of approximately 4%, with non-GAAP EPS between $3.60 and $3.65 per share. This assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%.  For the full year, we are again increasing both our revenue and earnings guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $9.93 billion to $9.945 billion, up from our prior range of $9.875 billion to $9.9 billion, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.65 and $11.70, up from our prior guide of $11.40 to $11.48 per share. The full year outlook assumes $40 million of FX headwinds, up $25 million from our prior guidance. A weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. Before I turn the call back to Greg, I'd like to highlight two points. In addition to the strength of our LMR and Video business, our Command Center portfolio performed well during the quarter. In Q3, we achieved strong growth, complemented by a robust contribution from Rave, an acquisition, which continues to exceed our expectations.  Secondly, our supply chain execution navigating extended lead times for some semiconductors and reducing broker purchases continues to drive year-over-year cost savings. We now expect the impact of lower broker purchases to be a $70 million tailwind for this year, up from our prior estimate of $60 million. As a result, we now expect full year operating margin expansion of approximately 200 basis points, up from our prior guidance of 175 basis points.  I'll now turn the call back to Greg.\nGreg Brown : Thanks, Jason. First, I'm really pleased with our Q3 results, which highlight the durability and criticality of our business and the strength of our portfolio. Revenue was up 8%, and that's inclusive of the revenue deferral related to Airwave that we've talked to you about already. We also achieved record operating earnings in both segments, record Q3 operating cash flow of over $700 million and a Q3 record backlog that is 6% higher than last year, which positions us well as we head into next year.  Second, the resilient nature of our business and strong cash flow allows us to continue to be flexible as we deploy capital to drive shareholder value. The strength of our cash flow comes from strong demand from product refresh, consistent margin expansion and improving cash conversion. Through October, we've repurchased just under $800 million of stock, highlighting our conviction in the long-term value of MSI.  We also ended the quarter with net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.7, which provides us with a healthy balance sheet and additional firepower to continue to invest both organically and consider inorganic investments as well. And finally, as we look to close out another record year, I think we're exceptionally well positioned for continued growth. Demand for our solutions remains robust. We're continuing to add value to our customers. Our end markets remain resilient, and our teams continue to execute at a high level.  I'll now turn the call over to Tim and welcome your questions accordingly.\nTim Yocum : Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to 1 question and 1 follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question? \nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is now open. \nTim Long : Yeah, the two, if I could. First, maybe on the Command Center and Software side, pretty strong, obviously, with Rave, a part of that. Could you maybe Greg talk a little bit about what's driving that addition of Rave seems to be positive. Is it adding to ability to cross-sell some of the different platforms or -- just a little bit more color on what's driving that and how Rave ties into that? And then the second one, on the backlog still being record, it's pretty impressive. Most companies are seeing backlog coming down. So a little color there and maybe how that makes you feel about next year as far as growth? Do you think you can kind of sustain the type of growth rates you're seeing this year? Thank you.\nGreg Brown : Just on Rave and then maybe Mahesh can jump in. I would tell you, Tim, I love the acquisition. I think it was well done by the internal team here that founded, did the diligence both technical strategic as well as financial. I love Todd Pyott and his entire team that's come over to the organization.  And the performance of Rave since joining Motorola has exceeded the business case and exceeded our expectations.\nMahesh Saptharishi : Full year, I would say that we still expect our growth to be 20%. Look, our core platforms, that's NG-911, CAD, Records Aware, are all doing well as well. As Jason read out in the script, St. Charles, Missouri, just refreshed their call handling solution and adopted our [indiscernible] routing. And you see us solution, Western Australia Police refreshed their CAD. There's also an ecosystem story here. Rave is certainly performing well above our expectations. Arizona is now the 15th state to sign on to Rave Alert. It's a statewide mass notification system. And as we're doing that, we're also refreshing all the call handling instances across the PSAPs in Arizona. And our call handling system integrated with Rave as appropriate here as well.  When you think about a city like Glendale, Glendale now brings in radio, brings in CAD 911, Rave, et cetera, now into a state-of-the-art real-time crime center, all integrated with Aware. And now you can think about orchestration when major incidents happened on the heels of things like active shooter incidents, et cetera, that benefit from the fact that the ecosystem allows you to now respond much faster.\nJason Winkler : Tim, on backlog, we remain in a strong backlog position with an 8% revenue print in Q3 and backlog of $14 billion or more being up 6%. Our backlog is very strong. And I'd also point out that our backlog comes over 95% of it from government customers, who buy what they need, when they need it and count on us to deliver it. So we remain -- and Q3 orders inbound in Q3, inbound orders were also strong. So our backlog position is one of strength and Greg, I'll turn it to you for further comments.\nGreg Brown : Yeah. And Tim, as it relates to 2024, obviously, we'll wait until February to give specifics on any kind of detailed guidance. I would tell you, as we sit here today from a high level, we would estimate revenue, again, kind of back of the cocktail napkin to be about $10.5 billion at this point as we sit here today. By the way, that's inclusive of $250 million of incremental revenue headwinds, about $200 million of that out of the UK home office. We've talked to you about that before. The deferral of Airwave representing a little bit over $100 million, the balance of that being the formal exit of ESN for a total of $200 million related to the UK Home Office and anticipated FX headwinds of about $50 million.  So high level, as I sit here today and take a look -- that's kind of how I would dimensionalize next year and filling in more detail when we get together in February.\nTim Long : Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. \nGreg Brown : Thank you, Tim. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is now open. \nGeorge Notter : Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Greg, you mentioned the UK I guess I was wondering what the latest and greatest is out of the UK. I know you guys were going through the CAD tribunal process. I think the release today references that you still haven't heard back. I think you had expected to hear back after a number of weeks. And so wondering what's going on there. I'm wondering if the delay in being back with you is potentially good news. But what do you think is going to happen there? And what does it look like in terms of the appeal processes if that CAD tribunal process did not work out? \nGreg Brown : Yeah. On the UK, there's really no news to report, George. We had the hearing on August 2 and 3. I think we reiterated the strong case, we feel with a high level of conviction. And you've heard me use adjectives before. I'm very specific with how I would describe the situation. I think it's unprecedented. I think it's overreaching. It's entirely disproportionate, but we made the case.  And as a result, we're waiting on that CAD, that competition appeals tribunal, you referenced that ruling. It's a fairly opaque regulatory process. So I couldn't speculate 1 way or the other on how to interpret that. We'll wait to get it. I would anticipate getting it certainly between now and the end of the year. And as I've already said as well, if it, in turn, does not go our way, we will continue to exhaust all legal options to defend the position we have, provisioning and delivering outstanding and very reliable emergency communication services throughout the UK.\nGeorge Notter : Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. I assume the -- I understand that you guys have made the adjustment in terms of your financials and expectations. But I assume that contract is still going as is while we wait for the CAD tribunal to make a vision and then potentially other appeals processes. Is that correct? Are you taking the price it now?\nGreg Brown : That's right. We're still delivering the services. We're still investing in the network. We're still doing all the things that are expected of us to deliver superior reliable emergency communication services. We've referenced this to your point. We did start the deferral of revenue on Airwave on August 1. So we're deferring that revenue through the balance of this year. And that informs about $200 million of incremental revenue headwinds for next year. Airwave all in is about $110 million or $115 million of that with a balance of $85 million or so being ESN. So we are obligated to recognize that accounting consistent with the price control of final remedies order, and we're doing that. If there's a different outcome, then we would change that accordingly. \nGeorge Notter : Thank you. \nGreg Brown : Thanks, George. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. \nKeith Housum : Good morning, guys and great question. In terms of the supply chain issues that you guys have had in terms of the semiconductor chips, where do we stand with that? I mean, do we still have a significant backlog of chips that might carry over into next year? Or is that largely caught up?\nJason Winkler : Keith, thanks for the question. The supply chain environment for our needs for chips, which I'll remind everyone is for generally 40 nanometers and above is improving, although it's not to levels of normality. For example, lead times for certain chips are now approaching 25-26 weeks where they had been double that, but in a normal environment, they should be 15 or 16.  So improvements, yes, and that's what's helping us drive the favorability of now $70 million in the P&L, but still some opportunity to improve further, and that's what's incorporated into our expectations for Q4 that we'll continue to use the tools that we've been using for a number of quarters now, looking for substitutes, working with our supplier partners and using the available supply that we can find at lower prices. \nGreg Brown : And we would, Jason, continued to see PPV benefit in '24 as well.\nJason Winkler : Yeah. Next year, as we told you on the last call, we're planning for about $60 million of '24 incremental PPP relief over '23. So we still have opportunity to capture there and expect that in the P&L. And again, that aligns to our expectations that things will continue to improve into '24.\nKeith Housum : Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. If I can just follow up, M&A has been a key part of motor-oil strategy over the years. As you're looking forward, I mean, is there anticipation that you're going to keep with some of these small tuck-in acquisitions? Or is there an appetite for perhaps a larger more transformational acquisition as well?\nGreg Brown : Yeah. Well, we certainly are in great shape from a balance sheet standpoint and the firepower to do some things inorganically. It's ironic, Keith, because here was sitting in November, and we have not done an acquisition yet to date. That is certainly not for a lack of an active and a fulsome funnel, but we've been pretty diligent and quite frankly, some sellers have been reluctant at prices that we thought would be more reasonably valued. That's okay.  Having said that, do I anticipate some continued M&A tuck-in activity, I do and the team, Raj, Mahesh, Jack, Jason, Michael, Anas [ph] are actively working that funnel. I think we still probably emphasize in general, services and video security and access control as areas of probably higher priority than others that we would look to do inorganically. And if there's something larger for us to consider, we would evaluate that as well clear eyed, but balance both financially and strategically, and we'll see what comes.\nKeith Housum : Great. Thank you. \nGreg Brown : Thanks, Keith. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open. \nAdam Tindle : Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats on the results. Greg, I wanted to start with backlog, again, record levels. Just I guess the heart of the question would be how long do you think this can continue? Do you think we're going to exit this year with record backlog again? Or when do you expect to see maybe some level of attenuation or normalization slowing in backlog based on what your business looks like right now?\nGreg Brown : Yeah, I certainly wouldn't speculate on backlog because I don't have a crystal ball. Having said that. Q3, we ended record backlog. Q3 was also a record quarter's quarter. So I love the funnel. I love our conversion. I love the record orders, and I think we're well positioned. By the way, when I look at the quality of the backlog in terms of aged or duration that remains strong as well. As Jason said, we still have to navigate supply chain on the semiconductor front. It's not normalized. Lead times remain elevated.  But at the end of the day, I like our end markets. I think they're pretty resilient. I like the demand and criticality for what we do, i.e., public safety and enterprise security informed by video security and access control as well as all the great work Mahesh is doing on the product side, in Command Center.  So we'll see where we're at. But as we sit here in November, do I like how we're entering into 2024? Absolutely. And if there's any changes to that, obviously, we'll update you in February.\nAdam Tindle : Got it. Okay. And then as we think about that backlog converting to revenue, obviously, supply chain is still challenged, but starting to get better, and I'm wondering what that could ultimately mean for 2024 growth in various scenarios. Obviously, I'm not guiding to that. I hear you on the 10/5 [ph], but if supply were to kind of free up in a blue-sky scenario, are you looking at high single-digit growth or better? What are the kind of the different scenarios based on potential backlog converting to revenue?\nGreg Brown : Yes. I think I would just stick to the 10/5 as a general high-level anticipated marker and reserve any additional color on either technologies or segments for the February conversation. But again, Adam, and I appreciate the question. But all I would tell you is I feel very good about going into 2024, and we'll update you in about 90 days.\nAdam Tindle : Okay. Yeah. Understood. I know you like to stay conservative, which I think we all appreciate. Maybe just 1 final point on this for Jason. As this backlog comes through, can you maybe speak to the margin profile of that? I can't remember if you're a FIFO or LIFO, but there may be some benefit from higher priced backlog coming through and would think that would potentially help margins moving forward. But any finer point you can put on the mechanics of that would be helpful. Thanks. \nJason Winkler : Sure. So beginning in Q3 of last year is when our P&L began to see the benefits of the work that Jack and his team did around strategic pricing. We've seen that continue in the back half of last year as well as the entirety of this year. So continue to focus on price and optimization and some of our new products, which customers really like also come at a price increase for us.  So in terms of backlog, we prioritize around, first of all, customers -- priority goes to public safety. But for the most part, the backlog that we do have in products is representative of the prices that we've implemented CIRCA July of last year. So you've seen it show up in the P&L, and we would expect that to continue with our growth being driven by both volume and price.\nGreg Brown : And I think we do expect operating margin next year.\nJason Winkler : Absolutely. Yes, exactly.\nAdam Tindle : Okay. Appreciate the clarification. Thanks, guys. \nJason Winkler : Thanks. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tomer Zilberman with Bank of America. Your line is now open. \nTomer Zilberman : Hey, guys. Thank you for the question. Just the first one for me. So your revenue outperformance this quarter versus street expectations really shown through LMR and Command Center. But it looks like you fell a little bit short on a Video product and SI. Can you talk about the weakness there? What drove the 5% growth this quarter?\nJohn Molloy : Sure. Thanks, Tomer. So first of all, I want to highlight the fact that we're actually really pleased with Q3 because the 8% is against the backdrop of a comp last Q3 of 33%. So our full year expectations remain unchanged. It's really a linearity story. And I think leaving that, I think we take a look at it and say, from an alignment standpoint from the portfolio investments, we just announced the H6A camera.  We're now shipping the ACC8, which is a unified video management solution. And then more importantly, if you think about the verticals that we serve, it's government, which has shown resilience in funding, it's education is health care and industrial, which has actually grew 17% for us this quarter. We're really pleased, and we think there's good synergies on the investments we're making in the markets that we serve.\nGreg Brown : And Tom, I think you said 5% per video, as Jack said.\nJohn Molloy : Actually 8%, over 33%.\nGreg Brown : 33% comp. In terms of the segment, S&S, of 5, I remind you that includes the decrement and deferral of Airwave revenue, which is important and compresses that. But at the same time, we continue to have great performance in command center software with the strong print for Q3. We have strong managed services performance and something that's not even reflected in Q3 is Denmark. And Molloy's team did a fabulous job on a multiyear project and multiyear managed services contract to close on Denmark. So I think that also should inform how you interpret the S&S performance.\nTomer Zilberman : Got it. And if I can just follow up. In terms of your 4Q and your fiscal guidance, I'm sure this is just something more with language than anything your 4Q guidance of 4% implies the higher end of your revamped fiscal guidance, while the low end of your fiscal guidance would imply around 3.5% growth for 4Q. So can you just talk about what would draw -- what could happen that would draw that incremental 0.5 point weakness?\nGreg Brown : Yeah. I think what I would say, Tomer, is I kind of focus on the approximately 4%. I understand the math differences of how you disaggregated it. But we're looking and anticipate 4% revenue growth for Q4. By the way, that's in the face of $105 million of headwind for Q4, $50 million, which is the Airwave deferral that's in that growth, $40 million, which is the business -- light business model, change that we informed you on a couple of months ago, a couple of quarters ago. And there's $15 million of additional FX headwinds.  So the 4% is actually a pretty healthy quarter that we're pretty proud of, and that's why we're raising the full year accordingly as well. \nTomer Zilberman : Great. Thank you. \nGreg Brown : Thanks, Tomer. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. \nMeta Marshall : Great, thanks. I just wanted to dive into a couple of your comments on the call. You guys noted that Rave was doing very well. Is that more customers coming on? Is that you're able to kind of cross-sell it, upsizing other products along with it. Just kind of where some of that Rave strength coming from. And then maybe on the federal side as well, I noted you talked about the $75 million P25 deal, but just -- is that a broadening of agencies, just faster refreshes, just kind of commentary on the two sources of upside this quarter would be helpful. Thanks. \nMahesh Saptharishi : Just to start out with on the integration piece, we announced a quarter ago, I believe, at this point, where we are bundling Rave with all our new Vesta offers going forward. There's an integration between our call handling solution and Rave as well. We have deeper penetration into the education market with our integration with Orchestrate and with our Video solutions, panic button being a big part of it. We integrated the Panic Button Rave elements with Aware, the command center Aware, for real-time prime center. So all of that acts as a very positive synergy, and I think that helps with the really accelerating rate adoption across the board.\nJohn Molloy : As it relates to federal, we're having a record year. And as you know, the federal government closed just occurred September 30. We're seeing it, it's broad-based. It's Department of Defense. It's civil, it's law enforcement, it's multiyear. So we're really pleased with what happened in federal. And then when you start to think about some of the federal supplemental requests, one of the items in there is $106 billion for the critical national security, which is going to fund Ukraine and Israel. What I would highlight is during the course of this year, we've actually shipped $100 million into Ukraine, a little greater than $100 million at this point in time.  So as you think about it, everything related to federal, Joe Balchen, John Zidar and their team have really done a job we're really pleased with.\nJason Winkler : And just to remind everybody, the size and scale of our federal business last year was 7% of our total revenues. This year, it's trending slightly higher than that. It's an important market for us. And it remains an area of focus, but it's smaller than state and local.\nJohn Molloy : One final thing that we've talked about is around the NDA and Secure Communications Act that has essentially been an unfunded mandate. And now there's $450 million for the cybersecurity state and local grant, it's going to fund rip and replace, which should be beneficial from a camera business standpoint.\nMeta Marshall : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. This is Brian [indiscernible] on for Ben. I was wondering if you could update us on the APX NEXT refresh cycle, kind of where we are in that and how you see that playing out into '24 and '25?\nJohn Molloy : Sure. So in 2 words, I'd say, momentum acceleration. We're now received of $600 million of orders since our introduction in late 2020. We actually did $100 million of orders in Q3 '23. I think the thing we're most pleased with is we're having good success within major cities, but we're now starting to see smaller state and local customers place orders against us. I would attribute a few things. It's a lot of the basics, I would call world-class ergonomics, audio quality. But the game changer for us has really been the application adoption customers, the demand to have location that works hand in glove with our command center software and Rave solution, the ease of use by way of smart programming and then the ability to extend the network through SmartConnect have really been a game changer.  I think we look at it and say they're -- when we look at our portfolio, APX NEXT family and radios, there's really nothing like it in the public safety domain. I think you asked a follow-on question around 20. We've typically said our LMR business and the device plays into that as it's a mid-single-digit kind of business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And one follow-up, if I could, on the Surveillance business. I think you called out incremental verticals getting involved there, but we would love to hear your perspective on the mix between commercial and public sector and surveillance and kind of how that's shifted and where it's going?\nJohn Molloy : Sure. So public safety is now one of our two largest vertical markets in terms of video security. And I'd remind everybody that when we acquired Avigilon, that was essentially a nascent business. So that's been the function of our sales team's ability to take a new portfolio in the government. So that's the first thing. In the enterprise, our business in enterprise, particularly in video security and access control is a little different than most. It's really centered around safety and security. The primary verticals that we touch there, as we've said, is education. It's health care. And then business around energy production and utilities and transportation, which have all grown as well. Those are really the core verticals for that business in the enterprise space.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Joe Cardoso with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. \nJoe Cardoso : Hey, good afternoon. And thanks for the questions. I actually just want to follow up on the APX NEXT comment and the momentum you're seeing there in combo with the LMR growing mid-single digits. We're just coming up against some quarters with tough compares. So I just wanted to -- just curious or maybe it's more of a clarification. If you think that mid-single-digit growth is sustainable even on top of the difficult compares over the next couple of quarters? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nJason Winkler : So our portfolio is refreshing itself around APX NEXT, as Jack mentioned, $600 million of orders since introduction in 2020. And we have continued to invest in other parts of the portfolio, too, like Tetra and others. So we're at still early stages of device refresh. And while having had a number of good quarters and continued demand, we would expect to continue to be able to grow that business as well as, as I mentioned earlier, the pricing strategy that supports the investments that we make, and we spend a sizable amount of R&D to innovate and advance the portfolio should lead to continued growth in the next year. \nJoe Cardoso : Got it. That's great. And then my follow-up actually on free cash flow. You had another solid quarter here. It appears that tailwinds are materializing, example being the elevated levels of inventories that we've seen over the past couple of quarters, that's coming down a bit. I guess if we take a step back and we starting to cycle past some of the choppy free cash flow generation we've seen over the past couple of quarters, just given kind of that dynamic macro environment and returning more to a consistency type of level we've seen in the past relative to conversions.  Any thoughts on whether the level of shareholder return can be maintained or accelerated going forward, just given working capital, improving the momentum behind the business, et cetera? Thanks, guys. \nJason Winkler : Sure. So I'll start with this year. I mentioned that we're solidly on track to deliver on the $1.9 billion in cash flow. That was an aggressive plan that we set at the beginning of the year. We mentioned in February that, that included $300 million of higher cash taxes over 2022. And with cash flow at this point through three quarters being up, we are well positioned to deliver on that $1.9 billion.  You're also right in that our inventory levels continue to come down. They're down $200 million from this point last year. They're down $85 million sequentially, and they're still at $950 million. So as we look into next year and the opportunities, we envision continued opportunity to balance investments in inventory with record backlog and working capital optimization into the future.\nJoe Cardoso : Got it. Thanks for all the color. \nGreg Brown : Thanks, Joe. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks.\nGreg Brown : So first of all, thanks for everybody dialing in and listening, but also thank you to everybody at Motorola Solutions, a great quarter, great execution. A lot of moving parts, but I love the team we've assembled, and I love the collaboration and pristine focus we have, both balancing results and investing for the long term.  I also would say in closing that in a world of challenging and increasing threats, I think the investments we've made in safety and security are as important as ever. We -- in effect, when you think about what we do, we are solving for safer. We're solving for safer communities, safer schools, safer hospitals, safer stadiums. And we do that by linking and integrating public safety with private organizations and private institutions to ensure that the solutions that we deliver and provision and the bidirectional customized workflow within them, protect people, property and places. Again, I'm proud of everybody. I think the outlook for our business is strong. Record orders, record backlog, a robust funnel, lots to do, but also lots of opportunity as well. Look forward to talking to you in February. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

            "name": "Jason Winkler",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 8% and was above our guidance with growth in both segments both regions and all three technologies. FX tailwinds during the quarter were $13 million while acquisitions added $19 million. GAAP operating earnings were $639 million or 25% of sales up from 15.7% in the year ago quarter, which had the impact of the $147 million fixed asset impairment charge related to our exit from the ESN contract in the UK.  Non-GAAP operating earnings were $741 million, up 10% From the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 29%, up 50 basis points driven by higher sales, lower material costs and improved operating leverage partially offset by a higher mix of international product shipments and the revenue deferral related to Airwave.  GAAP earnings per share was $2.70, up from $1.63 in the year ago quarter, which has the impact of the ESN asset impairment. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.19 up 6% from $3 per share last year. The growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins, partially offset by the Airwave deferral and a higher effective tax rate in the current year. OpEx in Q3 was $551 million, up $29 million versus last year primarily due to acquisitions and higher employee incentives in the current year.  Turning to cash flow, Q3 operating cash flow was $714 million up $326 million versus last year and free cash flow was $649 million of $331 million. The increase in year-over-year cash flow was primarily driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. And with our Q3 year-to-date operating cash flow of $799 million, up significantly from last year, we are solidly on track to deliver on our $1.9 billion of operating cash flow outlook for this year.  Capital allocation for Q3 included $147 million in cash dividends $322 million in share repurchases and $65 million of CapEx.  Moving to segments. In the Products and SI segment, sales were up 5% versus last year driven by growth in both LMR and video. Currency tailwinds were $4 million, and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $1 million. Operating earnings for the segment were $420 million or 26.1% of sales, up from 24.5% in the prior year driven by higher sales, lower direct material costs and improved operating leverage, partially offset by mix.  Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in the Product segment include a $75 million P25 device order for a U.S. federal customer, a $55 million P25 System order for a Southeast Asia customer, a $42 million P25 device order for the Texas Department of Public Safety, a $30 million P25 device order for a U.S. federal customer, a $20 million P25 device order for Indiana State Police and a $3 million fixed video expansion order for a U.S. federal customer.  In software and services, revenue was up 12% inclusive of the Airwave deferral with 31% growth in Command Center and 15% growth in Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $18 million in the quarter, and FX tailwinds were $9 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $321 million, up 7% versus last year and operating margins were 34%, down from 35.7% last year. Excluding the Airwave deferral, operating margins for the segment were up, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage.  Some notable Q3 highlights in this segment include a $23 million LMR service agreement for a large European customer, a $23 million service agreement for East Bay regional communication systems in California, a $20 million LMR service agreement for the Los Angeles Police Department, a $12 million command center order for Tarrant County 911 District in Texas and an $8 million body-worn camera order for the Metro Nashville Police. Looking at our regional results. North America Q3 revenue was $1.8 billion, up 6% on growth in all three technologies. International Q3 revenue was $773 million, up 13% versus last year driven by growth in LMR and Video. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q3 record of $14.3 billion, up 6% or $764 million versus last year, inclusive of $321 million of favorable currency rates driven by strong demand in North America. Sequentially, backlog was down $4 million, inclusive of $125 million of unfavorable FX, driven by the revenue recognition of Airwave, partially offset by strong demand in North America. In Products and SI, ending backlog was up $62 million or 1% versus last year, driven primarily by strong demand in North America. And sequentially, backlog was up $80 million, also driven by strong demand in North America. In Software and Services, backlog increased $702 million compared to last year, inclusive of $294 million of favorable FX driven by strong demand for multiyear software and services contracts in North America, partially offset by the revenue recognition for Airwave. Sequentially, backlog was down $84 million, driven by unfavorable FX of $96 million, partially offset by growth in multiyear Software and Services contracts in North America. Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales growth of approximately 4%, with non-GAAP EPS between $3.60 and $3.65 per share. This assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%.  For the full year, we are again increasing both our revenue and earnings guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $9.93 billion to $9.945 billion, up from our prior range of $9.875 billion to $9.9 billion, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.65 and $11.70, up from our prior guide of $11.40 to $11.48 per share. The full year outlook assumes $40 million of FX headwinds, up $25 million from our prior guidance. A weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%. Before I turn the call back to Greg, I'd like to highlight two points. In addition to the strength of our LMR and Video business, our Command Center portfolio performed well during the quarter. In Q3, we achieved strong growth, complemented by a robust contribution from Rave, an acquisition, which continues to exceed our expectations.  Secondly, our supply chain execution navigating extended lead times for some semiconductors and reducing broker purchases continues to drive year-over-year cost savings. We now expect the impact of lower broker purchases to be a $70 million tailwind for this year, up from our prior estimate of $60 million. As a result, we now expect full year operating margin expansion of approximately 200 basis points, up from our prior guidance of 175 basis points.  I'll now turn the call back to Greg. Tim, on backlog, we remain in a strong backlog position with an 8% revenue print in Q3 and backlog of $14 billion or more being up 6%. Our backlog is very strong. And I'd also point out that our backlog comes over 95% of it from government customers, who buy what they need, when they need it and count on us to deliver it. So we remain -- and Q3 orders inbound in Q3, inbound orders were also strong. So our backlog position is one of strength and Greg, I'll turn it to you for further comments. Keith, thanks for the question. The supply chain environment for our needs for chips, which I'll remind everyone is for generally 40 nanometers and above is improving, although it's not to levels of normality. For example, lead times for certain chips are now approaching 25-26 weeks where they had been double that, but in a normal environment, they should be 15 or 16.  So improvements, yes, and that's what's helping us drive the favorability of now $70 million in the P&L, but still some opportunity to improve further, and that's what's incorporated into our expectations for Q4 that we'll continue to use the tools that we've been using for a number of quarters now, looking for substitutes, working with our supplier partners and using the available supply that we can find at lower prices. Yeah. Next year, as we told you on the last call, we're planning for about $60 million of '24 incremental PPP relief over '23. So we still have opportunity to capture there and expect that in the P&L. And again, that aligns to our expectations that things will continue to improve into '24. Sure. So beginning in Q3 of last year is when our P&L began to see the benefits of the work that Jack and his team did around strategic pricing. We've seen that continue in the back half of last year as well as the entirety of this year. So continue to focus on price and optimization and some of our new products, which customers really like also come at a price increase for us.  So in terms of backlog, we prioritize around, first of all, customers -- priority goes to public safety. But for the most part, the backlog that we do have in products is representative of the prices that we've implemented CIRCA July of last year. So you've seen it show up in the P&L, and we would expect that to continue with our growth being driven by both volume and price. Absolutely. Yes, exactly. Thanks. And just to remind everybody, the size and scale of our federal business last year was 7% of our total revenues. This year, it's trending slightly higher than that. It's an important market for us. And it remains an area of focus, but it's smaller than state and local. So our portfolio is refreshing itself around APX NEXT, as Jack mentioned, $600 million of orders since introduction in 2020. And we have continued to invest in other parts of the portfolio, too, like Tetra and others. So we're at still early stages of device refresh. And while having had a number of good quarters and continued demand, we would expect to continue to be able to grow that business as well as, as I mentioned earlier, the pricing strategy that supports the investments that we make, and we spend a sizable amount of R&D to innovate and advance the portfolio should lead to continued growth in the next year. Sure. So I'll start with this year. I mentioned that we're solidly on track to deliver on the $1.9 billion in cash flow. That was an aggressive plan that we set at the beginning of the year. We mentioned in February that, that included $300 million of higher cash taxes over 2022. And with cash flow at this point through three quarters being up, we are well positioned to deliver on that $1.9 billion.  You're also right in that our inventory levels continue to come down. They're down $200 million from this point last year. They're down $85 million sequentially, and they're still at $950 million. So as we look into next year and the opportunities, we envision continued opportunity to balance investments in inventory with record backlog and working capital optimization into the future."

            "content": "Full year, I would say that we still expect our growth to be 20%. Look, our core platforms, that's NG-911, CAD, Records Aware, are all doing well as well. As Jason read out in the script, St. Charles, Missouri, just refreshed their call handling solution and adopted our [indiscernible] routing. And you see us solution, Western Australia Police refreshed their CAD. There's also an ecosystem story here. Rave is certainly performing well above our expectations. Arizona is now the 15th state to sign on to Rave Alert. It's a statewide mass notification system. And as we're doing that, we're also refreshing all the call handling instances across the PSAPs in Arizona. And our call handling system integrated with Rave as appropriate here as well.  When you think about a city like Glendale, Glendale now brings in radio, brings in CAD 911, Rave, et cetera, now into a state-of-the-art real-time crime center, all integrated with Aware. And now you can think about orchestration when major incidents happened on the heels of things like active shooter incidents, et cetera, that benefit from the fact that the ecosystem allows you to now respond much faster. Just to start out with on the integration piece, we announced a quarter ago, I believe, at this point, where we are bundling Rave with all our new Vesta offers going forward. There's an integration between our call handling solution and Rave as well. We have deeper penetration into the education market with our integration with Orchestrate and with our Video solutions, panic button being a big part of it. We integrated the Panic Button Rave elements with Aware, the command center Aware, for real-time prime center. So all of that acts as a very positive synergy, and I think that helps with the really accelerating rate adoption across the board."

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks everybody for joining us today. First, Q3 was another strong quarter with revenue and earnings per share exceeding our guidance driven by continued strong demand, and an improving supply chain environment. Revenue was up 8% in the quarter highlighted by 12% growth in software and services, and 5% growth in products and systems integration.  We also expanded operating margins for the fifth consecutive quarter, which resulted in record Q3 operating earnings in both segments and over $700 million of operating cash flow.  Second, investments in safety and security continue to be a priority for our customers. And we had another record orders quarter in Q3. Year-to-date orders are up 11% driven by strong software and services, record U.S. Federal demand and continued adoption of our APX NEXT device by U.S. state and local customers. Additionally, we ended Q3 with record backlog of $14.3 billion, up 6% versus the prior year. And finally, based on our Q3 results and continued momentum in the business, we are again raising our full year guidance for both sales and EPS for the third time this year.  I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Thanks, Jason. First, I'm really pleased with our Q3 results, which highlight the durability and criticality of our business and the strength of our portfolio. Revenue was up 8%, and that's inclusive of the revenue deferral related to Airwave that we've talked to you about already. We also achieved record operating earnings in both segments, record Q3 operating cash flow of over $700 million and a Q3 record backlog that is 6% higher than last year, which positions us well as we head into next year.  Second, the resilient nature of our business and strong cash flow allows us to continue to be flexible as we deploy capital to drive shareholder value. The strength of our cash flow comes from strong demand from product refresh, consistent margin expansion and improving cash conversion. Through October, we've repurchased just under $800 million of stock, highlighting our conviction in the long-term value of MSI.  We also ended the quarter with net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.7, which provides us with a healthy balance sheet and additional firepower to continue to invest both organically and consider inorganic investments as well. And finally, as we look to close out another record year, I think we're exceptionally well positioned for continued growth. Demand for our solutions remains robust. We're continuing to add value to our customers. Our end markets remain resilient, and our teams continue to execute at a high level.  I'll now turn the call over to Tim and welcome your questions accordingly. Just on Rave and then maybe Mahesh can jump in. I would tell you, Tim, I love the acquisition. I think it was well done by the internal team here that founded, did the diligence both technical strategic as well as financial. I love Todd Pyott and his entire team that's come over to the organization.  And the performance of Rave since joining Motorola has exceeded the business case and exceeded our expectations. Yeah. And Tim, as it relates to 2024, obviously, we'll wait until February to give specifics on any kind of detailed guidance. I would tell you, as we sit here today from a high level, we would estimate revenue, again, kind of back of the cocktail napkin to be about $10.5 billion at this point as we sit here today. By the way, that's inclusive of $250 million of incremental revenue headwinds, about $200 million of that out of the UK home office. We've talked to you about that before. The deferral of Airwave representing a little bit over $100 million, the balance of that being the formal exit of ESN for a total of $200 million related to the UK Home Office and anticipated FX headwinds of about $50 million.  So high level, as I sit here today and take a look -- that's kind of how I would dimensionalize next year and filling in more detail when we get together in February. Thank you, Tim. Yeah. On the UK, there's really no news to report, George. We had the hearing on August 2 and 3. I think we reiterated the strong case, we feel with a high level of conviction. And you've heard me use adjectives before. I'm very specific with how I would describe the situation. I think it's unprecedented. I think it's overreaching. It's entirely disproportionate, but we made the case.  And as a result, we're waiting on that CAD, that competition appeals tribunal, you referenced that ruling. It's a fairly opaque regulatory process. So I couldn't speculate 1 way or the other on how to interpret that. We'll wait to get it. I would anticipate getting it certainly between now and the end of the year. And as I've already said as well, if it, in turn, does not go our way, we will continue to exhaust all legal options to defend the position we have, provisioning and delivering outstanding and very reliable emergency communication services throughout the UK. That's right. We're still delivering the services. We're still investing in the network. We're still doing all the things that are expected of us to deliver superior reliable emergency communication services. We've referenced this to your point. We did start the deferral of revenue on Airwave on August 1. So we're deferring that revenue through the balance of this year. And that informs about $200 million of incremental revenue headwinds for next year. Airwave all in is about $110 million or $115 million of that with a balance of $85 million or so being ESN. So we are obligated to recognize that accounting consistent with the price control of final remedies order, and we're doing that. If there's a different outcome, then we would change that accordingly. Thanks, George. And we would, Jason, continued to see PPV benefit in '24 as well. Yeah. Well, we certainly are in great shape from a balance sheet standpoint and the firepower to do some things inorganically. It's ironic, Keith, because here was sitting in November, and we have not done an acquisition yet to date. That is certainly not for a lack of an active and a fulsome funnel, but we've been pretty diligent and quite frankly, some sellers have been reluctant at prices that we thought would be more reasonably valued. That's okay.  Having said that, do I anticipate some continued M&A tuck-in activity, I do and the team, Raj, Mahesh, Jack, Jason, Michael, Anas [ph] are actively working that funnel. I think we still probably emphasize in general, services and video security and access control as areas of probably higher priority than others that we would look to do inorganically. And if there's something larger for us to consider, we would evaluate that as well clear eyed, but balance both financially and strategically, and we'll see what comes. Thanks, Keith. Yeah, I certainly wouldn't speculate on backlog because I don't have a crystal ball. Having said that. Q3, we ended record backlog. Q3 was also a record quarter's quarter. So I love the funnel. I love our conversion. I love the record orders, and I think we're well positioned. By the way, when I look at the quality of the backlog in terms of aged or duration that remains strong as well. As Jason said, we still have to navigate supply chain on the semiconductor front. It's not normalized. Lead times remain elevated.  But at the end of the day, I like our end markets. I think they're pretty resilient. I like the demand and criticality for what we do, i.e., public safety and enterprise security informed by video security and access control as well as all the great work Mahesh is doing on the product side, in Command Center.  So we'll see where we're at. But as we sit here in November, do I like how we're entering into 2024? Absolutely. And if there's any changes to that, obviously, we'll update you in February. Yes. I think I would just stick to the 10/5 as a general high-level anticipated marker and reserve any additional color on either technologies or segments for the February conversation. But again, Adam, and I appreciate the question. But all I would tell you is I feel very good about going into 2024, and we'll update you in about 90 days. And I think we do expect operating margin next year. And Tom, I think you said 5% per video, as Jack said. 33% comp. In terms of the segment, S&S, of 5, I remind you that includes the decrement and deferral of Airwave revenue, which is important and compresses that. But at the same time, we continue to have great performance in command center software with the strong print for Q3. We have strong managed services performance and something that's not even reflected in Q3 is Denmark. And Molloy's team did a fabulous job on a multiyear project and multiyear managed services contract to close on Denmark. So I think that also should inform how you interpret the S&S performance. Yeah. I think what I would say, Tomer, is I kind of focus on the approximately 4%. I understand the math differences of how you disaggregated it. But we're looking and anticipate 4% revenue growth for Q4. By the way, that's in the face of $105 million of headwind for Q4, $50 million, which is the Airwave deferral that's in that growth, $40 million, which is the business -- light business model, change that we informed you on a couple of months ago, a couple of quarters ago. And there's $15 million of additional FX headwinds.  So the 4% is actually a pretty healthy quarter that we're pretty proud of, and that's why we're raising the full year accordingly as well. Thanks, Tomer. Thanks, Joe. So first of all, thanks for everybody dialing in and listening, but also thank you to everybody at Motorola Solutions, a great quarter, great execution. A lot of moving parts, but I love the team we've assembled, and I love the collaboration and pristine focus we have, both balancing results and investing for the long term.  I also would say in closing that in a world of challenging and increasing threats, I think the investments we've made in safety and security are as important as ever. We -- in effect, when you think about what we do, we are solving for safer. We're solving for safer communities, safer schools, safer hospitals, safer stadiums. And we do that by linking and integrating public safety with private organizations and private institutions to ensure that the solutions that we deliver and provision and the bidirectional customized workflow within them, protect people, property and places. Again, I'm proud of everybody. I think the outlook for our business is strong. Record orders, record backlog, a robust funnel, lots to do, but also lots of opportunity as well. Look forward to talking to you in February. Thanks."

            "name": "John Molloy",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Tomer. So first of all, I want to highlight the fact that we're actually really pleased with Q3 because the 8% is against the backdrop of a comp last Q3 of 33%. So our full year expectations remain unchanged. It's really a linearity story. And I think leaving that, I think we take a look at it and say, from an alignment standpoint from the portfolio investments, we just announced the H6A camera.  We're now shipping the ACC8, which is a unified video management solution. And then more importantly, if you think about the verticals that we serve, it's government, which has shown resilience in funding, it's education is health care and industrial, which has actually grew 17% for us this quarter. We're really pleased, and we think there's good synergies on the investments we're making in the markets that we serve. Actually 8%, over 33%. As it relates to federal, we're having a record year. And as you know, the federal government closed just occurred September 30. We're seeing it, it's broad-based. It's Department of Defense. It's civil, it's law enforcement, it's multiyear. So we're really pleased with what happened in federal. And then when you start to think about some of the federal supplemental requests, one of the items in there is $106 billion for the critical national security, which is going to fund Ukraine and Israel. What I would highlight is during the course of this year, we've actually shipped $100 million into Ukraine, a little greater than $100 million at this point in time.  So as you think about it, everything related to federal, Joe Balchen, John Zidar and their team have really done a job we're really pleased with. One final thing that we've talked about is around the NDA and Secure Communications Act that has essentially been an unfunded mandate. And now there's $450 million for the cybersecurity state and local grant, it's going to fund rip and replace, which should be beneficial from a camera business standpoint. Sure. So in 2 words, I'd say, momentum acceleration. We're now received of $600 million of orders since our introduction in late 2020. We actually did $100 million of orders in Q3 '23. I think the thing we're most pleased with is we're having good success within major cities, but we're now starting to see smaller state and local customers place orders against us. I would attribute a few things. It's a lot of the basics, I would call world-class ergonomics, audio quality. But the game changer for us has really been the application adoption customers, the demand to have location that works hand in glove with our command center software and Rave solution, the ease of use by way of smart programming and then the ability to extend the network through SmartConnect have really been a game changer.  I think we look at it and say they're -- when we look at our portfolio, APX NEXT family and radios, there's really nothing like it in the public safety domain. I think you asked a follow-on question around 20. We've typically said our LMR business and the device plays into that as it's a mid-single-digit kind of business. Sure. So public safety is now one of our two largest vertical markets in terms of video security. And I'd remind everybody that when we acquired Avigilon, that was essentially a nascent business. So that's been the function of our sales team's ability to take a new portfolio in the government. So that's the first thing. In the enterprise, our business in enterprise, particularly in video security and access control is a little different than most. It's really centered around safety and security. The primary verticals that we touch there, as we've said, is education. It's health care. And then business around energy production and utilities and transportation, which have all grown as well. Those are really the core verticals for that business in the enterprise space."

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter with revenue and earnings per share both exceeding our guidance. In Software and Services, revenue was up 13% and operating earnings were up 15%, driven by strong growth across all three technologies. And in Products and Systems Integration, continued robust demand and improved supply chain availability led to a 12% growth in revenue and a 52% growth in operating earnings in the segment. Additionally, we ended the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog of $14.3 billion, up approximately $850 million versus last year, and also up approximately $200 million sequentially. Second, our exceptional performance during the quarter was broad-based, with double-digit revenue growth in both segments both regions and in all three technologies, including 20% growth in Command Center and 17% growth in Video Security. We also saw record Q2 orders in both segments during the quarter, driven by customers prioritizing technology investments to strengthen public safety and enterprise security. And finally, based on our Q2 results and the continued strong demand we\u2019re seeing across the business, we\u2019re again raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 12% and was above our guidance with double-digit growth in both segments, both regions and in all three technologies. FX headwinds during the quarter were $23 million, while acquisitions added $20 million. GAAP operating earnings were $518 million or 21.6% of sales, up from 16.7% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $641 million, up 29% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%, up 350 basis points. The strong year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales, inclusive of our higher prices, pricing, lower direct material costs and improved operating leverage. GAAP earnings per share was $2.15 compared to $1.33 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.65, up 28% from $2.07 last year. This strong growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. OpEx in Q2 was $555 million, up $53 million versus last year, primarily due to increased expenses from acquisitions, investments in video and higher employee-related incentives in the current year. Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $93 million, up $83 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $40 million, up $89 million. The increase in year-over-year cash flow was primarily driven by higher earnings and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes. For the full year, we continue to expect approximately $1.9 billion of operating cash flow. The linearity of our cash flow is expected to be consistent with last year with higher earnings and improved working capital driving increased cash flow in the second half. Also, as we previously highlighted, this year\u2019s cash flow includes approximately $300 million of additional cash taxes compared to last year, inclusive of a one-time $70 million tax payment that relates to an IP reorganization that we did in 2022. Capital allocation in Q2 included $224 million in share repurchases, $148 million in cash dividends and $53 million of CapEx. Moving to segment results. In the Products and SI segment, sales were up 12% versus last year, driven by improved supply availability in the current year and the benefit from pricing actions continuing to flow through. Currency headwinds were $10 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $2 million. Operating earnings were $285 million or 19.8% of sales, up from 14.6% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, lower material costs, inclusive of lower broker spend for semiconductors and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include $145 million P25 system upgrade for Kern County, California. A $41 million P25 system and device order for a U.S. federal customer, a $31 million P25 system expansion for Ventura County, California, a $19 million P25 device order for a U.S. federal customer and a $6 million fixed video order for a large U.S. healthcare customer. In Software and Services, revenue was up 13%, including 20% growth in Command Center and 19% growth in Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $18 million in the quarter, and FX headwinds were $13 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $356 million, up 15% versus last year and operating margins were 36.9%, up from 36.1% last year. On higher sales and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher costs from acquisitions. Some notable Q2 highlights in this segment include a $34 million video order for the Virginia State Police, which included our largest in-car video order ever, a $15 million LMR services agreement with City of Baltimore, Maryland, a $13 million managed services agreement for LMR and a renewal in Latin America; a $12 million Command Center order for a U.S. federal customer and an $8 million LMR service agreement with another U.S. federal customer. Looking at regional results for the company, North America Q2 revenue was $1.6 billion, up 11% on strong growth in all three technologies. International Q2 revenue was $762 million, up 16% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog was a Q2 record of $14.3 billion, up 6% or $856 million versus last year, driven by strong demand in all three technologies. Sequentially, backlog was up $211 million, driven by record Q2 orders in both segments. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $496 million or 11% and year-over-year and up $100 million sequentially, driven primarily by strong LMR demand. In Software and Services, backlog was up $360 million compared to last year, driven by strong demand for multiyear software and services contracts in North America, partially offset by revenue recognition for Airwave and the adjustment related to the ESN contract exit. Sequentially, backlog was up $111 million, driven by record Q2 orders in the segment. Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 6% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.99 and $3.04 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. For the full year, we are again increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $9.875 billion to $9.9 billion, up from our prior range of $9.725 billion to $9.775 billion, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.40 and $11.48 per share up from our prior guidance of $11.21 to $11.29 per share. This full year outlook assumes $25 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. Before turning it back to Greg, I wanted to provide some color on a few financial topics. First, an update on the CMA and Airwave. As we\u2019ve stated previously, we strongly disagree with the CMA\u2019s final decision. Earlier this week, the CMA issued its remedies order regarding implementation of their final decision effective on August 1. This procedural next step does not change our position regarding the ongoing appeal process and our strong belief in our case. However, from an accounting perspective, beginning August 1, we will now defer revenue for the amount above the remedies order price control until the appeals process has been completed. This deferral and resulting lower revenue from Airwave for the remainder of the year is fully incorporated into our increased revenue and earnings guidance for the year. Second, earlier this week, Moody\u2019s upgraded our credit from two Baa2 from Baa3. This higher credit rating underscores the strength of our balance sheet, including the strong liquidity position, our balanced debt maturity profile, significantly improved pension status, along with a track record of consistently growing earnings and cash flow. And finally, our increased guidance for the year highlights the strength of our business as we enter the second half. Our backlog is exceptionally strong, driven by robust customer demand. And based on our current pipeline and supply chain environment, we expect backlog to remain strong going forward. Additionally, the expected lower semiconductors we articulated in February, the cost related to these semiconductors coupled with the pricing adjustments in our own portfolio that were implemented in the second half of last year are driving the significant full year margin expansion of approximately 175 basis points. That is implied in our increased guidance. I\u2019m now turning the call back to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Jason, thank you very much. First, our exceptional Q2 results highlight the continued strong momentum we\u2019re seeing across the business. We grew revenue double-digits in both segments, both regions, and in all three technologies. We expanded operating margins by 350 basis points, and we achieved record Q2 orders, which has led to our highest ending backlog ever for a second quarter, and is driving our increased guidance for the full year. Second, we continue to leverage our global installed base to sell more value-add Software and Services to our customers. During the quarter, Software and Services revenue was up 13% with strong growth in all three technologies. We also achieved record Q2 orders in this segment, highlighted by our largest in-car video order ever from the Virginia State Police that included automated license plate recognition and digital evidence management. And with our recent Rave acquisition, we\u2019ve made significant advances in integration across our ecosystem, which is driving strong pipeline demand for Rave together with our command center products. And finally, I just wanted to spend a little time and provide some color on artificial intelligence. We recognized AI and the potential impact it could have on our customers back a few years ago when we acquired Avigilon and its AI capabilities. And we\u2019ve seen and continue to see this technology driving opportunity for both our business and our customers. AI along with generative AI plays an important role in our solutions to help keep communities safe from actively analyzing live video and alerting humans when something important happens to assisting a 911 call with our live translation solution to automatically redacting evidence, these advancements improve response times, which can help save lives while also enhancing privacy for those involved. AI will continue to enhance how our solutions help protect people, property, and places. With our ongoing investments and deep expertise, we\u2019re very well-positioned in this space, and we expect to see increased adoption of these technologies from public safety, enterprises, and private organizations alike for a more proactive approach to safety and security. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Tim and we\u2019ll open it up for your questions.\nTim Yocum: Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I\u2019d like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTim Long: Thank you. I\u2019ll start with the clarification, Jason, one for you, Greg. Jason, yes, pretty impressive, you\u2019re raising numbers despite the change in accounting for Airwave. Just wanted to clarify there we got the new revenue level that was mandated and that you guys are accounting to. Can you just talk a little bit about expenses? I think you guys have run that network pretty efficiently. So should we assume a comparable expense level to how things have been running? Or is does something change on that side on the EPS impact? And then for Greg, if you could just talk a little bit about macro, it sounds like everything\u2019s going pretty well, but if you could just hit on kind of what you\u2019re seeing from the government customers and to what extent you\u2019re starting to see federal and ARPA type of dollars flowing into the business. That\u2019d be great. Thank you.\nJason Winkler: Thanks, Tim. So our expectations for Airwave revenues this year with the now deferred revenue effective August 1 are for about $480 million of revenue from Airwave. That\u2019ll be down from about $560 million last year. To answer your question on cost, we run that network and provide a service level. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate significant cost changes. Our cost to run that network and deliver the services are what they are. So we are deferring about $80 million in revenue this year and still raising our guidance from the last time we were together by about $140 million.\nGreg Brown: And to Jason\u2019s point, the $80 million reduction due to accounting and the required treatment of that from $560 million to $480 million is obviously all in the back half of the year starting August 1, running through the remainder of the year. As in terms of expenses and investment, we continue to invest in Airwave by the way, Tim just a few months ago the end users gave us feedback and network performance and reliability, which was as high as we\u2019ve ever achieved on Airwave. So we\u2019re proud of that and we continue to maintain and invest on behalf of our end users. In terms of macro, high level the business is as good as I\u2019ve ever seen it. The demand drivers are strong. Jack has talked about, and we\u2019ll talk a little bit about today if you want about device refresh. And interestingly, Tim, Molloy mentioned last year, we try to track demand against the orders achieved last year, and we believe as best we could tell less than 5% of our orders last year were tagged due to ARPA. Through the first half of this year, we also believe it\u2019s less than 5% as well. So the nice thing about this is, we\u2019re seeing demand drivers around public safety, video security, access control, command center, software and services that\u2019s really underpinning environmental and overall demand sure ARPA helps, but as best we could tell, it\u2019s fairly minimal.\nJack Molloy: I\u2019d agree with that, Greg. The only thing I\u2019d add to that, and I think you highlighted the benefits from a product standpoint, but from S&S standpoint, a year-over-year, we had a $360 million increase in backlog. In addition to that, we\u2019re in receipt of a contract from the State of Illinois for a $300 million frame agreement for a 10-year period for services. That\u2019s incremental and that\u2019s not reflected in our backlog, Tim. So I think that\u2019s just another proof point to the conversations we\u2019re having with customers really resonate for their needs right now.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGeorge Notter: Hi guys, thanks very much. I guess I wanted to ask about margins and profitability. I think at one point you guys were looking for about a $50 million benefit this year on lower brokers fees and expedite fees. I guess I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s still the expectation for this year. And then also I\u2019m curious about what the overall level of broker fees and expedite fees you\u2019re carrying for this year would look like. And when do those step back down? Would that be a 2024 event or when do you see relief there? Thanks.\nJason Winkler: Hi George, thanks for the question. So we began the year with an expectation for $50 million of lower costs related to premiums through brokers. We\u2019re trending a bit better than that. We\u2019re on path to about a $60 million year-over-year benefit largely in the first half. We\u2019re still spending some investments on brokers. As we look into next year, we would expect to comparable benefit level of about $60 million into 2024 for brokers. Again, the supply chain environment remains fluid. It\u2019s incrementally better, but we\u2019re still using the same tools we\u2019ve been using for over a year to make sure that we get the supplies that we need. The level of commitment from our suppliers is strong but their lead times remain elevated still. And so from time to time we will use PPV [ph] to secure the parts to match the record demand that we\u2019re seeing.\nGreg Brown: And I do have to say thanks to for all the engineers in Motorola, because as we manage PPV and to Jason\u2019s point, we\u2019ll achieve now $60 million, a little higher than $50 million\u2019s target. And we \u2013 that would be our goal for next year as well another $60 million. A lot of the engineers in Motorola have done real time under Molloy\u2019s leadership and Scott Mottonen and others. They\u2019ve done product redesign in a way that\u2019s allowed us to substitute parts in a matter of months that also have allowed the company to be adept and firm and responsive to our customers. And I just want everybody to know on the engineering community how grateful we are for that because they were \u2013 they\u2019ve been superstars.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, if I do the math, I think you\u2019re still caring about $150 million in annualized expedite fees or brokers fees. Is that right for this year?\nJason Winkler: Yes. This year\u2019s envelope is going to be a little less than that. It\u2019s more important that we \u2013 as we look at next year\u2019s envelope reducing by $60 million, that\u2019s our current thinking. As we go through supply planning, there\u2019s other offsets that are always in the mix around direct materials costs, some positive, some unfavorable. So as we look to next year, we see a $60 million benefit, particularly related to this opportunity from broker fees.\nGeorge Notter: Great. Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, George.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to start on Airwave. Just a clarification, admittedly, I think we\u2019re all outside our core competency and trying to read through these legal documents here, but $200 million in U.S. dollars. So I guess the first question would be just to understand how you came up with that $80 million headwind? And then secondly, what absent the appeal? What that number would go to in 2024 as we try to think about shaping our models for the worst case scenario?\nJason Winkler: Yes. So first of all, the beginning date of the deferral for revenue is consistent with the remedies order, which is August 1 to the end of the year. That\u2019s the approximately $80 million. If you do the math on that for next year it would \u2013 it\u2019d be approximately another $100 million step down. There are a variety of inputs that go into us servicing Airwave, the usage of the network, the one-time events that go with the network, the number of user communities that subscribe as well as inflation and other variables that go into how much revenue we recognize from the contract. All those things together last year $560 million, this year on path to $480 million and then you can do the math on the price control into next year for approximately another $100 million decline.\nAdam Tindle: For the full year, yes.\nJason Winkler: For the full year, correct.\nGreg Brown: And Adam, what I\u2019d say is like I think this process is proceeding as expected. So we knew that the CMA issued a final decision. In Q2, we knew it would be followed by a remedies order statutorily, they could have gone till October to do that as late as October. They did it now in light of the remedies implementation order, that requires the accounting treatment Jason just described. It doesn\u2019t change at all our belief and our confidence in this case, by the way. The hearing, the appeal to the competition appeals tribunal was yesterday and today. So that part is done as well. Now we will wait to see what they rule on the appeal. We have said and I\u2019ve said we\u2019ve been very consistent. We think this action is unprecedented overreaching. It effectively is opening up an already agreed on binding legal contract. But we\u2019ll see how it plays out, in the meantime, we\u2019ve deferred the revenue through the end of this year as required and to articulate and quantify what it could be. If nothing else changed, it would be another approximately $100 million deferral or reduction of Airwave on a full year basis next year.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. And that $100 million on revenue, would that also be about approximately that on the EBIT line or any way to think for us to think about EBIT on that a $100 million?\nJason Winkler: Yes, so as I mentioned to Tim, the cost structure and our needs to run this network haven\u2019t changed. So the lower revenue largely tracks to a lower a margin amount as well.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. Okay. Makes sense. And then absent that, obviously Greg, as you mentioned, the rest of the business is running in incredibly well. Notably, the PSI segment over 50% operating income growth on 12% revenue growth and I\u2019m looking at a first half margin near 20%, which is I think maybe even unprecedented for that segment in total for the first half. So I guess a question on that would be how do you see the margin trajectory of that piece of the business? I know it\u2019s been through a lot whether it was COVID and pandemic and all that. I wonder if you\u2019re coming out the other side with maybe a structurally improved margin profile and how you\u2019re thinking about the trajectory of that piece of business. Thanks.\nGreg Brown: First of all, I\u2019d say that, and again, I compliment the team, Jason, Jack, on the improved gross margins, both on cost of goods as well as \u2013 as you know, we\u2019ve taken a series of pricing actions starting last year and coming into this year. We view those pricing actions as sticky, not transient. So the margin profiles better. In terms of growth of LMR and the technology, we\u2019ve guided for the full year mid-single-digits, we still expect that to be appropriate full year guidance. We\u2019re coming off some monster comps in the first half of this year. And by the way, the Airwave accounting treatment of the $80 million reduction or deferral in revenue is in the back half of this year, that would be reflected in the LMR technology. Having said that, I\u2019m super proud of the gross margin expansion and operating margin expansion and while obviously we\u2019re sitting in August, so it\u2019s too early to talk about 2024, but it would be my and our expectations to grow operating margins in 2024 as well.\nJason Winkler: So it\u2019s important to note also in terms of the first half performance, and you\u2019re right, we had significant margin expansion in products. That\u2019s off of last year\u2019s first half, which included our highest broker costs as well as last year\u2019s first half didn\u2019t include our own pricing increases. So effective July 1 of last year in our second half, you saw significant on good growth, significant margin step up in the second half. That\u2019s continued through the first half of this year. And as we look to growth in our second half this year, we\u2019ll still have margin increases over those records from last year. And really that\u2019s a function of when we implemented the price increases and when the PPV or higher broker costs have come out of our product set.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll move next to Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nBen Bollin: Thanks. I appreciate you guys taking the question. Greg, I was hoping you could \u2013 you made the comment about the overall funding environment being so healthy. And I\u2019m not trying to get you to guide into 2024, but I\u2019m interested how you think about just public sector funding overall, the sources of income to public sector and how you think that\u2019s evolving as you look out over into 2024 and beyond.\nGreg Brown: Well, I like number one to your point, Ben, thanks for the question. The underlying demand drivers of the business are strong absent funding. Then you get the funding and I talked about the, as best we can tell, the percentage orders in terms of order volume attributed to ARPA is 5% or less. The other thing I like is the multi-year nature of state and local funding, which is $350 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act and $170 billion of education, which is an absolutely prioritized vertical for us and what Jack Molloy and his team are doing. So we\u2019re not going to guide on 2024, but the fact that we had the print we had and record Q2 orders and record Q2 ending backlog and improved 12-month duration of backlog. And the other thing Molloy and I track is pipeline, right? So what\u2019s the pipeline and funnel? What\u2019s the stuff coming in at the top? How are we doing on order conversion and velocity? And when Jack and I look at that, that\u2019s favorable as well. And in terms of the health of the overall state and local budgets, they remain strong too.\nJack Molloy: Thank you, Greg. And I think what I would say there is when we think about top of the pipeline being quoting, bottom of the pipeline being orders, and then the most important metric is the velocity between those two. The our velocity remains consistent. In fact, it\u2019s improved and we\u2019ve seen a growing number of quoting. So I think that portends well to 2024. The other thing that I think is lost in a lot of people when we think about government funding, we\u2019ve talked about ARPA. But when you think about personal income tax, corporate income tax and sales tax, those three funding streams have all been the beneficiary for government from inflation. So inflation for them means they get more tax receipts in. And their costs haven\u2019t necessarily gone in parallel. And I think a lot of people don\u2019t necessarily understand that, but I just wanted to mention that. So all things in, I think the funding environment and government remains very strong.\nBen Bollin: That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then Jack, I was hoping you could take us through how you see K-12 developing. If you could speak to the significance of the deal sizes themselves, the nature of the project that you\u2019re seeing, just any thoughts there would be helpful. And that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nJack Molloy: So, well, K-12 is \u2013 there\u2019s really two technologies. It\u2019s video security and access control. And depending on the type of school district, we\u2019ve seen an acceleration into our Alta, Avigilon Alta, which is cloud, but we\u2019ve also got larger school districts that continue to buy Unity. But the K-12 education in general, we put the marker in that our video business is growing 15% K-12 and the EDU market is, is surpassing that growth level. It did last year, and it continues to grow through the first half of this year very robustly. And I think some of that\u2019s the beneficiary of ARPA funding, but I think a lot of it is really much more \u2013 it\u2019s much more secular around school security and that it\u2019s getting prioritized over everything else.\nMahesh Saptharishi: One more thing maybe to add to that is just from a safety reimagine standpoint, we\u2019re also integrating Rave along with Orchestrate and Rave. We now have integrations going into aware with a panic button. We also have the capacity to integrate weapons detection. We also launched weapons detection for the school\u2019s market. So all in all, we have other headwinds come \u2013 tailwinds coming with us there to push the whole story from a school security standpoint.\nGreg Brown: Good point, Mahesh.\nMahesh Saptharishi: Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Joseph Cardoso with J.P. Morgan. Your light is open.\nJoseph Cardoso: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Just one for me. And maybe this is just kind of a broader picture question. The God embeds sort of a normal seasonality in the back half, at least relative to pre-COVID era. However, at the same time you guys are staring at a much larger backlog now, can you just walk us through the puts and takes around that why you\u2019re not seeing better seasonal trends as we kind of go through the back half and I guess particularly just given that you\u2019re seeing better supply headwinds \u2013 or sorry, seeing supply handlings ease more broadly, just curious whatever thoughts you have on that. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Yes. Joseph, just \u2013 I\u2019m sure Jason will jump in as well, but I remind you that, you\u2019re right. Normally, this business is typically Q3 and Q4 weighted and seasonally dense. I think that\u2019s unchanged. But remember, we\u2019re guiding an increase in top and bottom, even with the $80 million of Airwave deferral in the back half and another $50 million of PCR light business model change. Jason can elaborate on that. So that\u2019s $130 million of revenue growth that needs to be incorporated into the second half guide, but still informs and allows us to raise. And on the bottom EPS line we have an incremental $0.30 tax headwind, $0.50 for the year. We had $0.20 headwind, first half $0.30 of EPS structural tax headwind back half. So as you incorporate those ingredients into the blender, it shouldn\u2019t take away or distract at all that the demand is strong, the raise is strong and the momentum is strong.\nJason Winkler: So business model change in low end PCR we mentioned in February, we\u2019ve gone to a model where we only recognized the margin and the revenue in the product, no longer the COGS. So it\u2019s OE neutral, but did change the revenue line. That was a way to focus our business on higher value efforts. So that\u2019s something\u2026\nGreg Brown: And the choice, we\u2026\nJason Winkler: Choice we did in February and it\u2019s working out quite well. The other thing I\u2019d point you to is the lead times from our key semiconductor manufacturers and the commitments they give us for getting us the products and the semiconductors we need, support the increased guide and continue to represent opportunity for us as we go forward. But we get commitments from them and we plan the business and how much revenue we can unlock out of backlog based on that.\nJoseph Cardoso: Yes. Got it. Thanks. Appreciate all the color there.\nGreg Brown: Thank you Joseph.\nOperator: Next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Housum: Good afternoon guys and great results and impressive guide. Greg, as we look at your software and services margin sitting almost 37% this quarter. I guess the question is, is like, where can those margins go to and maybe some color on the incremental margins for every buck of business brought in? Can help us kind of clear the picture?\nGreg Brown: Well, we had previously said, Keith, thanks for the question that on the full year, we thought we could achieve comparable margins. We had great S&S performance in Q2 and we thought we could have for the full year, as we told you a quarter ago, comparable maybe slightly down, but I thought we were shooting for comparable operating margins in light of the required accounting treatment on Airwave and the decrement of $80 million starting August 1. That falls obviously to SNS and the requisite profitability that Jason articulated. So I\u2019ve now and we now expect S&S operating margins accounting for that deferral to be down on an operating margin year-over-year basis. In terms of next year, it\u2019s too early to, to guide for that. And we have to see ultimately what\u2019s decided with the Competition Appeal Tribunal appeal and what the disposition of Airwave is from a financial perspective. That said, we continue to make improvements on synergies and platforming S&S, maybe Mahesh could talk a little bit about that. We\u2019re doing some successful orchestration and integration to get the software sleeves more integrated and working a little bit more seamlessly and a little bit more efficiently. So there\u2019s opportunity, Keith, but it would be premature to quantify at this time.\nKeith Housum: All right, I appreciate that.\nMahesh Saptharishi: Across our platform\u2026\nKeith Housum: I\u2019m sorry, go ahead Mahesh.\nMahesh Saptharishi: So across our platforms whether that\u2019s cloud or on-prem we are exercising greater synergies in terms of core technology stack. We are optimizing some of our cloud delivery capabilities and really focusing a lot on ease of install as well, so all of that translates to hopefully a good game for us.\nKeith Housum: Got you. Thank you. And then coming back to the CMA ruling and the appeals process, I guess, Greg, what\u2019s the next steps, assuming that you guys lose on appeal? Can you provide perhaps a rough timeline about how this plays out here over the next year or two?\nGreg Brown: Well, in terms of the appeal, it would be our expectation that the CAT rules on the appeal by the end of Q3. I don\u2019t really want to get into hypotheticals on if this, then, that, but we have been consistent, Keith, that said, we will exercise all legal avenues available to us. So the next step after the CAT, if the CAT rules against us would be us taking to this to the UK Court of Appeals. And that would be after the CAT ruling. I don\u2019t know the timeline of what they would do. What happens there is they have to decide up or down whether they would actually hear the case. I don\u2019t know the timeline that they have available to them in terms of the window to decide. So this will go on a few more months and hopefully we can give you more clarity on the next earnings call.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Keith.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move next to Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Just a couple questions for me. First, obviously the backlog continues to grow. I guess, I just want to make sure is there anything that we should be mindful of a peak quarter for product just in terms of as the supply chain clears and less forward orders? Or is this just really a result of kind of strength of multi-year orders, maybe as the first question. And then as a second question, just traction on kind of bringing APX NEXT into the mid-market or just kind of adoption trends that you\u2019re seeing there? Thanks.\nGreg Brown: Our expectation for backlog and specifically product backlog is for it to remain strong through the duration of the year. That\u2019s a function of our expectations for continued strong inbound orders, as well as the amount of backlog that we can unlock with the available componentry that we need.\nJason Winkler: And related to APX NEXT, Meta, we are now \u2013 we had a very strong quarter of new orders. In terms of Q2, we received another $80 million now bringing it close to a half of $500 million in APX NEXT. And when I look at the complexion of those orders, it\u2019s not just big cities, but it\u2019s starting to hit into the Tier 2 cities as well. So we\u2019re really pleased with the performance of that product line.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nJason Winkler: Thanks, Meta.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is open.\nLouie DiPalma: Greg, Jason, Jack, Mahesh, and Tim, good afternoon.\nGreg Brown: Louie, how are you?\nLouie DiPalma: Doing excellent. Thank you. As it relates to the LMR device refresh last quarter you discussed how 80% of LMR radio orders were for your older APX radio, despite how APX NEXT has had the strongest demand of any new radio that you have ever introduced and how it was introduced way back in October 19. Why are so many customers still adopting the older APX platform and does this instill confidence that the upgrade cycle for APX NEXT will still potentially be in full effect even a decade from now?\nGreg Brown: So just a couple points. The first of which is think about the government\u2019s procurement cycle, which is one to say it\u2019s long cycle, it\u2019s long years. We did not announce the mid-tier APX NEXT until Q3, late Q3 of 2022. So Louie, what that\u2019s really a function of a byproduct of when it was announced, what was actually able to be quoted at that point in time. But without question, we\u2019re seeing acceleration to the numbers, $80 million in a quarter on the new orders, the type and the striation of customers that are buying those devices. So the other piece of it, just historically speaking, having worked here long enough to see probably three pretty large scale device refreshes, it typically takes three years \u2013 three to five years post-launch to start to alleviate and move those legacy versions down and through the cycle.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And it seems that The House committee has approved a $15 billion next-generation 911 funding bill. And on this topic, what is the status of the integration of Rave Wireless with your VESTA solution? And has the adoption of Rave accelerated as a result of the combination with Motorola? Have you juiced up Rave\u2019s ability to generate orders from the education vertical and enterprise vertical?\nMahesh Saptharishi: Absolutely. So we \u2013 as of last quarter, we are now bundling the Rave 911 suite along with our VESTA, new VESTA sales. So it comes part of that as a whole. In addition to that we have been actively working on just \u2013 Rave, remember, is an important bridge for us from enterprise security to public safety. And we\u2019re adding more and more lanes to that bridge with every integration that we do here. The VESTA integration is definitely one of those. I mentioned the panic button integration with aware being another one. We\u2019re integrating Rave into Orchestrate, which now ties that in with the video and access control pieces as well. So together Rave now plugs into public safety more effectively. And then Rave and aware together actually allows us to connect different instances of CAD as well. So dispatchers instances can communicate with each other as well. So as you look at the install base that we have in VESTA, as you look at the install base that we have in schools, K-12 schools with video and access control, we\u2019re leveraging all of that by bringing that together as this bridge between public safety and enterprise security gets wider.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. Thanks, Mahesh. And lastly for me, do you have any thoughts on the reported TETRA cybersecurity vulnerabilities?\nMahesh Saptharishi: Sure. So I think the first thing is Etsy is the primary spokesman in custodian for the TETRA standard in conjunction with the critical communications authority in Europe. What was reported, I think the first thing I\u2019d like to point out is what was reported is there was no weaknesses found in the public safety algorithms. There\u2019s three algorithms. Tier 1, TEA1 is actually for general use. It\u2019s a little bit more open due to export control issues. But there\u2019s been no exploitation of operational networks that we know of. And essentially subsequent to those findings, which we knew about even into late last year there\u2019s been software patches and then upgrades to the algorithms that have been done subsequent to that. So this was actually paid, this was a research tank done out of the Netherlands who actually did the testing. So yes, something we knew about we had a \u2013 the primary weakness was in general use, and I think it\u2019s been remediated since then.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. So it\u2019s been resolved already. Thanks.\nMahesh Saptharishi: Yes. In our view, yes. Thanks, Louie.\nLouie DiPalma: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, everybody. Thanks for joining us, but just in closing, I want to make sure I thank all the employees and the people in Motorola Solutions worldwide and all of our channel partners worldwide. I\u2019m proud of you and we\u2019re proud of you, most especially what you do, how you do it, and the execution. I said in the call, you heard from Jason and Mahesh and Jack, this business is performing as well as I\u2019ve ever seen it. Demand is strong. It\u2019s strong for what we do, public safety, enterprise security. And I like what we\u2019re doing to meet that demand and exceed that demand with the execution of what we do and what we\u2019re doing on the portfolio reinvention and device refresh. We talk a lot about APX NEXT and all the great work done there, but there\u2019s also great work being done on video security and access control that Mahesh is doing around 911 command center. And while we\u2019re doing that and running the business and lowering PPV costs and incrementally improving supply chain and engineering in real time doing product redesign, we\u2019re expanding gross margins, we\u2019re expanding operating margins. We have a record Q2 for orders. We end Q2 with record backlog. We talked about the duration of backlog being stronger. And Jack talked about the pipeline activity and the order velocity and conversion. It\u2019s excellent. And Jason talked about that we expect backlog to be strong for the balance of the remainder of the year. The last two things I\u2019d say is we referenced it a little bit, we just talked about Rave. I\u2019m really proud of the acquisitions we\u2019ve made, the integration work that\u2019s been done organizationally and strategically, but also technically. And those acquisitions are performing at or above what we expected. We have \u2013 I love the upgrade. We just got, we have a strong balance sheet. We continue to be disciplined in capital allocation, and I think we have an excellent opportunity in front of us. I appreciate you joining us, and we\u2019ll talk to you again in a few months. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the internet within three hours.

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 12% and was above our guidance with double-digit growth in both segments, both regions and in all three technologies. FX headwinds during the quarter were $23 million, while acquisitions added $20 million. GAAP operating earnings were $518 million or 21.6% of sales, up from 16.7% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $641 million, up 29% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%, up 350 basis points. The strong year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales, inclusive of our higher prices, pricing, lower direct material costs and improved operating leverage. GAAP earnings per share was $2.15 compared to $1.33 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.65, up 28% from $2.07 last year. This strong growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. OpEx in Q2 was $555 million, up $53 million versus last year, primarily due to increased expenses from acquisitions, investments in video and higher employee-related incentives in the current year. Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $93 million, up $83 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $40 million, up $89 million. The increase in year-over-year cash flow was primarily driven by higher earnings and improved working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes. For the full year, we continue to expect approximately $1.9 billion of operating cash flow. The linearity of our cash flow is expected to be consistent with last year with higher earnings and improved working capital driving increased cash flow in the second half. Also, as we previously highlighted, this year's cash flow includes approximately $300 million of additional cash taxes compared to last year, inclusive of a one-time $70 million tax payment that relates to an IP reorganization that we did in 2022. Capital allocation in Q2 included $224 million in share repurchases, $148 million in cash dividends and $53 million of CapEx. Moving to segment results. In the Products and SI segment, sales were up 12% versus last year, driven by improved supply availability in the current year and the benefit from pricing actions continuing to flow through. Currency headwinds were $10 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $2 million. Operating earnings were $285 million or 19.8% of sales, up from 14.6% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, lower material costs, inclusive of lower broker spend for semiconductors and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include $145 million P25 system upgrade for Kern County, California. A $41 million P25 system and device order for a U.S. federal customer, a $31 million P25 system expansion for Ventura County, California, a $19 million P25 device order for a U.S. federal customer and a $6 million fixed video order for a large U.S. healthcare customer. In Software and Services, revenue was up 13%, including 20% growth in Command Center and 19% growth in Video. Revenue from acquisitions was $18 million in the quarter, and FX headwinds were $13 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $356 million, up 15% versus last year and operating margins were 36.9%, up from 36.1% last year. On higher sales and improved operating leverage, partially offset by higher costs from acquisitions. Some notable Q2 highlights in this segment include a $34 million video order for the Virginia State Police, which included our largest in-car video order ever, a $15 million LMR services agreement with City of Baltimore, Maryland, a $13 million managed services agreement for LMR and a renewal in Latin America; a $12 million Command Center order for a U.S. federal customer and an $8 million LMR service agreement with another U.S. federal customer. Looking at regional results for the company, North America Q2 revenue was $1.6 billion, up 11% on strong growth in all three technologies. International Q2 revenue was $762 million, up 16% versus last year, driven by growth in LMR and Video, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog was a Q2 record of $14.3 billion, up 6% or $856 million versus last year, driven by strong demand in all three technologies. Sequentially, backlog was up $211 million, driven by record Q2 orders in both segments. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $496 million or 11% and year-over-year and up $100 million sequentially, driven primarily by strong LMR demand. In Software and Services, backlog was up $360 million compared to last year, driven by strong demand for multiyear software and services contracts in North America, partially offset by revenue recognition for Airwave and the adjustment related to the ESN contract exit. Sequentially, backlog was up $111 million, driven by record Q2 orders in the segment. Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 6% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.99 and $3.04 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. For the full year, we are again increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $9.875 billion to $9.9 billion, up from our prior range of $9.725 billion to $9.775 billion, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.40 and $11.48 per share up from our prior guidance of $11.21 to $11.29 per share. This full year outlook assumes $25 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. Before turning it back to Greg, I wanted to provide some color on a few financial topics. First, an update on the CMA and Airwave. As we've stated previously, we strongly disagree with the CMA's final decision. Earlier this week, the CMA issued its remedies order regarding implementation of their final decision effective on August 1. This procedural next step does not change our position regarding the ongoing appeal process and our strong belief in our case. However, from an accounting perspective, beginning August 1, we will now defer revenue for the amount above the remedies order price control until the appeals process has been completed. This deferral and resulting lower revenue from Airwave for the remainder of the year is fully incorporated into our increased revenue and earnings guidance for the year. Second, earlier this week, Moody's upgraded our credit from two Baa2 from Baa3. This higher credit rating underscores the strength of our balance sheet, including the strong liquidity position, our balanced debt maturity profile, significantly improved pension status, along with a track record of consistently growing earnings and cash flow. And finally, our increased guidance for the year highlights the strength of our business as we enter the second half. Our backlog is exceptionally strong, driven by robust customer demand. And based on our current pipeline and supply chain environment, we expect backlog to remain strong going forward. Additionally, the expected lower semiconductors we articulated in February, the cost related to these semiconductors coupled with the pricing adjustments in our own portfolio that were implemented in the second half of last year are driving the significant full year margin expansion of approximately 175 basis points. That is implied in our increased guidance. I'm now turning the call back to Greg. Thanks, Tim. So our expectations for Airwave revenues this year with the now deferred revenue effective August 1 are for about $480 million of revenue from Airwave. That'll be down from about $560 million last year. To answer your question on cost, we run that network and provide a service level. I wouldn't anticipate significant cost changes. Our cost to run that network and deliver the services are what they are. So we are deferring about $80 million in revenue this year and still raising our guidance from the last time we were together by about $140 million. Hi George, thanks for the question. So we began the year with an expectation for $50 million of lower costs related to premiums through brokers. We're trending a bit better than that. We're on path to about a $60 million year-over-year benefit largely in the first half. We're still spending some investments on brokers. As we look into next year, we would expect to comparable benefit level of about $60 million into 2024 for brokers. Again, the supply chain environment remains fluid. It's incrementally better, but we're still using the same tools we've been using for over a year to make sure that we get the supplies that we need. The level of commitment from our suppliers is strong but their lead times remain elevated still. And so from time to time we will use PPV [ph] to secure the parts to match the record demand that we're seeing. Yes. This year's envelope is going to be a little less than that. It's more important that we \u2013 as we look at next year's envelope reducing by $60 million, that's our current thinking. As we go through supply planning, there's other offsets that are always in the mix around direct materials costs, some positive, some unfavorable. So as we look to next year, we see a $60 million benefit, particularly related to this opportunity from broker fees. Yes. So first of all, the beginning date of the deferral for revenue is consistent with the remedies order, which is August 1 to the end of the year. That's the approximately $80 million. If you do the math on that for next year it would \u2013 it'd be approximately another $100 million step down. There are a variety of inputs that go into us servicing Airwave, the usage of the network, the one-time events that go with the network, the number of user communities that subscribe as well as inflation and other variables that go into how much revenue we recognize from the contract. All those things together last year $560 million, this year on path to $480 million and then you can do the math on the price control into next year for approximately another $100 million decline. For the full year, correct. Yes, so as I mentioned to Tim, the cost structure and our needs to run this network haven't changed. So the lower revenue largely tracks to a lower a margin amount as well. So it's important to note also in terms of the first half performance, and you're right, we had significant margin expansion in products. That's off of last year's first half, which included our highest broker costs as well as last year's first half didn't include our own pricing increases. So effective July 1 of last year in our second half, you saw significant on good growth, significant margin step up in the second half. That's continued through the first half of this year. And as we look to growth in our second half this year, we'll still have margin increases over those records from last year. And really that's a function of when we implemented the price increases and when the PPV or higher broker costs have come out of our product set. So business model change in low end PCR we mentioned in February, we've gone to a model where we only recognized the margin and the revenue in the product, no longer the COGS. So it's OE neutral, but did change the revenue line. That was a way to focus our business on higher value efforts. So that's something... Choice we did in February and it's working out quite well. The other thing I'd point you to is the lead times from our key semiconductor manufacturers and the commitments they give us for getting us the products and the semiconductors we need, support the increased guide and continue to represent opportunity for us as we go forward. But we get commitments from them and we plan the business and how much revenue we can unlock out of backlog based on that. And related to APX NEXT, Meta, we are now \u2013 we had a very strong quarter of new orders. In terms of Q2, we received another $80 million now bringing it close to a half of $500 million in APX NEXT. And when I look at the complexion of those orders, it's not just big cities, but it's starting to hit into the Tier 2 cities as well. So we're really pleased with the performance of that product line. Thanks, Meta."

            "name": "Mahesh Saptharishi",
            "content": "One more thing maybe to add to that is just from a safety reimagine standpoint, we're also integrating Rave along with Orchestrate and Rave. We now have integrations going into aware with a panic button. We also have the capacity to integrate weapons detection. We also launched weapons detection for the school's market. So all in all, we have other headwinds come \u2013 tailwinds coming with us there to push the whole story from a school security standpoint. Thanks, Ben. Across our platform... So across our platforms whether that's cloud or on-prem we are exercising greater synergies in terms of core technology stack. We are optimizing some of our cloud delivery capabilities and really focusing a lot on ease of install as well, so all of that translates to hopefully a good game for us. Absolutely. So we \u2013 as of last quarter, we are now bundling the Rave 911 suite along with our VESTA, new VESTA sales. So it comes part of that as a whole. In addition to that we have been actively working on just \u2013 Rave, remember, is an important bridge for us from enterprise security to public safety. And we're adding more and more lanes to that bridge with every integration that we do here. The VESTA integration is definitely one of those. I mentioned the panic button integration with aware being another one. We're integrating Rave into Orchestrate, which now ties that in with the video and access control pieces as well. So together Rave now plugs into public safety more effectively. And then Rave and aware together actually allows us to connect different instances of CAD as well. So dispatchers instances can communicate with each other as well. So as you look at the install base that we have in VESTA, as you look at the install base that we have in schools, K-12 schools with video and access control, we're leveraging all of that by bringing that together as this bridge between public safety and enterprise security gets wider. Sure. So I think the first thing is Etsy is the primary spokesman in custodian for the TETRA standard in conjunction with the critical communications authority in Europe. What was reported, I think the first thing I'd like to point out is what was reported is there was no weaknesses found in the public safety algorithms. There's three algorithms. Tier 1, TEA1 is actually for general use. It's a little bit more open due to export control issues. But there's been no exploitation of operational networks that we know of. And essentially subsequent to those findings, which we knew about even into late last year there's been software patches and then upgrades to the algorithms that have been done subsequent to that. So this was actually paid, this was a research tank done out of the Netherlands who actually did the testing. So yes, something we knew about we had a \u2013 the primary weakness was in general use, and I think it's been remediated since then. Yes. In our view, yes. Thanks, Louie."

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter with revenue and earnings per share both exceeding our guidance. In Software and Services, revenue was up 13% and operating earnings were up 15%, driven by strong growth across all three technologies. And in Products and Systems Integration, continued robust demand and improved supply chain availability led to a 12% growth in revenue and a 52% growth in operating earnings in the segment. Additionally, we ended the quarter with record Q2 ending backlog of $14.3 billion, up approximately $850 million versus last year, and also up approximately $200 million sequentially. Second, our exceptional performance during the quarter was broad-based, with double-digit revenue growth in both segments both regions and in all three technologies, including 20% growth in Command Center and 17% growth in Video Security. We also saw record Q2 orders in both segments during the quarter, driven by customers prioritizing technology investments to strengthen public safety and enterprise security. And finally, based on our Q2 results and the continued strong demand we're seeing across the business, we're again raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share. I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Jason, thank you very much. First, our exceptional Q2 results highlight the continued strong momentum we're seeing across the business. We grew revenue double-digits in both segments, both regions, and in all three technologies. We expanded operating margins by 350 basis points, and we achieved record Q2 orders, which has led to our highest ending backlog ever for a second quarter, and is driving our increased guidance for the full year. Second, we continue to leverage our global installed base to sell more value-add Software and Services to our customers. During the quarter, Software and Services revenue was up 13% with strong growth in all three technologies. We also achieved record Q2 orders in this segment, highlighted by our largest in-car video order ever from the Virginia State Police that included automated license plate recognition and digital evidence management. And with our recent Rave acquisition, we've made significant advances in integration across our ecosystem, which is driving strong pipeline demand for Rave together with our command center products. And finally, I just wanted to spend a little time and provide some color on artificial intelligence. We recognized AI and the potential impact it could have on our customers back a few years ago when we acquired Avigilon and its AI capabilities. And we've seen and continue to see this technology driving opportunity for both our business and our customers. AI along with generative AI plays an important role in our solutions to help keep communities safe from actively analyzing live video and alerting humans when something important happens to assisting a 911 call with our live translation solution to automatically redacting evidence, these advancements improve response times, which can help save lives while also enhancing privacy for those involved. AI will continue to enhance how our solutions help protect people, property, and places. With our ongoing investments and deep expertise, we're very well-positioned in this space, and we expect to see increased adoption of these technologies from public safety, enterprises, and private organizations alike for a more proactive approach to safety and security. I'll now turn the call back to Tim and we'll open it up for your questions. And to Jason's point, the $80 million reduction due to accounting and the required treatment of that from $560 million to $480 million is obviously all in the back half of the year starting August 1, running through the remainder of the year. As in terms of expenses and investment, we continue to invest in Airwave by the way, Tim just a few months ago the end users gave us feedback and network performance and reliability, which was as high as we've ever achieved on Airwave. So we're proud of that and we continue to maintain and invest on behalf of our end users. In terms of macro, high level the business is as good as I've ever seen it. The demand drivers are strong. Jack has talked about, and we'll talk a little bit about today if you want about device refresh. And interestingly, Tim, Molloy mentioned last year, we try to track demand against the orders achieved last year, and we believe as best we could tell less than 5% of our orders last year were tagged due to ARPA. Through the first half of this year, we also believe it's less than 5% as well. So the nice thing about this is, we're seeing demand drivers around public safety, video security, access control, command center, software and services that's really underpinning environmental and overall demand sure ARPA helps, but as best we could tell, it's fairly minimal. Thanks, Tim. And I do have to say thanks to for all the engineers in Motorola, because as we manage PPV and to Jason's point, we'll achieve now $60 million, a little higher than $50 million's target. And we \u2013 that would be our goal for next year as well another $60 million. A lot of the engineers in Motorola have done real time under Molloy's leadership and Scott Mottonen and others. They've done product redesign in a way that's allowed us to substitute parts in a matter of months that also have allowed the company to be adept and firm and responsive to our customers. And I just want everybody to know on the engineering community how grateful we are for that because they were \u2013 they've been superstars. Thanks, George. And Adam, what I'd say is like I think this process is proceeding as expected. So we knew that the CMA issued a final decision. In Q2, we knew it would be followed by a remedies order statutorily, they could have gone till October to do that as late as October. They did it now in light of the remedies implementation order, that requires the accounting treatment Jason just described. It doesn't change at all our belief and our confidence in this case, by the way. The hearing, the appeal to the competition appeals tribunal was yesterday and today. So that part is done as well. Now we will wait to see what they rule on the appeal. We have said and I've said we've been very consistent. We think this action is unprecedented overreaching. It effectively is opening up an already agreed on binding legal contract. But we'll see how it plays out, in the meantime, we've deferred the revenue through the end of this year as required and to articulate and quantify what it could be. If nothing else changed, it would be another approximately $100 million deferral or reduction of Airwave on a full year basis next year. First of all, I'd say that, and again, I compliment the team, Jason, Jack, on the improved gross margins, both on cost of goods as well as \u2013 as you know, we've taken a series of pricing actions starting last year and coming into this year. We view those pricing actions as sticky, not transient. So the margin profiles better. In terms of growth of LMR and the technology, we've guided for the full year mid-single-digits, we still expect that to be appropriate full year guidance. We're coming off some monster comps in the first half of this year. And by the way, the Airwave accounting treatment of the $80 million reduction or deferral in revenue is in the back half of this year, that would be reflected in the LMR technology. Having said that, I'm super proud of the gross margin expansion and operating margin expansion and while obviously we're sitting in August, so it's too early to talk about 2024, but it would be my and our expectations to grow operating margins in 2024 as well. Thanks, Adam. Well, I like number one to your point, Ben, thanks for the question. The underlying demand drivers of the business are strong absent funding. Then you get the funding and I talked about the, as best we can tell, the percentage orders in terms of order volume attributed to ARPA is 5% or less. The other thing I like is the multi-year nature of state and local funding, which is $350 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act and $170 billion of education, which is an absolutely prioritized vertical for us and what Jack Molloy and his team are doing. So we're not going to guide on 2024, but the fact that we had the print we had and record Q2 orders and record Q2 ending backlog and improved 12-month duration of backlog. And the other thing Molloy and I track is pipeline, right? So what's the pipeline and funnel? What's the stuff coming in at the top? How are we doing on order conversion and velocity? And when Jack and I look at that, that's favorable as well. And in terms of the health of the overall state and local budgets, they remain strong too. Good point, Mahesh. Yes. Joseph, just \u2013 I'm sure Jason will jump in as well, but I remind you that, you're right. Normally, this business is typically Q3 and Q4 weighted and seasonally dense. I think that's unchanged. But remember, we're guiding an increase in top and bottom, even with the $80 million of Airwave deferral in the back half and another $50 million of PCR light business model change. Jason can elaborate on that. So that's $130 million of revenue growth that needs to be incorporated into the second half guide, but still informs and allows us to raise. And on the bottom EPS line we have an incremental $0.30 tax headwind, $0.50 for the year. We had $0.20 headwind, first half $0.30 of EPS structural tax headwind back half. So as you incorporate those ingredients into the blender, it shouldn't take away or distract at all that the demand is strong, the raise is strong and the momentum is strong. And the choice, we... Thank you Joseph. Well, we had previously said, Keith, thanks for the question that on the full year, we thought we could achieve comparable margins. We had great S&S performance in Q2 and we thought we could have for the full year, as we told you a quarter ago, comparable maybe slightly down, but I thought we were shooting for comparable operating margins in light of the required accounting treatment on Airwave and the decrement of $80 million starting August 1. That falls obviously to SNS and the requisite profitability that Jason articulated. So I've now and we now expect S&S operating margins accounting for that deferral to be down on an operating margin year-over-year basis. In terms of next year, it's too early to, to guide for that. And we have to see ultimately what's decided with the Competition Appeal Tribunal appeal and what the disposition of Airwave is from a financial perspective. That said, we continue to make improvements on synergies and platforming S&S, maybe Mahesh could talk a little bit about that. We're doing some successful orchestration and integration to get the software sleeves more integrated and working a little bit more seamlessly and a little bit more efficiently. So there's opportunity, Keith, but it would be premature to quantify at this time. Well, in terms of the appeal, it would be our expectation that the CAT rules on the appeal by the end of Q3. I don't really want to get into hypotheticals on if this, then, that, but we have been consistent, Keith, that said, we will exercise all legal avenues available to us. So the next step after the CAT, if the CAT rules against us would be us taking to this to the UK Court of Appeals. And that would be after the CAT ruling. I don't know the timeline of what they would do. What happens there is they have to decide up or down whether they would actually hear the case. I don't know the timeline that they have available to them in terms of the window to decide. So this will go on a few more months and hopefully we can give you more clarity on the next earnings call. Thanks, Keith. Our expectation for backlog and specifically product backlog is for it to remain strong through the duration of the year. That's a function of our expectations for continued strong inbound orders, as well as the amount of backlog that we can unlock with the available componentry that we need. Louie, how are you? So just a couple points. The first of which is think about the government's procurement cycle, which is one to say it's long cycle, it's long years. We did not announce the mid-tier APX NEXT until Q3, late Q3 of 2022. So Louie, what that's really a function of a byproduct of when it was announced, what was actually able to be quoted at that point in time. But without question, we're seeing acceleration to the numbers, $80 million in a quarter on the new orders, the type and the striation of customers that are buying those devices. So the other piece of it, just historically speaking, having worked here long enough to see probably three pretty large scale device refreshes, it typically takes three years \u2013 three to five years post-launch to start to alleviate and move those legacy versions down and through the cycle. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for joining us, but just in closing, I want to make sure I thank all the employees and the people in Motorola Solutions worldwide and all of our channel partners worldwide. I'm proud of you and we're proud of you, most especially what you do, how you do it, and the execution. I said in the call, you heard from Jason and Mahesh and Jack, this business is performing as well as I've ever seen it. Demand is strong. It's strong for what we do, public safety, enterprise security. And I like what we're doing to meet that demand and exceed that demand with the execution of what we do and what we're doing on the portfolio reinvention and device refresh. We talk a lot about APX NEXT and all the great work done there, but there's also great work being done on video security and access control that Mahesh is doing around 911 command center. And while we're doing that and running the business and lowering PPV costs and incrementally improving supply chain and engineering in real time doing product redesign, we're expanding gross margins, we're expanding operating margins. We have a record Q2 for orders. We end Q2 with record backlog. We talked about the duration of backlog being stronger. And Jack talked about the pipeline activity and the order velocity and conversion. It's excellent. And Jason talked about that we expect backlog to be strong for the balance of the remainder of the year. The last two things I'd say is we referenced it a little bit, we just talked about Rave. I'm really proud of the acquisitions we've made, the integration work that's been done organizationally and strategically, but also technically. And those acquisitions are performing at or above what we expected. We have \u2013 I love the upgrade. We just got, we have a strong balance sheet. We continue to be disciplined in capital allocation, and I think we have an excellent opportunity in front of us. I appreciate you joining us, and we'll talk to you again in a few months. Thank you."

            "content": "I'd agree with that, Greg. The only thing I'd add to that, and I think you highlighted the benefits from a product standpoint, but from S&S standpoint, a year-over-year, we had a $360 million increase in backlog. In addition to that, we're in receipt of a contract from the State of Illinois for a $300 million frame agreement for a 10-year period for services. That's incremental and that's not reflected in our backlog, Tim. So I think that's just another proof point to the conversations we're having with customers really resonate for their needs right now. Thank you, Greg. And I think what I would say there is when we think about top of the pipeline being quoting, bottom of the pipeline being orders, and then the most important metric is the velocity between those two. The our velocity remains consistent. In fact, it's improved and we've seen a growing number of quoting. So I think that portends well to 2024. The other thing that I think is lost in a lot of people when we think about government funding, we've talked about ARPA. But when you think about personal income tax, corporate income tax and sales tax, those three funding streams have all been the beneficiary for government from inflation. So inflation for them means they get more tax receipts in. And their costs haven't necessarily gone in parallel. And I think a lot of people don't necessarily understand that, but I just wanted to mention that. So all things in, I think the funding environment and government remains very strong. So, well, K-12 is \u2013 there's really two technologies. It's video security and access control. And depending on the type of school district, we've seen an acceleration into our Alta, Avigilon Alta, which is cloud, but we've also got larger school districts that continue to buy Unity. But the K-12 education in general, we put the marker in that our video business is growing 15% K-12 and the EDU market is, is surpassing that growth level. It did last year, and it continues to grow through the first half of this year very robustly. And I think some of that's the beneficiary of ARPA funding, but I think a lot of it is really much more \u2013 it's much more secular around school security and that it's getting prioritized over everything else."

In addition, a webcast replay of this call will be available on our website within 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. The website address is www.motorolasolutionscom/investor. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference.\nTim Yocum: Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2023 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A. We have posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we referenced non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today\u2019s earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K or any quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And with that, I will turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thank you everybody for joining us today. First, let me start by just saying that Q1 was an exceptional start to the year. We achieved revenue and earnings per share above our guidance with revenue up 15% and earnings per share up 31% versus the prior year. We expanded operating margins by 470 basis points, and we had record Q1 orders, which led to record Q1 ending backlog of $14.1 billion, up 5% versus last year, inclusive of $372 million of unfavorable FX. Second, our outstanding Q1 performance was broad-based, with strong double-digit revenue growth in both segments, all three technologies and in both regions North America and international. Additionally, public safety and enterprise security remains more important than ever, which is driving demand for both our public safety and enterprise customers. And finally, based on our strong start to the year and continued robust demand, we\u2019re raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jason to take you through results and outlook and then be back and return for some final thoughts.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 15% and was above our guidance with double-digit growth in both segments, both regions and in all three technologies. FX headwinds during the quarter were $45 million, while acquisitions added $42 million. GAAP operating earnings were $399 million or 18.4% of sales, up from 12.6% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $532 million, up 42% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 24.5%, up 470 basis points. This strong year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales, lower direct material costs, inclusive of lower broker spend in attaining semiconductors and improved operating leverage. GAAP earnings per share was $1.61 compared to $1.54 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was $2.22, up 31% from $1.70 last year. The strong growth in earnings per share was driven by higher sales and margins, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. OpEx in Q1 was $530 million, up $38 million versus last year, primarily due to acquisitions and higher incentives in the current year. Turning to cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow was a usage of $8 million and free cash flow was a usage of $62 million. The cash flow in Q1 was in line with our expectations and included a onetime cash tax payment of $70 million related to an IP reorganization we completed last year. It also reflects our strategic decision to carry higher inventories. For the full year, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.9 billion, with greater contributions in the second half, consistent with the shape of last year\u2019s cash flow. The capital allocation for Q1 included $148 million in cash dividends, $140 million in share repurchases and $54 million of CapEx. Moving to our segment results, in the Products and SI segment, sales were up 18% versus last year, driven by improved supply availability in the current year and the benefit from pricing actions flowing through. Currency headwinds were $19 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter added $12 million. Operating earnings were $246 million or 18.9% of sales, up from 8.7% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, lower material costs, inclusive of lower broker spend and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q1\u2019s achievements in this segment include a $27 million countywide P25 system for Johnson County, Missouri, a $20 million P25 device order for a U.S. state and local customer, a $17 million P25 system for Wakulla County, Florida, a $16 million fixed video contract for a large health care system and a $15 million Apex and Apex Next devices order for the Kansas Highway Patrol. In Software and Services, revenue was up 10%, including 19% growth in Command Center and 20% growth in video. Revenue from acquisitions was $30 million in the quarter, and FX headwinds were $26 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $286 million, up 3% versus last year and operating margins were 32.9%, down from 35.2% last year on mix, higher costs from acquisitions and FX. For the full year, we expect operating margins in this segment to be comparable to last year to slightly down, driven by higher costs from acquisitions, primarily rate. Some notable Q1 highlights in this segment include a $340 million federal IDIQ award to combine existing services and provide new LMR services to the U.S. Air Force, which has long been an important customer of ours. Given the nature of this 10-year agreement, we recorded only $11 million of backlog in the first quarter and expect backlog to be recorded ratably over time for the remainder of the contract. Additionally, we expect new services included it to contribute an incremental $60 million of revenue over the 10-year period when compared to the previous service agreements. We also received a $21 million multiyear support services extension for Portugal\u2019s nationwide Catcher system, a $10 million LMR services agreement with a federal agency and a $9 million fixed video services contract renewal with the City of Chicago. Looking at regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.5 billion, up 14% on strong growth in all three technologies. International Q1 revenue was $679 million, up 16% versus last year with growth in all three technologies, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $14.1 billion, up 5% or $623 million versus last year, inclusive of $372 million of unfavorable FX. These results were driven by strong demand across all three technologies. Sequentially, backlog was down $280 million, driven primarily by typical order seasonality in North America. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $601 million or 15% driven primarily by strong LMR demand. Sequentially, backlog was down $186 million due to North America orders seasonality following a record backlog in Q4. In Software and Services, backlog was up $22 million compared to last year, driven by strong demand for multiyear software and services contracts in North America, partially offset by the revenue recognition for Airwave along with $329 million of unfavorable FX and the adjustment related to the exit of ESN contract that we announced last year. Sequentially, backlog was down $94 million, driven primarily by revenue recognition for Airwave. Turning now to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up 10% to 11% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.49 and $2.54 per share. This assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. For the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $9.725 billion to $9.775 billion, up from our prior range of $9.65 billion to $9.7 billion and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.21 and $11.29, up from our prior guidance of $11.10 and $11.22 per share. This full year outlook assumes $25 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. As I mentioned on the last call, the increase from our 20.1% tax rate last year is due to lower tax benefits on share comp and a higher UK tax rate in the current year, both of which combined represent an approximately $0.50 headwind in our full year earnings per share guide. The increased outlook for the full year is a reflection of the continued strength of our business and demand for our solutions. The revenue guidance reflects expectations for strong double-digit growth in the first half as well as continued growth in the second half of the year, which comes on top of the 15% growth we saw in the second half of last year. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Jason. Let me just end with a few thoughts. First and foremost, our business remains very strong. We had record Q1 orders and achieved revenue above our expectations. We expanded operating margins by 470 basis points. We ended the quarter with our highest Q1 ending backlog ever, and our public safety and enterprise customers are continuing to prioritize our solutions to help communities safe, which is driving our increased top and bottom line guidance for the full year. Second, I want to highlight two recent announcements in our Video Security business. First, we made the decision to integrate our end-to-end fixed video portfolio, consolidating the majority of our fixed video solutions under two platforms: Avigilon Alta and Avigilon Unity. Alta is our cloud-native security suite, consolidating Openpath, and Ava Security, while Unity is our on-prem security suite, consolidating Avigilon and Indigo vision. This help streamline our go-to-market channels and further reinforces our vertical focus, particularly in government, but also education and healthcare, which combine those three now represent half of our video security revenues. Additionally, in our mobile video business, we launched our new V700-body-worn camera. The V700 is our first body-worn camera to provide broadband connectivity that facilitates integration with our market-leading in-car video solution, our Apex radios and our command center software, including live video streaming and location tracking through our aware product. And finally, our strong start to the year underlines the strength and resiliency of our business. The demand for our products and solutions that keep communities safe remains exceptionally strong. Our continued focus on cost management and inventory optimization, coupled with our previous modest pricing actions that we took earlier continues to drive margin expansion and our strong balance sheet and durable cash flows allow us to be opportunistic with the deployment of capital going forward to create long-term shareholder value. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tim and open it up for your questions.\nTim Yocum: Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Thank you. Yes, two, if I could here. First, just looking at the second half, I know, Jason, you mentioned tough comps, but hoping you could just give a little commentary around moving parts given those pricing benefits and pretty healthy backlog still. So what are the moving parts in that second half? And then second, more specifically on video, Greg or Jack, if you could talk a little bit about, it was good to see above the full year growth rate in Q1. Could you talk a little bit about where we are with cross-sell opportunities and also opportunities in video from NDAA and RPS safe schools and things like that? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Sure, Tim. So on the second half, so you\u2019ll recall that last year in the second half is when the pricing actions that we implemented really began to show up in the P&L, and those really helped last year\u2019s growth and profitability expansion in the second half. So our position today, as we look at those 15% comps is that we\u2019re still in a supply-constrained environment. We have lead times from our suppliers. We have expectations to grow and with opportunities ahead of us for the second half with the continued demand that we have. Where the pricing actions benefited us particularly in Q1 and expect similar for Q2 is last year\u2019s comps in the first half did not include those same pricing actions. So as we start to enter July, we\u2019re anniversary-ing those pricing actions and still expect growth on top of those.\nJack Molloy: And Tim, specific to cross-sell, what I would do is highlight four specific verticals, starting with government. As we have attested to before, Government was a nascent business when we acquired Avigilon, we made subsequent acquisitions. But just to put it in context, we\u2019ve kind of put the marker out there this year for a video security business that we would grow approximately 15%. We expect government to grow in the high teens. And we think we\u2019ve got opportunities to move that. Specifically, I\u2019d also call out healthcare, we\u2019re really, really pleased. We won \u2013 we secured a $16 million deal with the large-scale hospital system. This was an add-on. And the beauty of that is they\u2019re not only a video user, but they\u2019re also a radio user. Education has been we\u2019ve attested to the fact that numerous school systems are upgrading. Some are going with Avigilon Unity on prime systems, large-scale urban schools. But what we\u2019re really seeing is acceleration of growth in the cloud there and the ability to do radio alert and integrate access control, LMR, our command center software product called Compass into school systems is a game changer. And then lastly is the industrial space, namely utilities. We\u2019ve talked about the fact we\u2019ve secured a large-scale utility in the past. We\u2019ve done in the area of $50 million of utility. And I think as utilities start to fortify their power grids and their substations will have incremental cross-sell opportunities there, Tim. But I think the highlight is we tie it all into making sure that we incent our sales force to go and cross-sell, and that\u2019s just part of the DNA now.\nTim Long: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess I think you guys mentioned ARPA in the last question or maybe Tim did, but what are your expectations for the ARPA benefit this year? I know that you\u2019ve got about $400 million in orders from ARPA related projects last year, I would imagine some of that converted to revenue last year. But what do you think that might look like for 2023? Any sense? Thanks.\nJack Molloy: Yes. So George, I would say ARPA, anytime there\u2019s federal stimulus dollars are conducive, and I would say, beneficial to the business. But to kind of put it in context, it\u2019s approximately 5% of our orders in North America last year. And that\u2019s not to diminish it, but I would take it to a higher level. I\u2019ve actually gone and looked in Salesforce. It\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019ve contributed to deals that were secured, but they for the sole purpose of deals that were secured. I think at the end of the day, when you think about mission-critical communications or even a school, we think we\u2019re in an area of prioritization in areas as we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s a need to have, not a nice to have. So I think it\u2019s generally conducive, but it\u2019s \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it\u2019s the largest attributor to our success.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. Great. And then just as a quick follow-on. I think the question everyone\u2019s been asking is on supply chain, many companies, I think, are going through inventory corrections now. I mean any sense that your customers have been inventoring products or is there any risk of supply chain corrections or inventory corrections for you guys as you look forward? Thanks.\nGreg Brown: The demand from our customers remains very strong. Our backlog position is at a record level. And that includes backlog that customers are having to wait a bit longer than they\u2019d like and we\u2019re working through those delays in getting them products. With the results in Q1, we were able to attain a little bit better supply. We had a good quarter across LMR, Public Safety, had a good quarter with PCR. So we\u2019re getting after this backlog position and fulfilling the customers demands, both the demand they placed on us in backlog is also the demand they place on us within the quarter. So \u2013 and our inventory position, if I shift to our balance sheet, has helped us mitigate a choppy supply environment, and we continue to be mindful of inventory and its utility in serving what remains a challenging supply environment. It\u2019s been a helpful tool. And we do have expectations for inventory to reduce in the second half. That\u2019s in our cash flow expectations, but it remains an important tool to navigate this environment.\nGeorge Notter: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. And maybe just a question on the APX NEXT, you had mentioned that being targeted towards the high end and then introducing kind of the mid-tier product. I just wanted to get a sense of adoption trends of the various pieces of the portfolio and were they kind of following the customer adoption types that you expected? And then just maybe an update on Rave integration would be helpful. Thanks.\nJack Molloy: Sure, Meta. Maybe I will start with the APX NEXT, and Mahesh will speak to Rave. First of all, we are in the early innings, as we have said before. And I think it\u2019s most important to point out that it\u2019s a multiyear introduction for the APX NEXT. What typically happens is we have \u2013 we run the APX original and the APX NEXT line in tandem for the foreseeable future. In fact, to point that out 80% in Q1 of our device revenue was actually APX original. So, we have got a coexist and strong pipeline for both of them. We have got $410 million orders since we introduced the APX NEXT. But we have just recently, last fall, introduced the N-Series radio, which starts to fill in the portfolio and now we are bringing out international P25 units to bear that will be targeted in Australia, New Zealand and Israel. All-in, with the new product, what we are seeing is kind of high-single digit ASP increases as well.\nMahesh Saptharishi: And I would also mention other parts of the portfolio, TETRA, PCR are areas where we have focused and have exciting products coming to market and receptive customers to those as well. So, we are at an important point in the targeted investments we made in and through COVID that are now producing those exciting products are also an important part of our growth drivers.\nGreg Brown: And on Rave, Rave has exceeded our initial expectations for performance. We see strong traction in education, especially higher ed, but also K-12. And as we previously talked about, Rave bridges enterprise security with public safety and with some of the initiatives that we have undertaken recently, we are making the bridge wider effectively allowing for more data and at a faster rate to go from enterprise security to public safety. So, two specific examples worth mentioning there, first, with every one of our new VESTA 911 orders, we are actually bundling Rave 911 suite. And what that includes is two-way texting, caller profile. This is information about individuals who perhaps need special assistance, facility info, which is blueprints a facility so that responders can respond with greater information as to what to see \u2013 what they will see when they get to the facility and very importantly, caller location. And that is going to be part of our Rave VESTA 911 offer going forward. The second is we are integrating more closely with our enterprise security solution. So, Orchestrate is a key enabler for that. And as part of our full Safety Reimagined program, we are bringing Rave much closer in terms of the ability to detect and the ability to alert using Rave alert and the ability to bridge into 911 as appropriate. So, those two together is really augmenting our path forward in terms of taking advantage of our strength in education, along with our presence with PSAPs.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nSami Badri: Alright. Thank you. I had a couple of questions, some of the modeling, some of the business dynamics. I will start with business dynamics first. So, one on the backlog, so there obviously are a lot of big deals. And maybe you could give us a characterization of how many of these bigger deals are expected? And then maybe taking that question a step further is if we excluded FX impact and excluded big episodic activity, are you still seeing the backlog step up, right, with more of these \u2013 your standard business motion? And then I have a follow-up.\nJack Molloy: Sami, I think I would address your inquiry. We have seen strong demand not only big deals, but also the usual type and profile of our business. And I would point to duration. While our backlog is up and at record levels, the duration of our backlog is similar to slightly better than it was last year and it was last quarter. So, not only are we growing backlog, the opportunities we have to convert that backlog within the year are slightly better. So, that\u2019s one of the reasons that, again, with our expectations going up for the year, it\u2019s driven by that backlog position.\nGreg Brown: And backlog is up in the unfavorable FX to your other point of $370 million. By the way, the other thing, Sami, is even when we have a large product, much like the Air Force we talked about earlier on the call, it\u2019s a $340 million 10-year order, only $11 million of that is logged in backlog. So, I like the composition and the duration of the backlog in addition to it being absolute and at record levels as we exit Q1.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you for that. Also, Greg, Jason, if you guys could give us any kind of idea on all video revenue growth targets for 2023. And also, we appreciate the new breakout of the Avigilon segment.\nJason Winkler: So, our expectations for total video remain approximately 15%. That\u2019s consistent with our last call. And as Jack mentioned, that growth will be even better in some of our power verticals, which represent over half of the composition of the revenue. So, video is performing to our expectations. And then Sami, to your observation of Greg\u2019s comments around our portfolio around Alta and Unity, that\u2019s a market-facing change that we will represent the brands and Jack\u2019s sales team is positioned to sell video. We are in a great position to sell it either in an on-prem version, which is the way most customers buy today, but also in a cloud version. And as markets move, we are positioned extremely well.\nJack Molloy: Yes. I think a great example. I got a phone call yesterday, Sami, on that specific to a large-scale metropolitan school district. They had three finalists, two of the finalists were Avigilon Alta and Avigilon Unity. And I think that\u2019s the power that we can meet a customer for their specific needs that no one else in the marketplace has today.\nSami Badri: Great. Thank you very much.\nJack Molloy: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any additional comments or closing remarks.\nGreg Brown: Sure. Thank you. Look, I would just say in closing, it was a great Q1, and I think it highlights the fact that what we do has never been more important. Both the demand environment and execution is strong. I am really proud of the people. I am really proud of our channel partners that achieved record Q1 orders, record Q1 backlog. Look, at the end of the day, as we exit Q1, I like our position. More importantly, I like our momentum. And then, again, this is despite the ongoing supply chain challenges that still have to sort of sell-through for the next several quarters. The fact is the intersection, as Mahesh talked about, of public safety and enterprise security, it\u2019s critical. And we are building a safety and security technology ecosystem that connects public safety with private institutions, as you heard Jack reference in those key verticals. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of this team. And I am optimistic and enthusiastic about the opportunity in front of us. I appreciate you joining, and I look forward to connecting up with you a quarter from now.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the Internet within two hours. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 15% and was above our guidance with double-digit growth in both segments, both regions and in all three technologies. FX headwinds during the quarter were $45 million, while acquisitions added $42 million. GAAP operating earnings were $399 million or 18.4% of sales, up from 12.6% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $532 million, up 42% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 24.5%, up 470 basis points. This strong year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales, lower direct material costs, inclusive of lower broker spend in attaining semiconductors and improved operating leverage. GAAP earnings per share was $1.61 compared to $1.54 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was $2.22, up 31% from $1.70 last year. The strong growth in earnings per share was driven by higher sales and margins, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year. OpEx in Q1 was $530 million, up $38 million versus last year, primarily due to acquisitions and higher incentives in the current year. Turning to cash flow.

Currency headwinds were $19 million and revenue from acquisitions in the quarter added $12 million. Operating earnings were $246 million or 18.9% of sales, up from 8.7% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, lower material costs, inclusive of lower broker spend and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q1's achievements in this segment include a $27 million countywide P25 system for Johnson County, Missouri, a $20 million P25 device order for a U.S. state and local customer, a $17 million P25 system for Wakulla County, Florida, a $16 million fixed video contract for a large health care system and a $15 million Apex and Apex Next devices order for the Kansas Highway Patrol. In Software and Services, revenue was up 10%, including 19% growth in Command Center and 20% growth in video. Revenue from acquisitions was $30 million in the quarter, and FX headwinds were $26 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $286 million, up 3% versus last year and operating margins were 32.9%, down from 35.2% last year on mix, higher costs from acquisitions and FX.

Some notable Q1 highlights in this segment include a $340 million federal IDIQ award to combine existing services and provide new LMR services to the U.S. Air Force, which has long been an important customer of ours. Given the nature of this 10-year agreement, we recorded only $11 million of backlog in the first quarter and expect backlog to be recorded ratably over time for the remainder of the contract. Additionally, we expect new services included it to contribute an incremental $60 million of revenue over the 10-year period when compared to the previous service agreements. We also received a $21 million multiyear support services extension for Portugal's nationwide Catcher system, a $10 million LMR services agreement with a federal agency and a $9 million fixed video services contract renewal with the City of Chicago. Looking at regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.5 billion, up 14% on strong growth in all three technologies. International Q1 revenue was $679 million, up 16% versus last year with growth in all three technologies, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a Q1 record of $14.1 billion, up 5% or $623 million versus last year, inclusive of $372 million of unfavorable FX. These results were driven by strong demand across all three technologies. Sequentially, backlog was down $280 million, driven primarily by typical order seasonality in North America. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was up $601 million or 15% driven primarily by strong LMR demand. Sequentially, backlog was down $186 million due to North America orders seasonality following a record backlog in Q4. In Software and Services, backlog was up $22 million compared to last year, driven by strong demand for multiyear software and services contracts in North America, partially offset by the revenue recognition for Airwave along with $329 million of unfavorable FX and the adjustment related to the exit of ESN contract that we announced last year. Sequentially, backlog was down $94 million, driven primarily by revenue recognition for Airwave. Turning now to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up 10% to 11% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.49 and $2.54 per share. This assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 173 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. For the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect revenue in the range of $9.725 billion to $9.775 billion, up from our prior range of $9.65 billion to $9.7 billion and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $11.21 and $11.29, up from our prior guidance of $11.10 and $11.22 per share. This full year outlook assumes $25 million of FX headwinds, a weighted average share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. As I mentioned on the last call, the increase from our 20.1% tax rate last year is due to lower tax benefits on share comp and a higher UK tax rate in the current year, both of which combined represent an approximately $0.50 headwind in our full year earnings per share guide. The increased outlook for the full year is a reflection of the continued strength of our business and demand for our solutions. The revenue guidance reflects expectations for strong double-digit growth in the first half as well as continued growth in the second half of the year, which comes on top of the 15% growth we saw in the second half of last year. I'll now turn the call back to Greg. So, our expectations for total video remain approximately 15%. That's consistent with our last call. And as Jack mentioned, that growth will be even better in some of our power verticals, which represent over half of the composition of the revenue. So, video is performing to our expectations. And then Sami, to your observation of Greg's comments around our portfolio around Alta and Unity, that's a market-facing change that we will represent the brands and Jack's sales team is positioned to sell video. We are in a great position to sell it either in an on-prem version, which is the way most customers buy today, but also in a cloud version. And as markets move, we are positioned extremely well."

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thank you everybody for joining us today. First, let me start by just saying that Q1 was an exceptional start to the year. We achieved revenue and earnings per share above our guidance with revenue up 15% and earnings per share up 31% versus the prior year. We expanded operating margins by 470 basis points, and we had record Q1 orders, which led to record Q1 ending backlog of $14.1 billion, up 5% versus last year, inclusive of $372 million of unfavorable FX. Second, our outstanding Q1 performance was broad-based, with strong double-digit revenue growth in both segments, all three technologies and in both regions North America and international. Additionally, public safety and enterprise security remains more important than ever, which is driving demand for both our public safety and enterprise customers. And finally, based on our strong start to the year and continued robust demand, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year. I'll turn the call over to Jason to take you through results and outlook and then be back and return for some final thoughts. Thanks, Jason. Let me just end with a few thoughts. First and foremost, our business remains very strong. We had record Q1 orders and achieved revenue above our expectations. We expanded operating margins by 470 basis points. We ended the quarter with our highest Q1 ending backlog ever, and our public safety and enterprise customers are continuing to prioritize our solutions to help communities safe, which is driving our increased top and bottom line guidance for the full year. Second, I want to highlight two recent announcements in our Video Security business. First, we made the decision to integrate our end-to-end fixed video portfolio, consolidating the majority of our fixed video solutions under two platforms: Avigilon Alta and Avigilon Unity. Alta is our cloud-native security suite, consolidating Openpath, and Ava Security, while Unity is our on-prem security suite, consolidating Avigilon and Indigo vision. This help streamline our go-to-market channels and further reinforces our vertical focus, particularly in government, but also education and healthcare, which combine those three now represent half of our video security revenues. Additionally, in our mobile video business, we launched our new V700-body-worn camera. The V700 is our first body-worn camera to provide broadband connectivity that facilitates integration with our market-leading in-car video solution, our Apex radios and our command center software, including live video streaming and location tracking through our aware product. And finally, our strong start to the year underlines the strength and resiliency of our business. The demand for our products and solutions that keep communities safe remains exceptionally strong. Our continued focus on cost management and inventory optimization, coupled with our previous modest pricing actions that we took earlier continues to drive margin expansion and our strong balance sheet and durable cash flows allow us to be opportunistic with the deployment of capital going forward to create long-term shareholder value. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Tim and open it up for your questions. Sure, Tim. So on the second half, so you'll recall that last year in the second half is when the pricing actions that we implemented really began to show up in the P&L, and those really helped last year's growth and profitability expansion in the second half. So our position today, as we look at those 15% comps is that we're still in a supply-constrained environment. We have lead times from our suppliers. We have expectations to grow and with opportunities ahead of us for the second half with the continued demand that we have. Where the pricing actions benefited us particularly in Q1 and expect similar for Q2 is last year's comps in the first half did not include those same pricing actions. So as we start to enter July, we're anniversary-ing those pricing actions and still expect growth on top of those. The demand from our customers remains very strong. Our backlog position is at a record level. And that includes backlog that customers are having to wait a bit longer than they'd like and we're working through those delays in getting them products. With the results in Q1, we were able to attain a little bit better supply. We had a good quarter across LMR, Public Safety, had a good quarter with PCR. So we're getting after this backlog position and fulfilling the customers demands, both the demand they placed on us in backlog is also the demand they place on us within the quarter. So \u2013 and our inventory position, if I shift to our balance sheet, has helped us mitigate a choppy supply environment, and we continue to be mindful of inventory and its utility in serving what remains a challenging supply environment. It's been a helpful tool. And we do have expectations for inventory to reduce in the second half. That's in our cash flow expectations, but it remains an important tool to navigate this environment. And on Rave, Rave has exceeded our initial expectations for performance. We see strong traction in education, especially higher ed, but also K-12. And as we previously talked about, Rave bridges enterprise security with public safety and with some of the initiatives that we have undertaken recently, we are making the bridge wider effectively allowing for more data and at a faster rate to go from enterprise security to public safety. So, two specific examples worth mentioning there, first, with every one of our new VESTA 911 orders, we are actually bundling Rave 911 suite. And what that includes is two-way texting, caller profile. This is information about individuals who perhaps need special assistance, facility info, which is blueprints a facility so that responders can respond with greater information as to what to see \u2013 what they will see when they get to the facility and very importantly, caller location. And that is going to be part of our Rave VESTA 911 offer going forward. The second is we are integrating more closely with our enterprise security solution. So, Orchestrate is a key enabler for that. And as part of our full Safety Reimagined program, we are bringing Rave much closer in terms of the ability to detect and the ability to alert using Rave alert and the ability to bridge into 911 as appropriate. So, those two together is really augmenting our path forward in terms of taking advantage of our strength in education, along with our presence with PSAPs. And backlog is up in the unfavorable FX to your other point of $370 million. By the way, the other thing, Sami, is even when we have a large product, much like the Air Force we talked about earlier on the call, it's a $340 million 10-year order, only $11 million of that is logged in backlog. So, I like the composition and the duration of the backlog in addition to it being absolute and at record levels as we exit Q1. Sure. Thank you. Look, I would just say in closing, it was a great Q1, and I think it highlights the fact that what we do has never been more important. Both the demand environment and execution is strong. I am really proud of the people. I am really proud of our channel partners that achieved record Q1 orders, record Q1 backlog. Look, at the end of the day, as we exit Q1, I like our position. More importantly, I like our momentum. And then, again, this is despite the ongoing supply chain challenges that still have to sort of sell-through for the next several quarters. The fact is the intersection, as Mahesh talked about, of public safety and enterprise security, it's critical. And we are building a safety and security technology ecosystem that connects public safety with private institutions, as you heard Jack reference in those key verticals. I couldn't be more proud of this team. And I am optimistic and enthusiastic about the opportunity in front of us. I appreciate you joining, and I look forward to connecting up with you a quarter from now."

            "name": "Jack Molloy",
            "content": "And Tim, specific to cross-sell, what I would do is highlight four specific verticals, starting with government. As we have attested to before, Government was a nascent business when we acquired Avigilon, we made subsequent acquisitions. But just to put it in context, we've kind of put the marker out there this year for a video security business that we would grow approximately 15%. We expect government to grow in the high teens. And we think we've got opportunities to move that. Specifically, I'd also call out healthcare, we're really, really pleased. We won \u2013 we secured a $16 million deal with the large-scale hospital system. This was an add-on. And the beauty of that is they're not only a video user, but they're also a radio user. Education has been we've attested to the fact that numerous school systems are upgrading. Some are going with Avigilon Unity on prime systems, large-scale urban schools. But what we're really seeing is acceleration of growth in the cloud there and the ability to do radio alert and integrate access control, LMR, our command center software product called Compass into school systems is a game changer. And then lastly is the industrial space, namely utilities. We've talked about the fact we've secured a large-scale utility in the past. We've done in the area of $50 million of utility. And I think as utilities start to fortify their power grids and their substations will have incremental cross-sell opportunities there, Tim. But I think the highlight is we tie it all into making sure that we incent our sales force to go and cross-sell, and that's just part of the DNA now. Yes. So George, I would say ARPA, anytime there's federal stimulus dollars are conducive, and I would say, beneficial to the business. But to kind of put it in context, it's approximately 5% of our orders in North America last year. And that's not to diminish it, but I would take it to a higher level. I've actually gone and looked in Salesforce. It's \u2013 they've contributed to deals that were secured, but they for the sole purpose of deals that were secured. I think at the end of the day, when you think about mission-critical communications or even a school, we think we're in an area of prioritization in areas as we've said before, it's a need to have, not a nice to have. So I think it's generally conducive, but it's \u2013 I wouldn't necessarily say it's the largest attributor to our success. Sure, Meta. Maybe I will start with the APX NEXT, and Mahesh will speak to Rave. First of all, we are in the early innings, as we have said before. And I think it's most important to point out that it's a multiyear introduction for the APX NEXT. What typically happens is we have \u2013 we run the APX original and the APX NEXT line in tandem for the foreseeable future. In fact, to point that out 80% in Q1 of our device revenue was actually APX original. So, we have got a coexist and strong pipeline for both of them. We have got $410 million orders since we introduced the APX NEXT. But we have just recently, last fall, introduced the N-Series radio, which starts to fill in the portfolio and now we are bringing out international P25 units to bear that will be targeted in Australia, New Zealand and Israel. All-in, with the new product, what we are seeing is kind of high-single digit ASP increases as well. Sami, I think I would address your inquiry. We have seen strong demand not only big deals, but also the usual type and profile of our business. And I would point to duration. While our backlog is up and at record levels, the duration of our backlog is similar to slightly better than it was last year and it was last quarter. So, not only are we growing backlog, the opportunities we have to convert that backlog within the year are slightly better. So, that's one of the reasons that, again, with our expectations going up for the year, it's driven by that backlog position. Yes. I think a great example. I got a phone call yesterday, Sami, on that specific to a large-scale metropolitan school district. They had three finalists, two of the finalists were Avigilon Alta and Avigilon Unity. And I think that's the power that we can meet a customer for their specific needs that no one else in the marketplace has today. Thank you."

All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. You will have an opportunity to ask questions after today's presentation. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference.\nTim Yocum: Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2024 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO. Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A. We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. And during the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2023 Annual report on Form 10-K or any quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to share a few thoughts before Jason takes you through our results and outlook. First, Q3 was another outstanding quarter with record Q3 revenue and earnings per share that exceeded our guidance. Revenue was up 9% in the quarter, highlighted by 11% growth in Products and SI and 7% growth in software and services, inclusive of the U.K. Home Office revenue reduction. We also expanded operating margins year-over-year for the ninth consecutive quarter, increased earnings per share by 17% and generated record Q3 operating cash flow of over $750 million. Second, demand for our solutions remains robust as we achieved record Q3 orders in all three of our technologies. In LMR, we continue to see customers investing for the long-term with many choosing us to provide software upgrades and value-added services on their networks via multiyear agreements as well as upgrading their devices to our latest APX NEXT family of radios. And in our video and command center technologies, the powerful integration of our software applications across our ecosystem is driving strong demand and contributing to record ending backlog and software and services. And finally, based on our Q3 results and the strong momentum we see across the business. We're again raising our estimates for revenue, earnings per share and cash flow for the full year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 9% and was above our guidance with growth in both segments, both regions and all three technologies. Acquisitions added $36 million during the quarter, while FX headwinds were $4 million. GAAP operating earnings were $711 million or 25.5% of sales up from 25% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $830 million, up 12% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 29.7%, up 70 basis points, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and lower direct material costs, partially offset by the Airwave charge control, higher expenses related to investments in video and higher employee incentives. GAAP earnings per share was $3.29, up from $2.70 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.74, up 17% from $3.19 last year. The growth in EPS was driven by higher sales, favorable mix and a lower effective tax rate. OpEx in Q3 was $617 million, up $66 million versus last year, primarily due to continued investments in video and higher employee incentives. Turning to our cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $759 million, up $45 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $702 million, up $53 million. The increase in year-over-year cash flow was primarily driven by higher earnings. For the full year, we are again raising our operating cash flow guide. We now expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion, up from our previous guide of $2.25 billion. Capital allocation in Q3 included $164 million in cash dividends, $31 million in share repurchases and $57 million in CapEx. Additionally, we closed and funded two acquisitions that we announced on our previous earnings call for $223 million, settled $313 million of 4% senior notes that were due within the quarter, and subsequent to quarter end, we acquired 3tc, an international provider of command center software solutions for $22 million. Moving to our segment results. In the Products and SI segment, sales were up 11% versus last year, driven primarily by growth in LMR. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $11 million, while FX headwinds were $1 million. Operating earnings were $522 million or 29.3% of sales, up from 26.1% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and lower direct material costs. Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in this segment include an $88 million P25 system and device order for a customer in North Africa, a $31 million P25 system for a U.S. state local customer, a $31 million P25 system for a county in Wisconsin, a $25 million P25 system expansion order for Tennessee's statewide network, a $23 million P25 device order for a U.S. federal customer, and a $4 million fixed video order or a U.S. federal customer. In Software and Services revenue was up 7% compared to last year. And when excluding the U.K. Home Office revenue grew 13% with growth in all three technologies. Revenue from acquisitions was $25 million in the quarter and FX headwinds were $3 million. Operating earnings in this segment were $308 million or 30.6% of sales, down from 34% last year due to the impact of the Airwave charge control. Some notable Q3 highlights in the segment of S&S include a $30 million command center order for the state of Utah, an $18 million mobile video order for Sao Paulo State Government in Brazil and a $24 million command center order for Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, which is a significant win, highlighting the demand for our new recurring license model. The solution purchase included our CAD and Records platform as well as numerous cloud-connected capabilities, including the Rave suite. We also were awarded three large LMR contract renewals during the quarter, $191 million from the U.S. Navy, over $100 million for South Carolina statewide network and $84 million for the federal law enforcement agency. Less than $30 million of these $375 million of contracts is in our Q3 ending backlog with the remainder to be recorded ratably over the term of the contracts. Looking at regional results. Next, North America Q3 revenue was $2 billion, up 13% on growth in all three technologies. International Q3 revenue was $783 million, up 1% versus last year, driven by growth in all three technologies offset by the U.K. Home Office revenue reduction. Excluding the U.K. Home Office, our international revenue grew high single digits. Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog for Q3 was $14.1 billion, down $178 million or 1% versus last year due to strong LMR shipments and revenue recognition for the U.K. Home Office, partially offset by multiyear software and service agreements and favorable FX. Sequentially, backlog was up $135 million or 1%, driven by strong growth in multiyear service and software contracts in North America and favorable FX, partially offset by strong LMR shipments and revenue recognition for the U.K. Home Office. In the Products and SI segment, backlog decreased $712 million versus last year and $151 million sequentially, driven by strong LMR shipments. In Software and Services backlog increased $534 million compared to last year and $286 million sequentially, driven by strong demand for multiyear software and services contracts, favorable FX partially offset by revenue recognition for the U.K. Home Office. Turning next to our outlook. For the full year, we now expect revenue growth of 8.25%, up from our prior guidance of approximately 8% and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $13.63 and $13.68 per share, up from our prior guidance of $13.22 per share to $13.30 per share. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Additionally, we now expect full year OpEx of approximately $2.4 billion, driven by higher employee incentives aligned to our performance increased legal spend inclusive of the CMA appeal process and acquisitions. And finally, before turning the call back to Greg, I would like to share a couple of insights on our segments. The strong demand we're seeing for our technologies and our performance is reflected in both of our segments. In Products and SI, the improved supply chain environment has helped us expand margins while normalizing supplier lead times have enabled us to improve our customer delivery times. And in S&S, we've grown double digits year-to-date, excluding the impact of the U.K. Home Office, which began in August of last year. In LMR, our customers continue to choose us as a trusted partner to invest in their networks through long-term multiyear agreements. And in Video and Command Center, cloud solutions continue to grow at a faster pace than on-prem and the investments we've made in the portfolio position us well for this to continue. Finally, our strong cash generation liquidity profile, together with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 gives us significant flexibility in our capital allocation strategy. I'll now turn the call back over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Jason. Let me end with a few thoughts. First, I'm really pleased with how we continue to execute. During the quarter, we generated strong revenue growth in both segments, expanded operating margins by 70 basis points, grew EPS by 17%, generated over $750 million of operating cash flow, and we achieved record Q3 orders in all three technologies. Second, as customers continue to invest in leading-edge technologies our solutions, integrating voice, video and data across public safety and enterprise workflows are becoming increasingly more important to them. Adoption of our command center and video applications that leverage cloud and AI continues to accelerate, which in turn is driving higher recurring revenue in those respective technologies. And in LMR, we're also seeing strong adoption for the broadband-enabled applications on our APX NEXT family of radios. Many of these new applications were on display last month at the annual IACP Conference in Boston and the customer feedback from the event has been overwhelmingly positive. And finally, as we look to close out another record year, I feel really good about the business and our opportunities for continued growth. The prioritization of safety and security remains robust. We're continuing to add value for our customers through new offerings. Our end markets remain resilient, and our strong balance sheet with the lowest net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in almost a decade positions us well for organic and inorganic investments to drive long-term shareholder value. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim.\nTim Yocum: Greg, before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, could you please remind callers on the line how to ask a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is unmuted. Please ask your question.\nBen Bollin: Greg, if I recall, I think in prior years, at the end of 3Q, you've given some thoughts into subsequent to forward year. You shared some thoughts, big picture on funding and growth overall. Curious if you have any more granularity about how you're thinking about \u201825 as we're going into it and any individual perspectives within LMR surveillance command center within that? And then I just have a follow-up.\nGreg Brown: Yes, Ben, thanks for the question. You're right. I think, look, as we sit here in November, I think the color I would give you looking forward to next year is revenue growth of, I'd say, 5% to 6% as we sit here today. That's a prudent view. But that's our current thinking. I think that as it relates to this year, supply chain lead times normalized faster, which is a good thing, which drove a strong 2024. Demand remains strong. As I mentioned just now in comments with both Jason and I, I'm particularly pleased, really pleased that we had record Q3 orders in all three technologies. And as we think about kind of exiting this year into next year, we now expect total backlog to be up versus a quarter ago when we said comparable to slightly up. And while we won't dimensionalize the individual technologies and we'll give you more color in February, I would expect -- obviously, we expect revenue growth in both S&S and products. High level, I see software and services growing about 2x Products and SI for 2025. But I like the overall backlog position, which we now expect to be up, love the record orders position exiting Q3. And if anything, I feel better today than I was a quarter ago, obviously, both about the full year '24 and the momentum heading into next year and we'll give you the details in February.\nJason Winkler: And Greg, I'd add that we expect operating margin expansion as well within S&S. Next year in '25, we'll have the financial comparability of this year having had the Airwave price control relative to next year. So, the S&S segment will have a clean comp. And we'll continue to do what it's done, which is grow and grow operating leverage. And then secondly, within -- even within products, while this year in '24, we had a $70 million benefit for lower semiconductor or PPV relief, we'll have about $20 million and the tail end of it into next year, which should also help operating margins as well.\nGreg Brown: That's right. So, Ben, high level, 5% to 6% next year sitting here in November, software and service is growing about 2x product. And as Jason just appropriately added, we expect continued operating margin expansion and expected cash flow growth with a much smaller PPV contribution in '25. Thanks for the question.\nBen Bollin: That's great. One follow-up for me would be, where are your thoughts, where we stand today on mix of recurring revenue and how you feel about that going forward? That's it for me.\nGreg Brown: Yes. As you know, we talk about software and services as kind of a proxy for recurring revenue. That's kind of why I mentioned our thinking about 2025 with the U.K. Home Office financially from a comp standpoint, pretty much being normalized through the comparable previous periods. We now expect S&S to grow about 2x product. We also see continued adoption on cloud, particularly around video. And we also see more cloud adoption on command center. We think both those trends are favorable. So recurring revenue is healthy and then reoccurring revenue around device refresh and multiyear services as strong as well.\nJason Winkler: And the backlog that supports the recurring nature of that business within S&S is at record levels and continues to grow.\nGreg Brown: Exactly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is unmuted. Please ask your question.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. I just wanted to ask now that we're post-election, I think there's been some confusion from investors on rhetoric regarding potentially reducing public sector spending and the potential impact to MSI. I'm just recalling the last Trump regime was actually fairly helpful to state and local and your core customer base. But it might be a good opportunity to clear the air here. I'm sure you reviewed potential impacts from a variety of outcomes just expected results and impact on your business from the election, understanding it will be a dynamic situation. And I have a follow-up.\nGreg Brown: Yes. First, I think that state and local budgets remain very healthy and strong as Jack could opine on if he wants to jump in. As I talked about, the end user markets are strong, 70% North America is our revenue composition, 75% public safety government. So, we are optimistic in terms of that perspective. From a Trump administration, I think it's positive that thematically, he has been consistent in prioritizing public safety and looking to mitigate crime in large cities and also stem the tide of an open border on immigration, which would require probably head count and technology deployment to help on both those fronts. The administrations referred to tariffs, high level. I remind you that we're pretty unique as it relates to China specifically. We have de minimis revenue exposure to China less than 1% and minimal exposure to them from an end market perspective. And with the Trump administration, we like the fact that there looks like there's certainty now of continuity of corporate tax rate continuity and continuation, which allows a predictable environment, which is always good, I think, from a capital allocation standpoint. And the last thing I'd say is, thematically, I think it will be a more favorable M&A environment versus the current administration. So all ingredients into the mix with this administration, coupled with the continuity of robust state and local budgets, I think it's positive.\nJohn Molloy: The only thing I'd add just on that, Adam, is, as you know, state local but have essentially been funded and it's been a tailwind in terms of inflation. Income tax has been benefited. And we've seen the income tax coffers drive up property taxes have gone up, and that's been beneficial to state and local government. And then sales tax. Revenues are up, which means budgets are up. So, the revenues are a good order, as Greg articulated, the prioritization on our spending is in good order. And I think as we said, the last administration, we had good years between 2016 and 2020 as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joseph Cardoso with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nJoseph Cardoso: Just apologies, I've been jumping on a couple of calls this evening. But maybe just one question for me, and maybe you already had this asked, but curious if you could flesh out any color if it was already asked. Can you just provide an update on where you're expecting the backlog to exit this year from last quarter, I think you said to slightly up? And maybe more specifically, curious if you could flush out any color on contribution from product and services and maybe more specifically on the product side, how you're thinking about the drivers from a portfolio perspective there, just given the easing of the supply chain you're seeing and the drawdown in the backlog you're seeing today?\nJason Winkler: Thanks for the question. So yes, on the last call, we indicated that by year's end this year, we would have expected backlog -- total backlog to be comparable to slightly up. As we update you on this call with the strong Q3 orders we had with records in all three technologies, we now expect that the total backlog for the Company ending this year will be up. and it will be up from last year's record levels. So, the indicators around backlog continue to be strong, supported by the sales funnel and the work that the team is doing in a strong demand environment. In terms of its composition, it's largely consistent with what it's been. And backlog is an important part of how we plan for any one given year. I mentioned earlier, S&S is at record levels and continues to grow. And product backlog remains healthy at over $4 billion as well. So, we're on track to end the year up from last year.\nJoseph Cardoso: Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nAlyssa Shreves: This is Alyssa Shreves on for Tim Long. I had just two quick questions. Gross margins were, I think, a record for this quarter. How should we kind of think about gross margins now moving forward, kind of giving supply chain normalization, you have the APX NEXT product cycle. Is there kind of anything we should be aware of in terms of Q4 and kind of moving into next year? And then I have a follow-up.\nJason Winkler: Alyssa, I would point to the fact that the PPV $70 million of relief is largely behind us. in Q3 ending. So -- and next year, I mentioned on the color that it's pretty small. It's around $20 million. The margin profile but for those items continues to be positive in terms of a mix variable. And with the advent of some of our newer APX NEXT devices, and we're early, early stage on the conversion to those, we would expect continued opportunities for favorable mix. And then complemented by the backlog, OpEx update that we gave, thinking about operating margins continuing to grow. We will have a bit higher OpEx this year. The biggest driver of that is our incentive structure is aligned to our now higher performance.\nAlyssa Shreves: That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. You noticed some nice federal wins in Products and SI this quarter. Can you kind of dimensionalize how large is the federal business now?\nJason Winkler: Last year, it was around $900 million. It's growing this year. And I'll remind everybody that the $900 million is distributed across two components: DoD and then, of course, DHS law enforcement, civil and the likes. But Jack, if you want to talk, you had a strong close to the federal business in Q3, that's in part what drove our Q3 overperformance.\nJohn Molloy: Yes, we did. I think a strong close highlighted by a couple of the services orders but also a strong device refresh. We continue to get uptake from APX to APX NEXT customers. The other thing we're really excited about is we begin shipping the B Series, which gives us another refresh cycle from an infrastructure standpoint as well. So, opportunities there, as well as the federal -- U.S. federal government has been a growth engine for us from a video security standpoint. Very good quarter. The last thing I'd leave you with is that the way the schedule is aligned as we got off to a good start to Q4 with the federal government in terms of new orders as well.\nGreg Brown: Yes. The other nice thing, Alyssa is, I think Joe Balchune, who works for Alloy has done a great job. As Jason mentioned, we're -- we expect it to be over $900 million in revenue this year. The other nice thing, and I'll call it out to what we just talked about earlier, there's two orders comprised in federal for the U.S. Navy and U.S. law enforcement that are about $275 million, of which less than $20 million to $30 million are even recorded in backlog based on the way we record backlog and kind of amortize it over a period of time that's reflected more of the way the projects are funded. So, in addition to the strength in federal over $900 million, the strong close, the strong order activity. I think it's even better in that some of these recent large orders, 90% of them are not reflected in backlog given the way we record it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Guys, this is Brendan on for George. I wanted some color around the video business for next year. I think you guys had cited the $40 million headwind for 2024. Any idea if that's going to grow for next year as customers continue to shift to the cloud?\nGreg Brown: I think it's too early to tell. I think we'll give you that color in February. We're focused -- the video business has done really well. We're pleased with the width and breadth of our portfolio, both fixed and mobile, prem, on-prem and cloud. We did talk about the $40 million headwind, which actually, I think, is favorable because it dimensionalizes customers' acceleration toward cloud and capitalizing on what we have there. But that's really all the detail we'd give you at this point in terms of 2025. Having said that, we're on track and expect to meet the full year guidance we gave on video for this year for '24, which is another good thing.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. And then just one more for me. Last quarter, you guys talked about 25% of shipments coming from APX NEXT. Is that still the right way to think about it? Or is this continued mix shift? Is there any upside there from the last couple of quarters of strength?\nJason Winkler: You're right. Last quarter, we did talk about how our devices business was about 25% of it was coming a little less from APX NEXT that's largely still the case in Q3. And as we look forward, with only 25% of the devices we're shipping today of that variety, there's a long opportunity ahead of us for continuing to deliver those devices to customers.\nJohn Molloy: Yes. And I think that's just -- Jason hit it. I think that just speaks to this is a multiyear horizon of an opportunity for us. That's really with the 25%. You'll continue to see opportunities. We just reviewed it with the team as we look through '25, '26. We'll start to see a continued shift in momentum to APX NEXT. Yes, internationally, we launched the MXP660. Think of that as the TETRA APX NEXT, if you will and we'll start to see a pickup in that. We're already seeing orders, but we'll see a pickup in that in 2025.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nAmit Daryanani: I have two as well. I guess, first off on the video product line item, I think your product revenues in video were down like 3% year-over-year. Can you just talk about what drove the decline? Because one of your peers, I think, reported recently in that number was recorded up double digits in that segment. So, I'm just trying to reconcile the difference. Is it mostly just regions or markets? Or maybe just talk about what drove the decline in the video side?\nJohn Molloy: Yes. So, I think the question was specific to video products. I want to first of all, highlight the fact that our expectations for the full year for the video security remain unchanged, part of that -- part of the dynamic here is higher software attachment rate. And think about that our H6A, which is our AI-related camera, the ACC8, we're seeing more software attachment as well as with Pelco, the Elevate the cloud analytics platform there. This is, I think, just a little bit of a trend that we're seeing reflective of the momentum to the cloud. The last thing I'd highlight is, within video security, there's also a mobile security reported in our numbers. And last year, we had a 24% growth in terms of mobile video products, which presented from a product standpoint, a little bit of a lumpy comp that we're measured against.\nJack Molloy: Yes. So, Amit.\nJohn Molloy: I think it\u2019s Jack's right.\nJack Molloy: Higher software content, the 24% component previous base comp. And then as we said, aggressive adoption of cloud, I think Mahesh, we view favorably.\nMahesh Saptharishi: That's right. And on the mobile video aspect that Jack highlighted, 60% of our customers today are as a service. And that's a big part of this as well.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. That's really helpful. And then Greg, when you were talking about just things post-election, you sort of talked about a more favorable M&A environment, I think, in your answer. I'd love to understand as you think about '25 and maybe even beyond that. This capital allocation do you change fundamentally under a different administration versus what you've had before. And how do you sort of think about M&A going forward versus what you've done in the past? I'm really wondering like are there larger deals that you are perhaps hesitant to do because you thought you're going to get them through the finish line that you might be more open to do now? Let me just understand how this cap allocation, M&A appetite change under a different administration.\nGreg Brown: I don't -- it's a good question. I was describing more the M&A environment from a macro standpoint. I don't think it changes per se for us, even though we've only done a couple of deals, I will tell you, we and I have been as engaged on M&A this year as ever before. The funnel is robust. The opportunities are numerable. And as you know, the capital allocation framework, 55%, 25%, 15%, 55% of operating cash flow is always available in a normalized way to either do share repo or inorganic acquisition. We've been in a number of conversations, and I think the environment is healthy. My commentary around the Trump administration was more around the leadership in the FTC and the overall climate, I don't think it changes much for us this year versus next year in the sense that I think the M&A environment is attractive. The reasons we haven't gotten some things done I think, are -- because we want to not just do the right thing, but do it the right way, make sure we are getting something that can generate long-term value has cultural compatibility. We can deliver on the synergies. We minimize technical debt. We can integrate it into the architecture. It's flexible around cloud adoption. We can retain talent. We can add talent. But we've invested over $6 billion of inorganic acquisition over the last nine years. And as I mentioned, I think the opportunities are significant, and I'm optimistic about that. And coupled with what Jason mentioned, right, our balance sheet also is in as good a shape as it's been in a long time. with net debt to EBITDA and the ratio being as good as it's been in about 10 years. So, I think the dry powder, the opportunities, the engagements are very good. I think the environment is good for us today, and I think it will be as good, maybe incrementally more favorable tomorrow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rodney McFall with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nRodney McFall: Just a quick one on the recent acquisition of 3tc. I don't believe this is your first U.K. control room software acquisition. So just curious, what does this provide for you? And how does this work with your prior acquisitions?\nMahesh Saptharishi: Rodney, the control room solutions that we sell in the U.S. are growing for us. 3tc is part of that. There are two components to it, one called integrated call control systems, and the other part is CAD and CAD is what 3tc provides. And we have actually been selling 3tc as an integrated part of our control room solutions for a while. And this acquisition just enables us to bring that in-house, improve our margins and also give us the right platform for growth going forward.\nRodney McFall: Got it. I guess just a quick follow-up. Just curious on command center adoption in the U.S. What's the penetration rate there? And what is the barrier to growing that business faster? And maybe just some color on how that business is going internationally.\nMahesh Saptharishi: So, we are now number one both in CAD and Records in North America. Cloud is starting to catch on. Maricopa County Sheriff's office deal that Jason mentioned is, I think, a key part of what we're seeing both in terms of more customers preferring a recurring revenue model, a subscription model and adding on SaaS solutions on top of it. Overall, over 60% of our customers today have at least one cloud attached component, and that's continuing to grow. And we expect to see a full 9% growth this year for command center.\nRodney McFall: Got you.\nJason Winkler: So just to add on market share. I mean the market is growing less than that. I think the command center outlook for the year is 10%, Q3 was 9%. But we're -- in those numbers, we're taking shares. The market is not growing at those rates. So positive with the cloud investments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tomer Zilberman from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nTomer Zilberman: Maybe going back to some of the earlier backlog questions that were asked. When you think about -- and maybe I'm getting ahead of myself here, but when you think about the '25 guide for 5% to 6% growth, where do you think the -- what do you think the product backlog contribution is if we assume that we get to maybe a $4 billion level this year, will this go back to your historical $3 billion level? And how does that impact your thoughts around the LMR growth rate? Do you think that we still sustain that mid- to high single-digit growth rate going into next year?\nGreg Brown: So, we do expect LMR to grow. We matured to dimensionalize. We talked about total backlog. We now expect it to grow up year-over-year. That's a good thing. Product backlog remains healthy. Even sequentially, it's still north of $4 billion. I think the record orders in all three technologies, although in this case in the context of your question, LMR, record orders is another favorable indication. So too early to give you that dimensionalization. But I feel good about the momentum of the business, the segment momentum of the business and the technology momentum of the business. And maybe that gives you a little bit more granularity. It may not fully scratch the itch, but that's the best I can give you, but we'll update you in February.\nTomer Zilberman: Sure. No worries. And maybe asking another question, shifting gears a bit. You've talked before about getting more aggressive on subscription sales. And if I'm not mistaken, I think you've informed your sales force to try and sell everything now as a subscription. Just wanted to talk about how that's going. Any changes in the go-to-market that you're making to enable that? I believe you put the Rave CEO as Head of Subscription Sales. So just any commentary you can give on trends you see there?\nGreg Brown: Yes. Just to clarify, Tomer, we're not pushing everything as a subscription. What I would tell you, if you think about SaaS or cloud, I mean, we talked about video and Avigilon Alta, growing exponentially faster than prem video. We like that trend. We talked about command center, just a few minutes ago, which we've always offered as a hybrid solution, which I think is really good because it allows customers to evolve at their pace. And we see and Mahesh just talked about increased adoption around command center cloud, things -- yes like Rave, but also things like call handling. And we also talked about even though APX NEXT family of devices shipped is less than 25%, I love the fact that a lot of those APX NEXT family shipments come with the broadband adoption of applications. We love that; a, it's recurring revenue; b, it's sticky; and c, it provides connective tissue with those critical applications in the APX NEXT device that communicate and interoperate with the command center and the integrated workflow applications that Mahesh is building. So, we didn't wave a wand and said, force everything SaaS. We meet our customers where they are. Video recurring and cloud is growing fast, a number faster as a multiple than prem, love the adoption of Command Center, love the APX NEXT application broadband apps uptick and adoption rate, we think those trends are favorable.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nMeta Marshall: You guys noted strong traction with the MXP660 earlier in the call kind of ramping in 2025. But just any way to kind of contextualize that versus some of the ramps we've seen throughout the APX NEXT portfolio? And then just as a second question, any kind of change to how you guys are viewing kind of resolution of kind of the U.K. Home Office Airwave type situations?\nGreg Brown: Yes. Meta, in terms of the MXP660, I think the horse just left the starting gate and is kind of coming through the first turn a little bit. So, a little too early to kind of extrapolate or give you any kind of predictive traction. We love the fact that it's an available option in European markets now that capitalize on broadband, both for LMR and 4G integrated into one device that gives you enhanced location broadband applications over-the-air software reprogramming and roaming on an LMR TETRA and/or 4G networks. So, we love all the available features that, that brings, but it's still early. In terms of the U.K., there's a hearing next Monday, Tuesday in the U.K. on our multiyear challenge to the CMA and the CAT ruling. Really nothing to report. The hearing will take place Monday, Tuesday. After that, they'll reach some decision. My expectation is a decision either by the end of the year or early 2025 that would give us a little more color that in turn, we would, of course share with you transparently. But it's the long winding road of challenging what we think is an unlawful action that was taken on a contract, a binding multiyear agreement that we had with the U.K. Home Office. So, stay tuned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryce Sandberg with William Blair. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nBryce Sandberg: Another one on M&A. As you look out at the market, are there any particular product or market areas that you're focusing on or they look particularly attractive? Or is it kind of broad-based across the portfolio?\nGreg Brown: I think it's primarily around video software and services that we focus on from a product standpoint or a more -- less product, more category. I think it's an active funnel. We've had engagements with multiple companies of varying sizes. But those are kind of the lanes that we continue to pursue and our conversations are around video software services.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks.\nGreg Brown: Yes, thanks. I just, first of all, want to thank all the employees of Motorola, particularly our sales and support teams for driving record Q3 orders. The other thing I would be remiss in not recognizing especially this past quarter after severe hurricanes of Helene and Milton that were devastating. I'm proud of our people. I'm proud of our channel partners that worked tirelessly and around the clock to ensure that our systems were up and available as they always are in these devastating natural disasters. I appreciate all of their hard work. And then lastly, I would just say I'm encouraged as we are sitting here in November with what the rest of the year holds and the momentum I see into next year, our vibrant end markets. We expect the year to close with total backlog up off of record levels, and I'm encouraged by the continued high demand and the active engagements around the globe. I appreciate all the Motorola employees channel partners and everybody that does their part in having to spend a great quarter and us continuing our momentum. I really appreciate it.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Winkler",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 9% and was above our guidance with growth in both segments, both regions and all three technologies. Acquisitions added $36 million during the quarter, while FX headwinds were $4 million. GAAP operating earnings were $711 million or 25.5% of sales up from 25% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $830 million, up 12% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 29.7%, up 70 basis points, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and lower direct material costs, partially offset by the Airwave charge control, higher expenses related to investments in video and higher employee incentives. GAAP earnings per share was $3.29, up from $2.70 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.74, up 17% from $3.19 last year. The growth in EPS was driven by higher sales, favorable mix and a lower effective tax rate. OpEx in Q3 was $617 million, up $66 million versus last year, primarily due to continued investments in video and higher employee incentives. Turning to our cash flow. Q3 operating cash flow was $759 million, up $45 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $702 million, up $53 million. The increase in year-over-year cash flow was primarily driven by higher earnings. For the full year, we are again raising our operating cash flow guide. We now expect full year operating cash flow of approximately $2.3 billion, up from our previous guide of $2.25 billion. Capital allocation in Q3 included $164 million in cash dividends, $31 million in share repurchases and $57 million in CapEx. Additionally, we closed and funded two acquisitions that we announced on our previous earnings call for $223 million, settled $313 million of 4% senior notes that were due within the quarter, and subsequent to quarter end, we acquired 3tc, an international provider of command center software solutions for $22 million. Moving to our segment results. In the Products and SI segment, sales were up 11% versus last year, driven primarily by growth in LMR. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $11 million, while FX headwinds were $1 million. Operating earnings were $522 million or 29.3% of sales, up from 26.1% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and lower direct material costs. Some notable Q3 wins and achievements in this segment include an $88 million P25 system and device order for a customer in North Africa, a $31 million P25 system for a U.S. state local customer, a $31 million P25 system for a county in Wisconsin, a $25 million P25 system expansion order for Tennessee's statewide network, a $23 million P25 device order for a U.S. federal customer, and a $4 million fixed video order or a U.S. federal customer. In Software and Services revenue was up 7% compared to last year. And when excluding the U.K. Home Office revenue grew 13% with growth in all three technologies. Revenue from acquisitions was $25 million in the quarter and FX headwinds were $3 million. Operating earnings in this segment were $308 million or 30.6% of sales, down from 34% last year due to the impact of the Airwave charge control. Some notable Q3 highlights in the segment of S&S include a $30 million command center order for the state of Utah, an $18 million mobile video order for Sao Paulo State Government in Brazil and a $24 million command center order for Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, which is a significant win, highlighting the demand for our new recurring license model. The solution purchase included our CAD and Records platform as well as numerous cloud-connected capabilities, including the Rave suite. We also were awarded three large LMR contract renewals during the quarter, $191 million from the U.S. Navy, over $100 million for South Carolina statewide network and $84 million for the federal law enforcement agency. Less than $30 million of these $375 million of contracts is in our Q3 ending backlog with the remainder to be recorded ratably over the term of the contracts. Looking at regional results. Next, North America Q3 revenue was $2 billion, up 13% on growth in all three technologies. International Q3 revenue was $783 million, up 1% versus last year, driven by growth in all three technologies offset by the U.K. Home Office revenue reduction. Excluding the U.K. Home Office, our international revenue grew high single digits. Moving to our backlog. Ending backlog for Q3 was $14.1 billion, down $178 million or 1% versus last year due to strong LMR shipments and revenue recognition for the U.K. Home Office, partially offset by multiyear software and service agreements and favorable FX. Sequentially, backlog was up $135 million or 1%, driven by strong growth in multiyear service and software contracts in North America and favorable FX, partially offset by strong LMR shipments and revenue recognition for the U.K. Home Office. In the Products and SI segment, backlog decreased $712 million versus last year and $151 million sequentially, driven by strong LMR shipments. In Software and Services backlog increased $534 million compared to last year and $286 million sequentially, driven by strong demand for multiyear software and services contracts, favorable FX partially offset by revenue recognition for the U.K. Home Office. Turning next to our outlook. For the full year, we now expect revenue growth of 8.25%, up from our prior guidance of approximately 8% and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $13.63 and $13.68 per share, up from our prior guidance of $13.22 per share to $13.30 per share. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Additionally, we now expect full year OpEx of approximately $2.4 billion, driven by higher employee incentives aligned to our performance increased legal spend inclusive of the CMA appeal process and acquisitions. And finally, before turning the call back to Greg, I would like to share a couple of insights on our segments. The strong demand we're seeing for our technologies and our performance is reflected in both of our segments. In Products and SI, the improved supply chain environment has helped us expand margins while normalizing supplier lead times have enabled us to improve our customer delivery times. And in S&S, we've grown double digits year-to-date, excluding the impact of the U.K. Home Office, which began in August of last year. In LMR, our customers continue to choose us as a trusted partner to invest in their networks through long-term multiyear agreements. And in Video and Command Center, cloud solutions continue to grow at a faster pace than on-prem and the investments we've made in the portfolio position us well for this to continue. Finally, our strong cash generation liquidity profile, together with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4 gives us significant flexibility in our capital allocation strategy. I'll now turn the call back over to Greg. And Greg, I'd add that we expect operating margin expansion as well within S&S. Next year in '25, we'll have the financial comparability of this year having had the Airwave price control relative to next year. So, the S&S segment will have a clean comp. And we'll continue to do what it's done, which is grow and grow operating leverage. And then secondly, within -- even within products, while this year in '24, we had a $70 million benefit for lower semiconductor or PPV relief, we'll have about $20 million and the tail end of it into next year, which should also help operating margins as well. And the backlog that supports the recurring nature of that business within S&S is at record levels and continues to grow. Thanks for the question. So yes, on the last call, we indicated that by year's end this year, we would have expected backlog -- total backlog to be comparable to slightly up. As we update you on this call with the strong Q3 orders we had with records in all three technologies, we now expect that the total backlog for the Company ending this year will be up. and it will be up from last year's record levels. So, the indicators around backlog continue to be strong, supported by the sales funnel and the work that the team is doing in a strong demand environment. In terms of its composition, it's largely consistent with what it's been. And backlog is an important part of how we plan for any one given year. I mentioned earlier, S&S is at record levels and continues to grow. And product backlog remains healthy at over $4 billion as well. So, we're on track to end the year up from last year. Alyssa, I would point to the fact that the PPV $70 million of relief is largely behind us. in Q3 ending. So -- and next year, I mentioned on the color that it's pretty small. It's around $20 million. The margin profile but for those items continues to be positive in terms of a mix variable. And with the advent of some of our newer APX NEXT devices, and we're early, early stage on the conversion to those, we would expect continued opportunities for favorable mix. And then complemented by the backlog, OpEx update that we gave, thinking about operating margins continuing to grow. We will have a bit higher OpEx this year. The biggest driver of that is our incentive structure is aligned to our now higher performance. Last year, it was around $900 million. It's growing this year. And I'll remind everybody that the $900 million is distributed across two components: DoD and then, of course, DHS law enforcement, civil and the likes. But Jack, if you want to talk, you had a strong close to the federal business in Q3, that's in part what drove our Q3 overperformance. You're right. Last quarter, we did talk about how our devices business was about 25% of it was coming a little less from APX NEXT that's largely still the case in Q3. And as we look forward, with only 25% of the devices we're shipping today of that variety, there's a long opportunity ahead of us for continuing to deliver those devices to customers. So just to add on market share. I mean the market is growing less than that. I think the command center outlook for the year is 10%, Q3 was 9%. But we're -- in those numbers, we're taking shares. The market is not growing at those rates. So positive with the cloud investments."

            "name": "John Molloy",
            "content": "The only thing I'd add just on that, Adam, is, as you know, state local but have essentially been funded and it's been a tailwind in terms of inflation. Income tax has been benefited. And we've seen the income tax coffers drive up property taxes have gone up, and that's been beneficial to state and local government. And then sales tax. Revenues are up, which means budgets are up. So, the revenues are a good order, as Greg articulated, the prioritization on our spending is in good order. And I think as we said, the last administration, we had good years between 2016 and 2020 as well. Yes, we did. I think a strong close highlighted by a couple of the services orders but also a strong device refresh. We continue to get uptake from APX to APX NEXT customers. The other thing we're really excited about is we begin shipping the B Series, which gives us another refresh cycle from an infrastructure standpoint as well. So, opportunities there, as well as the federal -- U.S. federal government has been a growth engine for us from a video security standpoint. Very good quarter. The last thing I'd leave you with is that the way the schedule is aligned as we got off to a good start to Q4 with the federal government in terms of new orders as well. Yes. And I think that's just -- Jason hit it. I think that just speaks to this is a multiyear horizon of an opportunity for us. That's really with the 25%. You'll continue to see opportunities. We just reviewed it with the team as we look through '25, '26. We'll start to see a continued shift in momentum to APX NEXT. Yes, internationally, we launched the MXP660. Think of that as the TETRA APX NEXT, if you will and we'll start to see a pickup in that. We're already seeing orders, but we'll see a pickup in that in 2025. Yes. So, I think the question was specific to video products. I want to first of all, highlight the fact that our expectations for the full year for the video security remain unchanged, part of that -- part of the dynamic here is higher software attachment rate. And think about that our H6A, which is our AI-related camera, the ACC8, we're seeing more software attachment as well as with Pelco, the Elevate the cloud analytics platform there. This is, I think, just a little bit of a trend that we're seeing reflective of the momentum to the cloud. The last thing I'd highlight is, within video security, there's also a mobile security reported in our numbers. And last year, we had a 24% growth in terms of mobile video products, which presented from a product standpoint, a little bit of a lumpy comp that we're measured against. I think it's Jack's right."

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to share a few thoughts before Jason takes you through our results and outlook. First, Q3 was another outstanding quarter with record Q3 revenue and earnings per share that exceeded our guidance. Revenue was up 9% in the quarter, highlighted by 11% growth in Products and SI and 7% growth in software and services, inclusive of the U.K. Home Office revenue reduction. We also expanded operating margins year-over-year for the ninth consecutive quarter, increased earnings per share by 17% and generated record Q3 operating cash flow of over $750 million. Second, demand for our solutions remains robust as we achieved record Q3 orders in all three of our technologies. In LMR, we continue to see customers investing for the long-term with many choosing us to provide software upgrades and value-added services on their networks via multiyear agreements as well as upgrading their devices to our latest APX NEXT family of radios. And in our video and command center technologies, the powerful integration of our software applications across our ecosystem is driving strong demand and contributing to record ending backlog and software and services. And finally, based on our Q3 results and the strong momentum we see across the business. We're again raising our estimates for revenue, earnings per share and cash flow for the full year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jason. Thanks, Jason. Let me end with a few thoughts. First, I'm really pleased with how we continue to execute. During the quarter, we generated strong revenue growth in both segments, expanded operating margins by 70 basis points, grew EPS by 17%, generated over $750 million of operating cash flow, and we achieved record Q3 orders in all three technologies. Second, as customers continue to invest in leading-edge technologies our solutions, integrating voice, video and data across public safety and enterprise workflows are becoming increasingly more important to them. Adoption of our command center and video applications that leverage cloud and AI continues to accelerate, which in turn is driving higher recurring revenue in those respective technologies. And in LMR, we're also seeing strong adoption for the broadband-enabled applications on our APX NEXT family of radios. Many of these new applications were on display last month at the annual IACP Conference in Boston and the customer feedback from the event has been overwhelmingly positive. And finally, as we look to close out another record year, I feel really good about the business and our opportunities for continued growth. The prioritization of safety and security remains robust. We're continuing to add value for our customers through new offerings. Our end markets remain resilient, and our strong balance sheet with the lowest net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in almost a decade positions us well for organic and inorganic investments to drive long-term shareholder value. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Yes, Ben, thanks for the question. You're right. I think, look, as we sit here in November, I think the color I would give you looking forward to next year is revenue growth of, I'd say, 5% to 6% as we sit here today. That's a prudent view. But that's our current thinking. I think that as it relates to this year, supply chain lead times normalized faster, which is a good thing, which drove a strong 2024. Demand remains strong. As I mentioned just now in comments with both Jason and I, I'm particularly pleased, really pleased that we had record Q3 orders in all three technologies. And as we think about kind of exiting this year into next year, we now expect total backlog to be up versus a quarter ago when we said comparable to slightly up. And while we won't dimensionalize the individual technologies and we'll give you more color in February, I would expect -- obviously, we expect revenue growth in both S&S and products. High level, I see software and services growing about 2x Products and SI for 2025. But I like the overall backlog position, which we now expect to be up, love the record orders position exiting Q3. And if anything, I feel better today than I was a quarter ago, obviously, both about the full year '24 and the momentum heading into next year and we'll give you the details in February. That's right. So, Ben, high level, 5% to 6% next year sitting here in November, software and service is growing about 2x product. And as Jason just appropriately added, we expect continued operating margin expansion and expected cash flow growth with a much smaller PPV contribution in '25. Thanks for the question. Yes. As you know, we talk about software and services as kind of a proxy for recurring revenue. That's kind of why I mentioned our thinking about 2025 with the U.K. Home Office financially from a comp standpoint, pretty much being normalized through the comparable previous periods. We now expect S&S to grow about 2x product. We also see continued adoption on cloud, particularly around video. And we also see more cloud adoption on command center. We think both those trends are favorable. So recurring revenue is healthy and then reoccurring revenue around device refresh and multiyear services as strong as well. Exactly. Yes. First, I think that state and local budgets remain very healthy and strong as Jack could opine on if he wants to jump in. As I talked about, the end user markets are strong, 70% North America is our revenue composition, 75% public safety government. So, we are optimistic in terms of that perspective. From a Trump administration, I think it's positive that thematically, he has been consistent in prioritizing public safety and looking to mitigate crime in large cities and also stem the tide of an open border on immigration, which would require probably head count and technology deployment to help on both those fronts. The administrations referred to tariffs, high level. I remind you that we're pretty unique as it relates to China specifically. We have de minimis revenue exposure to China less than 1% and minimal exposure to them from an end market perspective. And with the Trump administration, we like the fact that there looks like there's certainty now of continuity of corporate tax rate continuity and continuation, which allows a predictable environment, which is always good, I think, from a capital allocation standpoint. And the last thing I'd say is, thematically, I think it will be a more favorable M&A environment versus the current administration. So all ingredients into the mix with this administration, coupled with the continuity of robust state and local budgets, I think it's positive. Yes. The other nice thing, Alyssa is, I think Joe Balchune, who works for Alloy has done a great job. As Jason mentioned, we're -- we expect it to be over $900 million in revenue this year. The other nice thing, and I'll call it out to what we just talked about earlier, there's two orders comprised in federal for the U.S. Navy and U.S. law enforcement that are about $275 million, of which less than $20 million to $30 million are even recorded in backlog based on the way we record backlog and kind of amortize it over a period of time that's reflected more of the way the projects are funded. So, in addition to the strength in federal over $900 million, the strong close, the strong order activity. I think it's even better in that some of these recent large orders, 90% of them are not reflected in backlog given the way we record it. I think it's too early to tell. I think we'll give you that color in February. We're focused -- the video business has done really well. We're pleased with the width and breadth of our portfolio, both fixed and mobile, prem, on-prem and cloud. We did talk about the $40 million headwind, which actually, I think, is favorable because it dimensionalizes customers' acceleration toward cloud and capitalizing on what we have there. But that's really all the detail we'd give you at this point in terms of 2025. Having said that, we're on track and expect to meet the full year guidance we gave on video for this year for '24, which is another good thing. I don't -- it's a good question. I was describing more the M&A environment from a macro standpoint. I don't think it changes per se for us, even though we've only done a couple of deals, I will tell you, we and I have been as engaged on M&A this year as ever before. The funnel is robust. The opportunities are numerable. And as you know, the capital allocation framework, 55%, 25%, 15%, 55% of operating cash flow is always available in a normalized way to either do share repo or inorganic acquisition. We've been in a number of conversations, and I think the environment is healthy. My commentary around the Trump administration was more around the leadership in the FTC and the overall climate, I don't think it changes much for us this year versus next year in the sense that I think the M&A environment is attractive. The reasons we haven't gotten some things done I think, are -- because we want to not just do the right thing, but do it the right way, make sure we are getting something that can generate long-term value has cultural compatibility. We can deliver on the synergies. We minimize technical debt. We can integrate it into the architecture. It's flexible around cloud adoption. We can retain talent. We can add talent. But we've invested over $6 billion of inorganic acquisition over the last nine years. And as I mentioned, I think the opportunities are significant, and I'm optimistic about that. And coupled with what Jason mentioned, right, our balance sheet also is in as good a shape as it's been in a long time. with net debt to EBITDA and the ratio being as good as it's been in about 10 years. So, I think the dry powder, the opportunities, the engagements are very good. I think the environment is good for us today, and I think it will be as good, maybe incrementally more favorable tomorrow. So, we do expect LMR to grow. We matured to dimensionalize. We talked about total backlog. We now expect it to grow up year-over-year. That's a good thing. Product backlog remains healthy. Even sequentially, it's still north of $4 billion. I think the record orders in all three technologies, although in this case in the context of your question, LMR, record orders is another favorable indication. So too early to give you that dimensionalization. But I feel good about the momentum of the business, the segment momentum of the business and the technology momentum of the business. And maybe that gives you a little bit more granularity. It may not fully scratch the itch, but that's the best I can give you, but we'll update you in February. Yes. Just to clarify, Tomer, we're not pushing everything as a subscription. What I would tell you, if you think about SaaS or cloud, I mean, we talked about video and Avigilon Alta, growing exponentially faster than prem video. We like that trend. We talked about command center, just a few minutes ago, which we've always offered as a hybrid solution, which I think is really good because it allows customers to evolve at their pace. And we see and Mahesh just talked about increased adoption around command center cloud, things -- yes like Rave, but also things like call handling. And we also talked about even though APX NEXT family of devices shipped is less than 25%, I love the fact that a lot of those APX NEXT family shipments come with the broadband adoption of applications. We love that; a, it's recurring revenue; b, it's sticky; and c, it provides connective tissue with those critical applications in the APX NEXT device that communicate and interoperate with the command center and the integrated workflow applications that Mahesh is building. So, we didn't wave a wand and said, force everything SaaS. We meet our customers where they are. Video recurring and cloud is growing fast, a number faster as a multiple than prem, love the adoption of Command Center, love the APX NEXT application broadband apps uptick and adoption rate, we think those trends are favorable. Yes. Meta, in terms of the MXP660, I think the horse just left the starting gate and is kind of coming through the first turn a little bit. So, a little too early to kind of extrapolate or give you any kind of predictive traction. We love the fact that it's an available option in European markets now that capitalize on broadband, both for LMR and 4G integrated into one device that gives you enhanced location broadband applications over-the-air software reprogramming and roaming on an LMR TETRA and/or 4G networks. So, we love all the available features that, that brings, but it's still early. In terms of the U.K., there's a hearing next Monday, Tuesday in the U.K. on our multiyear challenge to the CMA and the CAT ruling. Really nothing to report. The hearing will take place Monday, Tuesday. After that, they'll reach some decision. My expectation is a decision either by the end of the year or early 2025 that would give us a little more color that in turn, we would, of course share with you transparently. But it's the long winding road of challenging what we think is an unlawful action that was taken on a contract, a binding multiyear agreement that we had with the U.K. Home Office. So, stay tuned. I think it's primarily around video software and services that we focus on from a product standpoint or a more -- less product, more category. I think it's an active funnel. We've had engagements with multiple companies of varying sizes. But those are kind of the lanes that we continue to pursue and our conversations are around video software services. Yes, thanks. I just, first of all, want to thank all the employees of Motorola, particularly our sales and support teams for driving record Q3 orders. The other thing I would be remiss in not recognizing especially this past quarter after severe hurricanes of Helene and Milton that were devastating. I'm proud of our people. I'm proud of our channel partners that worked tirelessly and around the clock to ensure that our systems were up and available as they always are in these devastating natural disasters. I appreciate all of their hard work. And then lastly, I would just say I'm encouraged as we are sitting here in November with what the rest of the year holds and the momentum I see into next year, our vibrant end markets. We expect the year to close with total backlog up off of record levels, and I'm encouraged by the continued high demand and the active engagements around the globe. I appreciate all the Motorola employees channel partners and everybody that does their part in having to spend a great quarter and us continuing our momentum. I really appreciate it."

            "content": "That's right. And on the mobile video aspect that Jack highlighted, 60% of our customers today are as a service. And that's a big part of this as well. Rodney, the control room solutions that we sell in the U.S. are growing for us. 3tc is part of that. There are two components to it, one called integrated call control systems, and the other part is CAD and CAD is what 3tc provides. And we have actually been selling 3tc as an integrated part of our control room solutions for a while. And this acquisition just enables us to bring that in-house, improve our margins and also give us the right platform for growth going forward. So, we are now number one both in CAD and Records in North America. Cloud is starting to catch on. Maricopa County Sheriff's office deal that Jason mentioned is, I think, a key part of what we're seeing both in terms of more customers preferring a recurring revenue model, a subscription model and adding on SaaS solutions on top of it. Overall, over 60% of our customers today have at least one cloud attached component, and that's continuing to grow. And we expect to see a full 9% growth this year for command center."

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and outlook. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter with record Q2 revenue and operating earnings. Products and SI revenue was up 15% and operating earnings were up 56%, driven by continued strong demand and favorable mix within LMR products. In Software and Services, revenue was flat, excluding the home office, from the UK, revenue was up 11%, driven by strength in all three technologies. And we also increased earnings per share by 22%, generated $180 million of operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $14 billion of backlog, positioning us well for our continued growth. Second, I'm encouraged by the continued momentum we are seeing across the business. In Video Security, revenue was up 10%, driven by growth in both our fixed and mobile video solutions and increasing in software and services. In Command Center, revenue increased 9%, as customers continue to adopt our solutions that help them effectively accelerate response and resolution of incidence. And in LMR, revenue increased 9%, inclusive of the UK Home Office headwinds driven by LMR products as well as Managed and Support Services. And finally, based on our Q2 results, robust demand and continued prioritization for safety and security by our customers, we are again raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full-year. I'll now turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 9% and was above our guidance with strong growth in all three technologies. Acquisitions added $13 million, while FX headwinds were $5 million during the quarter. GAAP operating earnings were $644 million or 24.5% of sales, up from 21.6% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $758 million, up 18% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 28.8%, up 210 basis points, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and improved operating leverage partially offset by the Airwave Charge Control. GAAP earnings per share was $2.60, up from $2.15 in the year ago quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.24, up 22% from $2.65 last year. The growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter. OpEx in Q2 was $593 million, up $38 million versus last year, primarily due to higher employee incentives and acquisitions. Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $180 million, up $87 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $112 million, up $72 million. These increases were primarily driven by higher earnings partially offset by higher employee incentives and higher cash taxes. Our year-to-date operating cash flow was $562 million, up from $85 million in the previous year on higher earnings and significantly improved working capital. And we now expect operating cash flow for the full-year to be $2.25 billion, an increase of $50 million versus our prior expectations and double-digit growth expectations over last year. Capital allocation for Q2 included $163 million in cash dividends, $71 million in share repurchases and $68 million of CapEx. Subsequent to the quarter end, we also closed two acquisitions for a total of $223 million. The first is a global provider of critical event management software that expands our command center presence internationally and also complements our Rave acquisition. The second is a provider of vehicle location and management solutions that further builds on our leadership in providing mobile video solutions for the financial services sector. We expect these acquisitions to generate approximately $15 million to $20 million of revenue per quarter primarily in video and to be slightly dilutive to the second half of this year. Moving to segment results in Products and SI, sales were up 15% versus last year, driven by continued demand along with improvements in supply in LMR. Currency headwinds were $2 million in revenue from acquisitions contributed $12 million. Operating earnings were $445 million or 26.8% of sales, up from 19.8%, in the prior year, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include a $32 million P25 system and device order for the city of Naperville, Illinois, a $19 million P25 system upgrade for Washington County, Virginia, an $18 million P25 system order for a U.S. Federal customer, a $17 million P25 device order for a U.S. customer, an $8 million fixed video order for a large state and local customer and a $6 million video order for Newark Public Schools in New Jersey. In Software and Services, revenue was flat compared to last year, excluding the UK Home Office, revenue was up 11%, driven by strength in all three technologies. Revenue from acquisitions was $1 million in the quarter, and FX headwinds were $3 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $313 million or 32.3% of sales, down from 36.9% last year due to the revenue reduction related to the Airwave Charge Control, which was partially offset by improved operating leverage elsewhere in the segment. Excluding the UK Home Office, software and services operating margins increased during the quarter on higher sales and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q2 highlights in this segment include a $19 million LMR order for the Victorian State Government in Australia, an $18 million LMR order for a U.S. Federal customer, a $12 million Command Center order for the Las Vegas Metro Police Department, an $11 million LMR order for American Airlines. And finally, we received a $16 million mobile video award with Police Scotland. This award was part of a $30 million investment made by Police Scotland to procure body-worn cameras, LMR radios and mobile application software, demonstrating their recognition of the strength of our integrated ecosystem. Looking at regional results. North America Q2 revenue was $1.9 billion, up 17% on growth in all three technologies. International Q2 revenue was $711 million, down 7% versus last year due to the impact of the Airwave Charge Control. Excluding the UK Home Office, international revenue was up mid-single digits with growth in all three technologies. Moving to backlog. Ending total backlog for Q2 was $14 billion, a decrease of approximately $300 million or 2% versus last year. Excluding the UK Home Office, total backlog was $12.5 billion, up from $12.4 billion last year. In the Products and SI segment ending backlog decreased $482 million versus last year and $308 million sequentially, driven by strong LMR shipments as supplier lead time improvements enabled us to ship additional products earlier in the year and improve our sales linearity. In software and services backlog increased $164 million compared to last year, driven by multi-year software and services contracts across all three technologies, partially offset by 12 months of revenue recognition from the UK Home Office. Sequentially, backlog was down $129 million, primarily driven by the quarterly revenue recognition for the UK home office. Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales growth between 7% and 8%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.32 and $3.37 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 170 million shares and an effective tax rate of 24%. For the full-year, we are again increasing both our revenue and earnings per share guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 8%, up from our prior guidance of approximately 7%, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $13.22 and $13.30 per share, up from our prior guide of $12.98 to $13.08 per share. The full-year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5%. It also assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points, up from our prior expectation of 75 basis points, driven by higher sales. And finally, before turning the call back to Greg, I wanted to share some insights regarding our increased expectations for the year. In video, we now expect approximately 12% of growth for the full-year, inclusive of the recent M&A. Video continues to be an exciting opportunity for us with new products like ACC 8 video management system, H6 cameras, our latest AI-enabled video recorder and both cloud and on-premises offers. And for LMR, we are increasing our expectations to mid to high single-digit growth for the full-year, which includes the headwinds related to the UK Home Office that we communicated at the beginning of the year. On the continued strength of LMR, I'd point to a couple of important drivers. First, in LMR services, we have a significant installed base, and our customers are increasingly relying on our expanded services offerings such as cyber and software upgrade agreements as they continue to invest in their networks for the long-term. And second, in LMR products, strong demand for feature-rich devices continues to drive growth and margin expansion. For example, we have thousands of public safety customers who are on multi-year technology refresh cycles. These customers are increasingly adopting advanced devices like our APX NEXT family of devices. I'll now turn the call back over to Greg.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Jason. And let me just close with a few thoughts. First, our Q2 results highlight the continued momentum we are seeing across the business. We achieved strong revenue growth in all three technologies. We significantly increased operating margins. We grew earnings per share by 22%, and we generated $180 million of operating cash flow. Second, we are continuing to use our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet to create shareholder value and invest for continued growth. Year-to-date, we've spent a little over $700 million to reduce our diluted share count. Inclusive of the Silver Lake convertible note and share repurchases, and we've invested more than $250 million on acquisitions, adding solutions like long-range cameras, vehicle location and critical event management software. We also expect to spend approximately $850 million of R&D this year, focused on expanding our powerful safety and security offerings across the business. And we recently announced the opening of the R&D center in Cork, Ireland, which will focus on designing software for the company's comprehensive land mobile radio portfolio. These investments enhance our powerful ecosystem where video, radio and software work together to improve situational awareness, automate response, and more efficiently manage evidence across the various devices and platforms used by security personnel. And finally, as we enter the second half of the year, I really like how we are positioned. Our solutions have never been more important for customers as they continue to prioritize safety and security. We are seeing increased adoption of our cloud offerings in video and command center, which drove record Q2 backlog in those respective technologies. And we've launched several new products including VESTA NXT, our new cloud-based 9-1-1 call handling solution and our MXP660 TETRA radio, which is the APX NEXT equivalent for the TETRA market, providing both LMR and LTE capabilities in the same device. All of this is driving continued demand and in orders pipeline that's now about $1 billion higher than it was at this point last year, positioning us very well for growth going forward. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim.\nTim Yocum: Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants possibly. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line on how to ask a question.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question is from Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nAlyssa Shreves: Hi. This is actually Alyssa Shreves on for Tim Long. I just wanted to check in given the outperformance we've been seeing in LMR, what inning are we in, in the LMR refresh cycle? We've had two strong quarters on the back of strong quarters from the year prior. Just how should we kind of think about the business moving into 2H? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nGreg Brown: Yes. I think \u2013 look, we're really pleased with the device refresh and the newer portfolio that we continue to release globally. I think when I think of the APX NEXT family of devices, it accounts. We think it will account for less than a quarter of the public safety device shipments this year. So that dimensionalizes kind of the opportunity for that. And by the way, we also, as I mentioned in the remarks, also just announced it's equivalent, the MXP660 for TETRA, which opens up Europe and the international market, and that's a brand-new product, which takes the combination of LMR and LTE capabilities to one device. So I think that is a contributing factor, but the demand for LMR, both product, services, devices, and writ large, the whole technology portfolio remains quite strong.\nJason Winkler: And Alyssa, we mentioned during the call that our outlook for LMR as a whole of the technology this year has gone from mid to mid-to-high. That will include growth in both products for the year as well as software and services, ex-home office. So strong growth drivers across. And within the quarter and within the first half, with the supply chain improvements that we saw, products and LMR products specifically, we were able to attain more supply and lead times improved which in part drove the performance for the first half in LMR products.\nAlyssa Shreves: Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on the video business. Has there been any change in terms of what you've been seeing with customer cadence with customers moving from on-prem to cloud? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: So we talked about a $40 million headwind, Alyssa, this year kind of incorporating the prem to cloud momentum that you just referenced. In Q2, our video software business grew 24%. Cloud and cloud adoption was exponentially higher than that. So quite frankly, it's performing as expected and cloud adoption remains very strong.\nAlyssa Shreves: Great. Thank you so much.\nGreg Brown: Thank you.\nOperator: The next call comes from the line of Matt Niknam at Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatt Niknam: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. First question is on M&A. Greg, I think you've been vocal around, I guess, perhaps an increasing number of opportunities, perhaps more willingness on the part of prospective sellers in the marketplace. You talked about the two deals you've recently done. I'm just curious if you can maybe give us a little bit more of an overview in terms of what you're seeing, the latest out there in the M&A front and potential opportunities. And then secondarily, maybe a follow-up on cash flow. So the guide this year is for about $2.25 billion you've done, I believe, $562 million year-to-date. So can you just talk a little bit about the visibility and confidence in that second half ramp? And I guess, in particular, how we should think about working capital in that context? Thank you.\nGreg Brown: But just on the second one first, we increased our operating cash flow expectations from $2.2 billion to $2.250 billion. I think that's a reflection of the confidence you're asking about in our ability to generate cash flow. Remember also the linearity of the way cash flow is generated by this business overwhelmingly, it's typically back half \u2013 actually even more heavily weighted in Q4. And we expect the linearity of the cash flow generated and the yield associated to be reflective of that as well.\nJason Winkler: Actually, Greg, it's even better linearity this year with our first half. We're strongly ahead of where we were last year as inventory working capital have come down. But you're right, the back half is usually significant cash flow contributors, and we're well on path to the 2.25.\nGreg Brown: On the M&A front, Matt, we like the two acquisitions we made. We like the fact, and you know I think we're pretty good stewards of capital. And we always think about the deployment of capital along a framework of 55%, 25%, 15%. 55% fungible between share repo and opportunistic M&A, 25% dividend, 15% CapEx. That's kind of a reference framework. I do think the M&A funnel, even at this point for us, is quite active. And there's some interesting opportunities. Like anything, we'll see if they materialize, but I like the way the business is performing and the underlying demand drivers organically reflective of the portfolio we have. Equally, I am energized by the opportunity as it presents itself from an M&A funnel standpoint, but we'll see. We certainly have the balance sheet capacity with net debt to net EBITDA of about 1.5, and a recent upgrade to BBB a quarter ago. So I like the firepower we have, but we'll remain very disciplined and focused on how and where we deploy it.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Notter: Hi, thanks very much. I wanted to ask about backlog. I guess trying to better understand how we should think about backlog, Greg. There are puts and takes here. I think you said it was down sequentially, but up year-on-year when we exclude the UK Airwave situation. I think in the year ago quarter, you had some big chunky orders also. There maybe some other puts and takes I'm missing as well. But can you kind of walk me through how we should look at your backlog performance this quarter? Thanks.\nGreg Brown: Sure. So first of all, it's a good question, George. Total backlog is up, as Jason referenced year-over-year when you exclude the home office. That's kind of one reference point. Product backlog, while it deteriorated in Q2, it deteriorated because supply lead times improved really a lot faster than we thought, which informed the 19% print on LMR product growth in Q2. Having said that, product backlog remains pretty healthy at like $4 billion \u2013 actually $4.3 billion off of a record comp the previous year and as a referenced pipeline, the orders pipeline at this point is about $1 billion higher than a year ago, which I think is quite informative as well. Having said all that, you put ingredients all into the blender. We expect total backlog comparable to slightly up off of a record last year. So all in all, I feel pretty good about it. The linearity is a little lumpy and bumpy given the accelerated supply lead times that improved dramatically in Q2. But overall, I feel pretty good.\nJason Winkler: And George, you're right. Last Q2, we did have two significant product-related orders. The combination of Kern County, California, as well as Ukraine order, we're almost $200 million in that quarter, two sizable significant deals in last year's comp.\nGreg Brown: Good point.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. And then I assume really no impact from M&A or FX on backlog?\nGreg Brown: FX was fairly de minimis.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. And then M&A, I assume, also de minimis?\nGreg Brown: Yes, exactly.\nGeorge Notter: Okay. Thank you.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, George.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Joseph Cardoso with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Cardoso: Hey, thanks for the question. I guess just first one for me. Gross margins in the quarter tracked a lot better than what was anticipated. And if I look historically, you've been able to expand margins from 2Q levels through the year. But I guess if my math is right on the guide, it would imply a bit more of a muted cadence than what we've typically seen. Can you maybe just help us understand what is driving that and whether there's anything under the hood in 2Q that we should be appreciating as an outlier? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nJason Winkler: Sure. So within the first half \u2013 at operating margin, I'll start there. We're pleased with our margin performance. We saw good growth on supplier lead times improving pretty significantly during the quarter and really in the first half as well. And we talked about on the call that at operating margin, we'll see 100 bps of expansion on the year, that's up from 75. Within the mix, gross margins will remain comparable, and we'll continue to invest in OpEx whereby now for the year, with the acquisitions that we've announced, our OpEx envelope is expected to be about $130 million more than last year. So good progress on operating margin expansion and healthy gross margins to help drive that.\nJoseph Cardoso: Got it. I appreciate the color there, Jason. And then maybe for my follow-up, and this is a bit of a big picture one, but you talked about the LMR installed base and specifically the opportunity to address more services opportunity there. Curious if you could parcel that out a bit more? And how big of an opportunity that could be for Motorola to better monetize that installed base that you have and how do you see that materializing over time? And maybe just lastly, and maybe this is a silly question, but like is this an area where you could potentially acquire? Or is that just farfetched given your position and or other variables? Thanks for the question guys.\nJack Molloy: Yes. So big picture from a services standpoint, I think we've got growth opportunities in a number of different facets, number one, cyber, our networks, particularly the public safety P25 networks in the United States, Canada and certain countries abroad. We've got opportunities and our customers have asked us to step up in that capacity. The second piece of it is just a scope, just general scope increases across the board globally. The third piece of it is that we manage various networks. We're in discussions right now with two different European countries and a network in South America that we manage for extensions. And to every one of those, it's not apples for apples, it's usually apples plus something. So we're encouraged by the opportunities in front of us from a services standpoint.\nJoseph Cardoso: And then just on potential M&A in the services areas of LMR, is that an opportunity as well? Or is that kind of farfetched?\nGreg Brown: I think it's relatively rare. The last one we did on the services side was TETRA Ireland. We always look for opportunities there. Obviously, that's of interest. That's our power alley and what we do well in provisioning and delivering and own and operating LMR networks. There could be an opportunity or two, but we'll see. But they're more \u2013 they're not typically run rate or every year. They're every few years an opportunity.\nJack Molloy: The only other thing I'd add is just on these managed service networks. We don't typically just look at those through the lens of LMR. Those actually provide us a platform to go and do things like body-worn as a service within national police agencies as well. Text and video contracts that we're looking to start to provide as a service as well. So there's a little bit of a flywheel effect when we get those service opportunities.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Greg, I just wanted to maybe touch on the product revenue growth trajectory from here. If I look at the guidance, obviously, this has been a very, very strong segment for multiple years now. We're going to start getting into the mid to high-single digits in Q4, if my math is right, trying to back into this. And I know that you'll give a greater look into 2025 on the next call typically. But as I kind of try to map out the trajectory of product revenue growth, do you see a scenario where we're potentially going to have more of a soft landing? Or do you think there could be a greater digestion where growth could end up turning negative beyond Q4?\nGreg Brown: Yes. Look, I would say this, kind of stepping back, the demand, the orders pipeline, the backlog, state and local funding, which is good and looks to be good again in 2025, the continued funding environment at the federal level. I mean, Adam, there's a lot of variables here, device refresh systems and services scope. Love the growth, as Jason referenced, we raised it for LMR from mid to mid-to-high that's informing the full-year raise to approximately 8%. And I see continued runway here. Now you're right, we're obviously not going to talk about 2025. Q2 was particularly strong again because component supply drove improved lead times faster than we thought. We still, Adam, expect continued products growth in the second half of the year. So look, I like the way the business is running, but not just for the quarter, I like the momentum we have for the balance of this year, and we'll see what happens next year. But I really like the position we're in. And we'll probably give you some color, high level, on the next quarter as you referenced to inform 2025.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. That's helpful and fair. Maybe just as a follow-up on the increased adoption of cloud in video and command center, and I think we might have Mahesh on the call and in case he wants to weigh in. But I'd be curious what is driving the tipping point to really inflect that adoption now? Also how you would evaluate the competitive environment and Motorola's differentiation in the cloud portion versus the non-cloud portion? And then lastly \u2013 I'm sorry, this is a multi parter. How the financials are impacted in a cloud sale versus a non-cloud sale? Are we in a situation where we might have some cannibalization or change to financials if this happens? Thanks.\nMahesh Saptharishi: Sure, Adam. To begin with, I think one of the reasons why Avigilon has historically been strong is because of we offer an end-to-end solution, which is video plus access control tightly integrated. And that end-to-end solution in many ways, gets amplified with a cloud story. It's one where the installation, the configuration, and the ability to deploy with the least amount of hardware bids on site become that much more attractive. So we see that as one of the reasons why starting with our smaller customers, but now very quickly going into much larger installations as well, we see a preference and a drift towards the cloud. And then on top of that, there are also capabilities AI services and additional capabilities that we're able to deliver via the cloud to augment what we already do at the edge, and that's also a motivator here as well. So that's \u2013 I'd say that's in many ways, one of the things that's driving that \u2013 the cloud growth, which, as Greg already said, while software, video software itself is growing at 24%, cloud software, very specifically actually growing even faster.\nGreg Brown: Yes. And I think that the growth rate \u2013 the strong cloud adoption of what we call Avigilon Alta, which is the cloud version, Avigilon Unity being prem is a reflection of the success of the Openpath acquisition and Ava and the successful integration for combined video and access control under the cloud with Mahesh's leadership and Alex Kazerani. So part of the other \"new infection\" point of our continued growth is the successful not only acquisitions, but the integration and the yield and the benefits associated with our cloud platform. I think the team is doing quite well.\nJack Molloy: The only thing I'd add, Adam, is our Cloud Connector is a differentiator with our customers. It enables our customers to keep their cameras and move to cloud VMS, it's a great point. It's not a closed system. And I think that's a big value proposition differentiator between us and our cloud competition.\nGreg Brown: You're right, Jack.\nMahesh Saptharishi: That's exactly right. I think unlike many of our competitors in this space, our direct-to-cloud cameras are actually standards compliant. And they don't get locked out if that access is not present.\nJason Winkler: Adam, the second question \u2013 part of your question you had to go with the financial model?\nGreg Brown: It was actually the third question, but go ahead.\nJason Winkler: Both on-prem and cloud for us are solid business models. They're value propositions to customers. Of course, we've planned for the $40 million impact of the cloud acceleration that's on track. And both have a good margin structure. And as you know, cloud comes with the stickiness with the term license that upon renewal leads to even greater renewal. So we're pleased with both models.\nAdam Tindle: Greg, you know, I always get my money's worth. Appreciate it.\nGreg Brown: Absolutely, Adam, fire away. No problem.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Bollin: Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Jason, I wanted to go back to the product gross margin. If you exclude mix from the discussion, where would you say you are on the progress with respect to reducing the BOM supply chain efforts, any logistics optimization? What have you seen? What are your thoughts on where you're at and what might be left there?\nJason Winkler: Yes. So we mentioned that supply continues to improve and did so in Q2. If I think about the financial benefits that we are planning for and are showing up, we talked about the year's guide included when we opened in February about having about a $60 million improvement in cost relative to semiconductors and PPV. We're actually on the year basis, probably trending closer to $70 million. And by the way, that benefits is in both first half and second half. So we're seeing the benefit of prices as well as premiums coming down. In terms of product or mix, we continue to see favorable mix. We see volume growth complemented by mix. Both are helpful in terms of the growth drivers you've seen.\nBenjamin Bollin: That\u2019s great. And then last one for me. Greg or Jack, could you remind us on the overall mix of within backlog, what you see from commercial and public safety and how you would \u2013 just remind us on the integrity of those orders versus maybe a more traditionally enterprise-focused order? Thanks.\nJack Molloy: Yes. The backlog composition is almost 95% government direct. Why that's important is our direct sales force, it's a clean line of sight to that backlog, and it's not the channel.\nJason Winkler: And given the funding vehicles and procurements within government, governments order according to their prioritization and they issue a PO to a company like us directly, they don't subsequently order from someone else. And we are fulfilling that backlog. And our backlog, as Jack mentioned, 95% plus comes from our public safety direct customers.\nBenjamin Bollin: Thanks everyone.\nJason Winkler: Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is now open.\nIrvin Liu: Hi. This is actually Irvin Liu on for Amit. And thank you for the question. I wanted to double-click on the international business. I think overall growth in Q2 was mid-single digits, and that was a deceleration versus a quarter ago. And this is all excluding any sort of U.K. Home Office impact. Any sense on how the overall macro and/or demand backdrop for international compares versus North American. In the longer term, should we expect international mix to expand as a percentage of total?\nJack Molloy: Yes. I think we think international is a great opportunity. I mean if you think about it, it's up single digits in Q2 outside of the Home Office. There's really three things, we've got \u2013 within Europe, very large managed and support service business there. We've just announced a new device, as Greg alluded to early being the MXP660, which not only elongates our customers' investment in that managed support service that brings another opportunity from a device standpoint. Australia continues to be a market that we performed quite well. But the other piece, there's two other elements within our video business, we've talked about it before, but mobile video, we compete exceedingly well. Mahesh's team has brought \u2013 recently brought out new device to market another VP device. We talked about Scotland. We've got great opportunities both within the government space, but also in the enterprise space outside of the United States. So international continues to be a great market. We've got great leadership there. And I feel \u2013 I think we all collectively feel really good about opportunities for growth.\nJason Winkler: And I know, Amit, and you and team know this, but just to remind everybody, our international revenues over \u2013 almost 75% of them come from EMEA, Australia and New Zealand. That's our strength. That's where we build networks. That's where we have flywheels of growth, and that \u2013 those are great markets for us for Jack and his team.\nIrvin Liu: Got it. And maybe as a follow-up, I also wanted to just get an update on the U.K. Home Office. I'm not sure if there's anything new to report versus a quarter ago. But can you just walk us through a range of potential outcomes?\nGreg Brown: There's actually one new point from a quarter ago, and that is just \u2013 it's a good question to level set, you know the dispute, it's been ongoing. It's been several years. We believe the CMA ruling was unfounded. We think it's disproportionate. We think it's unprecedented. You've heard us talk about that. We appealed that. We lost. So we appealed to the Competition Appeals Tribunal and we lost. So the only last option as it relates to this dispute, on the imposition of the charge control was the U.K. Court of Appeal, which is their highest court in the U.K. And the noteworthy item is they decided to hear the case. So that's a new development. That hearing is November 11 and 12, impossible to predict what that is, but that is something that's new from when we talked about this a quarter ago. I just want to remind you that as it relates for Q2, the rest of this year, the full-year of this year, we are operating under kind of the draconian disproportionately excessive discount. So that's \u2013 we're raising the full-year inclusive of kind of that worst-case charge control for this year. What happens in the future? Don't know. I am pleased that the U.K. Court of Appeal will give this the appropriate audience and review, and we'll see where it goes from there.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Rodney McFall with North Coast Research. Your line is now open.\nRodney McFall: Hey, everyone. And thanks for taking my question. So I was wondering if you could provide some color on the customer transition to more premium versions of APX NEXT radios. Have they been receptive? And then, just any color on \u2013 in terms of the premium on price compared to legacy versions of the product? Thanks.\nJack Molloy: I guess from an experience standpoint, we've gotten very positive reviews. We've had multiple large-scale police departments that have made the transition to APX NEXT and the APX NEXT family. The first thing is we contemplate one of the things we always think about when we develop product is ease of use. I think we nailed that. The LTE capabilities enable them to get radios programmed and refleeted, I don't want to say instantaneously, but was something that took them weeks and months can now be done in a day, which is a positive thing. It also gives them the capability to extend the network's coverage. And what we've seen is a phenomenon is we've got a lot of customers that have mixed fleets and enables those transitions to happen as well. Last but not least, we talk about our Command Center business, but the APX NEXT and its ability to put through higher bandwidth workflows is also very complementary to our Command Central suite \u2013 our Command Center Suite rather. So we think we've heard really positive things. As Greg and Jason articulated, about 25% of those devices that will ship this year are APX NEXT. So we are in a multiyear phenomenon as it relates to the upgrade.\nRodney McFall: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nLouie DiPalma: Thanks. And Greg, Jason, Jack, Mahesh, and Tim, good afternoon.\nGreg Brown: How are you doing, Louie?\nLouie DiPalma: Great. I'm following up on the several questions regarding the LMR product strength. Should we expect the year-over-year growth rate for the LMR product line to be volatile? Or is this mid-teens level durable. And going deeper, are customers upgrading their radios on the normal six to seven-year upgrade cycle? Or are the features for APX and APX NEXT so compelling that many customers are upgrading early to get the LTE and the programmable devices, which may be driving an acceleration?\nGreg Brown: So a couple of things. Just, Louie, to ground you, the 15% kind of pop the clutch LMR product growth in Q2 was a reflection of lead times, components supply lead times that improved quicker than we thought. So that's why the exceptionally strong 15% print in Q2. Secondly, for the annual year-over-year growth rate, we're saying it's mid to high single digits for LMR. Up from mid, I think that, that improvement is in part because of continued strong traction with devices. I do think \u2013 you're right. I think on average, it's about an 8-year plus or minus device renewal or refresh. I think that's still in the ZIP code as it relates to a North America refresh. But I'll give you an anecdote. I was in a large city last week with a senior commander and spent some time with him, and he had his APX NEXT, I had no idea he would have that. He had his APX NEXT device on his desk when we were talking, I said, what do you think of that? And I know this sounds anecdotal and a self-promotion. It's just \u2013 it's really not. He talked about what Jack referenced, the over-the-air reprogramming, having a control channel that you can hear everything about it, the video display capability, the LTE along with LMR, the adoption rate and the acceptance and the feature functionality that, that device brings, which allows us to price for value is \u2013 has been really, really good. And we're just getting started in the European and international market with the brand-new MXP660, which think of that as the APX NEXT equivalent for Europe and beyond. So I think, look, I love the position we're in. We have thousands of installed networks. We're monetizing the services as Jack talked about, with expanding scope. We're upselling things like cybersecurity. And it's a really good situation. And I think that I like the hand we have.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And in the past, Greg and Jason, you've provided cumulative APX NEXT orders, have you guys passed the $1 billion mark in terms of your cumulative APX NEXT orders?\nGreg Brown: Talking about orders, we used to reference cumulative orders.\nJason Winkler: I think the more important metric that we've shared is that this year, our APX devices total revenues less than a quarter of those will come from the APX NEXT family. So Jack and team are still selling a very good APX radio. Our customers expect it. They don't like forced migrations. They want graceful migrations. And Jack's point about mixed fleets evidence is that. So we have a long way ahead of us. And in the almost $2 billion of devices that will do for public safety, less than 25% of them are going to come this year from APX NEXT.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Maybe as a first question, just in terms of a lot of the acquisitions you've done over the past year, where are you in terms of integration of those acquisitions? Or you kind of integration of those teams in order to kind of get better leverage across the platform or across the customer base? Maybe that's the first question.\nGreg Brown: Yes, I'll let Mahesh since the acquisitions are primarily in video and Command Center, maybe you could speak to the integration progress.\nMahesh Saptharishi: Sure. And maybe just to start out where, Greg, you left off with Alta. So Alta was our brand for Openpath and Ava, which is effectively our cloud-based access control solution and our cloud-based video management solution, both being critical to our portfolio. Both under Alex Kazerani were brought together as Alta. And now we are able to integrate the capabilities of both access control and video I think in fairly unique and powerful ways, ones that our customers are really appreciating and evidenced by the uptake in the market. Beyond that, Rave would be the other big piece here and Rave is one of those critical elements that's a glue between public safety and enterprise security, and Rave integrated not just with 911 and CAD solutions, but also integrated with our enterprise security solutions, effectively video, both Alta and Unity. I think that plays a fairly significant role, and we're seeing that impact of that ecosystem going forward as well. Pelco, we rationalized our video management platforms into one with the on-prem solution being the Unity video management solution. And our camera platforms across all our brands really operate on basically a shared infrastructure with the best of many things that each brand brought into the table, integrated and offered across the board. So I think that speaks to some of the key integration examples. Silent Sentinel is well on its way right now. And as Noggin comes into play here, which has incident management, which is a key piece of the puzzle for us. Noggin will complement both our fixed video portfolio, but it will also complement Rave quite nicely as well.\nGreg Brown: I think just \u2013 the only thing I'd add to that, Meta, the only thing I'd add is, when I think about this company and look back over the last several years, I do think that M&A and successful acquisition financially from an accretion standpoint, and a strategic impact standpoint and our ability to integrate and retain talent. Mahesh is Exhibit A, Alex Kazerani, the CEO of Openpath, Todd Piett, the CEO of Rave, not just retaining them, but having them in contributory senior executive roles that can facilitate and drive integration in addition to the competencies within core Motorola, I'm really pleased. I think it's going quite well.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Maybe piggybacking on that answer. Just how are you guys thinking about capital allocation just given that M&A has been such a successful part of the strategy?\nGreg Brown: Well, we got off to a fast start in the first half of this year with effectively a little over $700 million in share repurchase and the convert on the Silver Lake settlement, which is great. I think the Silver Lake settlement, memory tells me was like $3.18, $3.14 a share. We did $71 million of share repurchases in Q2 at $3.48 and change. So I always like the way we deploy capital, I think, pretty thoughtfully and opportunistically against the discounted share \u2013 the discounted cash flow and the value of the company going forward. And we've now done 40 acquisitions, plus or minus over the last nine or 10 years. We just completed two that we referenced in Q2. And to your point, Meta, the M&A funnel is attractive. So we will be opportunistic along deploying that $2.25 billion of operating cash flow, 55% share repo or acquisitions fungible between the two with 25% dividend, 15% CapEx. So we're well on our way. And I like \u2013 and by the way, I like deploying the capital internally in R&D, too. So $850 million of R&D is giving us the widest and broadest product portfolio through three technologies with land mobile radio, video and Command Center which is, in turn, powering a unique competitive differentiating safety and security ecosystem. So when I think about the deployment of capital organically, I like the returns. When I think about returning it to the shareholder and the value we've created and the float that we've contracted, I like that. And when I look at the opportunities ahead potentially for acquisition, I'm optimistic about some opportunities that may present themselves.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much.\nGreg Brown: Thanks, Meta.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Tomer Zilberman of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nTomer Zilberman: Hey, guys. I wanted to touch on some questions that were asked earlier, but maybe ask them a little bit differently in the video security portfolio, specifically the product portion, you've been growing that roughly mid-single digits over the last few quarters. Are you comfortable with that growth going forward? Or do you expect that to reaccelerate to hit your overall 12% growth for that segment?\nGreg Brown: Well, when I look back at the \u2013 to your point, the previous few quarters, we're in the ZIP code of product video performance. So I like that consistency. The most important is really talking about market share. And we gained market share last year in video security and access control is a category. We expect to gain market share again this year. The fact that the growth rate is much higher in cloud as we signaled earlier, I think, is great. And the product video performance quarter-to-quarter, I think, is fine in the ZIP code and against the backdrop of the overall market growth. So I like where we are, and I like the continued execution.\nJason Winkler: Also, keep in mind, this is an end-to-end systems or solutions business and customers buy the entirety of the portfolio from us products, software, services, and some of the areas we've made investments are in software. So whether it's cloud, whether it's analytics, services and/or mobile video, those are some of the investments we've made. And so to see software growing faster than products is commensurate to that.\nTomer Zilberman: Got it. And maybe as a follow-up, moving to your implied 4Q guidance. So the implied EPS came in a few cents short of Street expectations. Just curious as to your thoughts on the margin set up as we go into the second half of the year, especially 4Q? Thank you.\nJason Winkler: Yes. So with the raise on the year and the higher volumes, offset by a few dilutive cents from the acquisitions we've made the raise is the performance of Q2 as well as the acquisitions, reflecting the 8% total growth.\nGreg Brown: Yes. I mean we passed through the beat in Q2. And obviously, that informs the full year raise pretty nicely. But also there's \u2013 M&A is slightly dilutive of a couple of cents as well, but we like the position we're in.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks.\nGreg Brown: Yes. I just want to say thank you for everybody listening on the call. Obviously, thank you for everybody joining the call. But also thanks for all the Motorola Solutions people and our channel partners and our distributors worldwide appreciate everything you've done for an exceptional quarter. And probably more important than the quarter is the momentum that quarter \u2013 this quarter informs for the back half of the year and how we'd like to finish the year strong. I think our solving for safer narrative continues to resonate and gain traction. I think that's representative in the results. The customer prioritization for putting an emphasis and a priority on safety and security I think, is self-evident. And as I mentioned, the orders pipeline is up pretty significantly from a period ago. At this point last year, referenced about $1 billion. And finally, I think as I've been asked about capital allocation, I like the strength of our balance sheet. I like the fact that our operating cash flow is expected to grow double digits again for the second year in a row. And look, I think the performance of the business, the organic investment, the acquisitions and the firepower of the balance sheet, look, I think it provides us good flexibility to continue to execute and drive shareholder value going forward. And I appreciate everybody on what you're doing and how you're helping onward and upward, and I appreciate everything you've done.\nOperator: This does conclude today's teleconference.

            "name": "Jason Winkler",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 9% and was above our guidance with strong growth in all three technologies. Acquisitions added $13 million, while FX headwinds were $5 million during the quarter. GAAP operating earnings were $644 million or 24.5% of sales, up from 21.6% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $758 million, up 18% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 28.8%, up 210 basis points, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and improved operating leverage partially offset by the Airwave Charge Control. GAAP earnings per share was $2.60, up from $2.15 in the year ago quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.24, up 22% from $2.65 last year. The growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter. OpEx in Q2 was $593 million, up $38 million versus last year, primarily due to higher employee incentives and acquisitions. Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $180 million, up $87 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $112 million, up $72 million. These increases were primarily driven by higher earnings partially offset by higher employee incentives and higher cash taxes. Our year-to-date operating cash flow was $562 million, up from $85 million in the previous year on higher earnings and significantly improved working capital. And we now expect operating cash flow for the full-year to be $2.25 billion, an increase of $50 million versus our prior expectations and double-digit growth expectations over last year. Capital allocation for Q2 included $163 million in cash dividends, $71 million in share repurchases and $68 million of CapEx. Subsequent to the quarter end, we also closed two acquisitions for a total of $223 million. The first is a global provider of critical event management software that expands our command center presence internationally and also complements our Rave acquisition. The second is a provider of vehicle location and management solutions that further builds on our leadership in providing mobile video solutions for the financial services sector. We expect these acquisitions to generate approximately $15 million to $20 million of revenue per quarter primarily in video and to be slightly dilutive to the second half of this year. Moving to segment results in Products and SI, sales were up 15% versus last year, driven by continued demand along with improvements in supply in LMR. Currency headwinds were $2 million in revenue from acquisitions contributed $12 million. Operating earnings were $445 million or 26.8% of sales, up from 19.8%, in the prior year, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q2 wins and achievements in this segment include a $32 million P25 system and device order for the city of Naperville, Illinois, a $19 million P25 system upgrade for Washington County, Virginia, an $18 million P25 system order for a U.S. Federal customer, a $17 million P25 device order for a U.S. customer, an $8 million fixed video order for a large state and local customer and a $6 million video order for Newark Public Schools in New Jersey. In Software and Services, revenue was flat compared to last year, excluding the UK Home Office, revenue was up 11%, driven by strength in all three technologies. Revenue from acquisitions was $1 million in the quarter, and FX headwinds were $3 million. Operating earnings in the segment were $313 million or 32.3% of sales, down from 36.9% last year due to the revenue reduction related to the Airwave Charge Control, which was partially offset by improved operating leverage elsewhere in the segment. Excluding the UK Home Office, software and services operating margins increased during the quarter on higher sales and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q2 highlights in this segment include a $19 million LMR order for the Victorian State Government in Australia, an $18 million LMR order for a U.S. Federal customer, a $12 million Command Center order for the Las Vegas Metro Police Department, an $11 million LMR order for American Airlines. And finally, we received a $16 million mobile video award with Police Scotland. This award was part of a $30 million investment made by Police Scotland to procure body-worn cameras, LMR radios and mobile application software, demonstrating their recognition of the strength of our integrated ecosystem. Looking at regional results. North America Q2 revenue was $1.9 billion, up 17% on growth in all three technologies. International Q2 revenue was $711 million, down 7% versus last year due to the impact of the Airwave Charge Control. Excluding the UK Home Office, international revenue was up mid-single digits with growth in all three technologies. Moving to backlog. Ending total backlog for Q2 was $14 billion, a decrease of approximately $300 million or 2% versus last year. Excluding the UK Home Office, total backlog was $12.5 billion, up from $12.4 billion last year. In the Products and SI segment ending backlog decreased $482 million versus last year and $308 million sequentially, driven by strong LMR shipments as supplier lead time improvements enabled us to ship additional products earlier in the year and improve our sales linearity. In software and services backlog increased $164 million compared to last year, driven by multi-year software and services contracts across all three technologies, partially offset by 12 months of revenue recognition from the UK Home Office. Sequentially, backlog was down $129 million, primarily driven by the quarterly revenue recognition for the UK home office. Turning next to our outlook. We expect Q3 sales growth between 7% and 8%, with non-GAAP earnings per share between $3.32 and $3.37 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 170 million shares and an effective tax rate of 24%. For the full-year, we are again increasing both our revenue and earnings per share guidance. We now expect revenue growth of approximately 8%, up from our prior guidance of approximately 7%, and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $13.22 and $13.30 per share, up from our prior guide of $12.98 to $13.08 per share. The full-year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 171 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5%. It also assumes operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points, up from our prior expectation of 75 basis points, driven by higher sales. And finally, before turning the call back to Greg, I wanted to share some insights regarding our increased expectations for the year. In video, we now expect approximately 12% of growth for the full-year, inclusive of the recent M&A. Video continues to be an exciting opportunity for us with new products like ACC 8 video management system, H6 cameras, our latest AI-enabled video recorder and both cloud and on-premises offers. And for LMR, we are increasing our expectations to mid to high single-digit growth for the full-year, which includes the headwinds related to the UK Home Office that we communicated at the beginning of the year. On the continued strength of LMR, I'd point to a couple of important drivers. First, in LMR services, we have a significant installed base, and our customers are increasingly relying on our expanded services offerings such as cyber and software upgrade agreements as they continue to invest in their networks for the long-term. And second, in LMR products, strong demand for feature-rich devices continues to drive growth and margin expansion. For example, we have thousands of public safety customers who are on multi-year technology refresh cycles. These customers are increasingly adopting advanced devices like our APX NEXT family of devices. I'll now turn the call back over to Greg. And Alyssa, we mentioned during the call that our outlook for LMR as a whole of the technology this year has gone from mid to mid-to-high. That will include growth in both products for the year as well as software and services, ex-home office. So strong growth drivers across. And within the quarter and within the first half, with the supply chain improvements that we saw, products and LMR products specifically, we were able to attain more supply and lead times improved which in part drove the performance for the first half in LMR products. Actually, Greg, it's even better linearity this year with our first half. We're strongly ahead of where we were last year as inventory working capital have come down. But you're right, the back half is usually significant cash flow contributors, and we're well on path to the 2.25. And George, you're right. Last Q2, we did have two significant product-related orders. The combination of Kern County, California, as well as Ukraine order, we're almost $200 million in that quarter, two sizable significant deals in last year's comp. Sure. So within the first half \u2013 at operating margin, I'll start there. We're pleased with our margin performance. We saw good growth on supplier lead times improving pretty significantly during the quarter and really in the first half as well. And we talked about on the call that at operating margin, we'll see 100 bps of expansion on the year, that's up from 75. Within the mix, gross margins will remain comparable, and we'll continue to invest in OpEx whereby now for the year, with the acquisitions that we've announced, our OpEx envelope is expected to be about $130 million more than last year. So good progress on operating margin expansion and healthy gross margins to help drive that. Adam, the second question \u2013 part of your question you had to go with the financial model? Both on-prem and cloud for us are solid business models. They're value propositions to customers. Of course, we've planned for the $40 million impact of the cloud acceleration that's on track. And both have a good margin structure. And as you know, cloud comes with the stickiness with the term license that upon renewal leads to even greater renewal. So we're pleased with both models. Yes. So we mentioned that supply continues to improve and did so in Q2. If I think about the financial benefits that we are planning for and are showing up, we talked about the year's guide included when we opened in February about having about a $60 million improvement in cost relative to semiconductors and PPV. We're actually on the year basis, probably trending closer to $70 million. And by the way, that benefits is in both first half and second half. So we're seeing the benefit of prices as well as premiums coming down. In terms of product or mix, we continue to see favorable mix. We see volume growth complemented by mix. Both are helpful in terms of the growth drivers you've seen. And given the funding vehicles and procurements within government, governments order according to their prioritization and they issue a PO to a company like us directly, they don't subsequently order from someone else. And we are fulfilling that backlog. And our backlog, as Jack mentioned, 95% plus comes from our public safety direct customers. Thanks, Ben. And I know, Amit, and you and team know this, but just to remind everybody, our international revenues over \u2013 almost 75% of them come from EMEA, Australia and New Zealand. That's our strength. That's where we build networks. That's where we have flywheels of growth, and that \u2013 those are great markets for us for Jack and his team. I think the more important metric that we've shared is that this year, our APX devices total revenues less than a quarter of those will come from the APX NEXT family. So Jack and team are still selling a very good APX radio. Our customers expect it. They don't like forced migrations. They want graceful migrations. And Jack's point about mixed fleets evidence is that. So we have a long way ahead of us. And in the almost $2 billion of devices that will do for public safety, less than 25% of them are going to come this year from APX NEXT. Also, keep in mind, this is an end-to-end systems or solutions business and customers buy the entirety of the portfolio from us products, software, services, and some of the areas we've made investments are in software. So whether it's cloud, whether it's analytics, services and/or mobile video, those are some of the investments we've made. And so to see software growing faster than products is commensurate to that. Yes. So with the raise on the year and the higher volumes, offset by a few dilutive cents from the acquisitions we've made the raise is the performance of Q2 as well as the acquisitions, reflecting the 8% total growth."

            "name": "Mahesh Saptharishi",
            "content": "Sure, Adam. To begin with, I think one of the reasons why Avigilon has historically been strong is because of we offer an end-to-end solution, which is video plus access control tightly integrated. And that end-to-end solution in many ways, gets amplified with a cloud story. It's one where the installation, the configuration, and the ability to deploy with the least amount of hardware bids on site become that much more attractive. So we see that as one of the reasons why starting with our smaller customers, but now very quickly going into much larger installations as well, we see a preference and a drift towards the cloud. And then on top of that, there are also capabilities AI services and additional capabilities that we're able to deliver via the cloud to augment what we already do at the edge, and that's also a motivator here as well. So that's \u2013 I'd say that's in many ways, one of the things that's driving that \u2013 the cloud growth, which, as Greg already said, while software, video software itself is growing at 24%, cloud software, very specifically actually growing even faster. That's exactly right. I think unlike many of our competitors in this space, our direct-to-cloud cameras are actually standards compliant. And they don't get locked out if that access is not present. Sure. And maybe just to start out where, Greg, you left off with Alta. So Alta was our brand for Openpath and Ava, which is effectively our cloud-based access control solution and our cloud-based video management solution, both being critical to our portfolio. Both under Alex Kazerani were brought together as Alta. And now we are able to integrate the capabilities of both access control and video I think in fairly unique and powerful ways, ones that our customers are really appreciating and evidenced by the uptake in the market. Beyond that, Rave would be the other big piece here and Rave is one of those critical elements that's a glue between public safety and enterprise security, and Rave integrated not just with 911 and CAD solutions, but also integrated with our enterprise security solutions, effectively video, both Alta and Unity. I think that plays a fairly significant role, and we're seeing that impact of that ecosystem going forward as well. Pelco, we rationalized our video management platforms into one with the on-prem solution being the Unity video management solution. And our camera platforms across all our brands really operate on basically a shared infrastructure with the best of many things that each brand brought into the table, integrated and offered across the board. So I think that speaks to some of the key integration examples. Silent Sentinel is well on its way right now. And as Noggin comes into play here, which has incident management, which is a key piece of the puzzle for us. Noggin will complement both our fixed video portfolio, but it will also complement Rave quite nicely as well."

            "name": "Greg Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and outlook. First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter with record Q2 revenue and operating earnings. Products and SI revenue was up 15% and operating earnings were up 56%, driven by continued strong demand and favorable mix within LMR products. In Software and Services, revenue was flat, excluding the home office, from the UK, revenue was up 11%, driven by strength in all three technologies. And we also increased earnings per share by 22%, generated $180 million of operating cash flow and ended the quarter with $14 billion of backlog, positioning us well for our continued growth. Second, I'm encouraged by the continued momentum we are seeing across the business. In Video Security, revenue was up 10%, driven by growth in both our fixed and mobile video solutions and increasing in software and services. In Command Center, revenue increased 9%, as customers continue to adopt our solutions that help them effectively accelerate response and resolution of incidence. And in LMR, revenue increased 9%, inclusive of the UK Home Office headwinds driven by LMR products as well as Managed and Support Services. And finally, based on our Q2 results, robust demand and continued prioritization for safety and security by our customers, we are again raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full-year. I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Thanks, Jason. And let me just close with a few thoughts. First, our Q2 results highlight the continued momentum we are seeing across the business. We achieved strong revenue growth in all three technologies. We significantly increased operating margins. We grew earnings per share by 22%, and we generated $180 million of operating cash flow. Second, we are continuing to use our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet to create shareholder value and invest for continued growth. Year-to-date, we've spent a little over $700 million to reduce our diluted share count. Inclusive of the Silver Lake convertible note and share repurchases, and we've invested more than $250 million on acquisitions, adding solutions like long-range cameras, vehicle location and critical event management software. We also expect to spend approximately $850 million of R&D this year, focused on expanding our powerful safety and security offerings across the business. And we recently announced the opening of the R&D center in Cork, Ireland, which will focus on designing software for the company's comprehensive land mobile radio portfolio. These investments enhance our powerful ecosystem where video, radio and software work together to improve situational awareness, automate response, and more efficiently manage evidence across the various devices and platforms used by security personnel. And finally, as we enter the second half of the year, I really like how we are positioned. Our solutions have never been more important for customers as they continue to prioritize safety and security. We are seeing increased adoption of our cloud offerings in video and command center, which drove record Q2 backlog in those respective technologies. And we've launched several new products including VESTA NXT, our new cloud-based 9-1-1 call handling solution and our MXP660 TETRA radio, which is the APX NEXT equivalent for the TETRA market, providing both LMR and LTE capabilities in the same device. All of this is driving continued demand and in orders pipeline that's now about $1 billion higher than it was at this point last year, positioning us very well for growth going forward. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Yes. I think \u2013 look, we're really pleased with the device refresh and the newer portfolio that we continue to release globally. I think when I think of the APX NEXT family of devices, it accounts. We think it will account for less than a quarter of the public safety device shipments this year. So that dimensionalizes kind of the opportunity for that. And by the way, we also, as I mentioned in the remarks, also just announced it's equivalent, the MXP660 for TETRA, which opens up Europe and the international market, and that's a brand-new product, which takes the combination of LMR and LTE capabilities to one device. So I think that is a contributing factor, but the demand for LMR, both product, services, devices, and writ large, the whole technology portfolio remains quite strong. So we talked about a $40 million headwind, Alyssa, this year kind of incorporating the prem to cloud momentum that you just referenced. In Q2, our video software business grew 24%. Cloud and cloud adoption was exponentially higher than that. So quite frankly, it's performing as expected and cloud adoption remains very strong. Thank you. But just on the second one first, we increased our operating cash flow expectations from $2.2 billion to $2.250 billion. I think that's a reflection of the confidence you're asking about in our ability to generate cash flow. Remember also the linearity of the way cash flow is generated by this business overwhelmingly, it's typically back half \u2013 actually even more heavily weighted in Q4. And we expect the linearity of the cash flow generated and the yield associated to be reflective of that as well. On the M&A front, Matt, we like the two acquisitions we made. We like the fact, and you know I think we're pretty good stewards of capital. And we always think about the deployment of capital along a framework of 55%, 25%, 15%. 55% fungible between share repo and opportunistic M&A, 25% dividend, 15% CapEx. That's kind of a reference framework. I do think the M&A funnel, even at this point for us, is quite active. And there's some interesting opportunities. Like anything, we'll see if they materialize, but I like the way the business is performing and the underlying demand drivers organically reflective of the portfolio we have. Equally, I am energized by the opportunity as it presents itself from an M&A funnel standpoint, but we'll see. We certainly have the balance sheet capacity with net debt to net EBITDA of about 1.5, and a recent upgrade to BBB a quarter ago. So I like the firepower we have, but we'll remain very disciplined and focused on how and where we deploy it. Sure. So first of all, it's a good question, George. Total backlog is up, as Jason referenced year-over-year when you exclude the home office. That's kind of one reference point. Product backlog, while it deteriorated in Q2, it deteriorated because supply lead times improved really a lot faster than we thought, which informed the 19% print on LMR product growth in Q2. Having said that, product backlog remains pretty healthy at like $4 billion \u2013 actually $4.3 billion off of a record comp the previous year and as a referenced pipeline, the orders pipeline at this point is about $1 billion higher than a year ago, which I think is quite informative as well. Having said all that, you put ingredients all into the blender. We expect total backlog comparable to slightly up off of a record last year. So all in all, I feel pretty good about it. The linearity is a little lumpy and bumpy given the accelerated supply lead times that improved dramatically in Q2. But overall, I feel pretty good. Good point. FX was fairly de minimis. Yes, exactly. Thanks, George. I think it's relatively rare. The last one we did on the services side was TETRA Ireland. We always look for opportunities there. Obviously, that's of interest. That's our power alley and what we do well in provisioning and delivering and own and operating LMR networks. There could be an opportunity or two, but we'll see. But they're more \u2013 they're not typically run rate or every year. They're every few years an opportunity. Yes. Look, I would say this, kind of stepping back, the demand, the orders pipeline, the backlog, state and local funding, which is good and looks to be good again in 2025, the continued funding environment at the federal level. I mean, Adam, there's a lot of variables here, device refresh systems and services scope. Love the growth, as Jason referenced, we raised it for LMR from mid to mid-to-high that's informing the full-year raise to approximately 8%. And I see continued runway here. Now you're right, we're obviously not going to talk about 2025. Q2 was particularly strong again because component supply drove improved lead times faster than we thought. We still, Adam, expect continued products growth in the second half of the year. So look, I like the way the business is running, but not just for the quarter, I like the momentum we have for the balance of this year, and we'll see what happens next year. But I really like the position we're in. And we'll probably give you some color, high level, on the next quarter as you referenced to inform 2025. Yes. And I think that the growth rate \u2013 the strong cloud adoption of what we call Avigilon Alta, which is the cloud version, Avigilon Unity being prem is a reflection of the success of the Openpath acquisition and Ava and the successful integration for combined video and access control under the cloud with Mahesh's leadership and Alex Kazerani. So part of the other \"new infection\" point of our continued growth is the successful not only acquisitions, but the integration and the yield and the benefits associated with our cloud platform. I think the team is doing quite well. You're right, Jack. It was actually the third question, but go ahead. Absolutely, Adam, fire away. No problem. There's actually one new point from a quarter ago, and that is just \u2013 it's a good question to level set, you know the dispute, it's been ongoing. It's been several years. We believe the CMA ruling was unfounded. We think it's disproportionate. We think it's unprecedented. You've heard us talk about that. We appealed that. We lost. So we appealed to the Competition Appeals Tribunal and we lost. So the only last option as it relates to this dispute, on the imposition of the charge control was the U.K. Court of Appeal, which is their highest court in the U.K. And the noteworthy item is they decided to hear the case. So that's a new development. That hearing is November 11 and 12, impossible to predict what that is, but that is something that's new from when we talked about this a quarter ago. I just want to remind you that as it relates for Q2, the rest of this year, the full-year of this year, we are operating under kind of the draconian disproportionately excessive discount. So that's \u2013 we're raising the full-year inclusive of kind of that worst-case charge control for this year. What happens in the future? Don't know. I am pleased that the U.K. Court of Appeal will give this the appropriate audience and review, and we'll see where it goes from there. How are you doing, Louie? So a couple of things. Just, Louie, to ground you, the 15% kind of pop the clutch LMR product growth in Q2 was a reflection of lead times, components supply lead times that improved quicker than we thought. So that's why the exceptionally strong 15% print in Q2. Secondly, for the annual year-over-year growth rate, we're saying it's mid to high single digits for LMR. Up from mid, I think that, that improvement is in part because of continued strong traction with devices. I do think \u2013 you're right. I think on average, it's about an 8-year plus or minus device renewal or refresh. I think that's still in the ZIP code as it relates to a North America refresh. But I'll give you an anecdote. I was in a large city last week with a senior commander and spent some time with him, and he had his APX NEXT, I had no idea he would have that. He had his APX NEXT device on his desk when we were talking, I said, what do you think of that? And I know this sounds anecdotal and a self-promotion. It's just \u2013 it's really not. He talked about what Jack referenced, the over-the-air reprogramming, having a control channel that you can hear everything about it, the video display capability, the LTE along with LMR, the adoption rate and the acceptance and the feature functionality that, that device brings, which allows us to price for value is \u2013 has been really, really good. And we're just getting started in the European and international market with the brand-new MXP660, which think of that as the APX NEXT equivalent for Europe and beyond. So I think, look, I love the position we're in. We have thousands of installed networks. We're monetizing the services as Jack talked about, with expanding scope. We're upselling things like cybersecurity. And it's a really good situation. And I think that I like the hand we have. Talking about orders, we used to reference cumulative orders. Yes, I'll let Mahesh since the acquisitions are primarily in video and Command Center, maybe you could speak to the integration progress. I think just \u2013 the only thing I'd add to that, Meta, the only thing I'd add is, when I think about this company and look back over the last several years, I do think that M&A and successful acquisition financially from an accretion standpoint, and a strategic impact standpoint and our ability to integrate and retain talent. Mahesh is Exhibit A, Alex Kazerani, the CEO of Openpath, Todd Piett, the CEO of Rave, not just retaining them, but having them in contributory senior executive roles that can facilitate and drive integration in addition to the competencies within core Motorola, I'm really pleased. I think it's going quite well. Well, we got off to a fast start in the first half of this year with effectively a little over $700 million in share repurchase and the convert on the Silver Lake settlement, which is great. I think the Silver Lake settlement, memory tells me was like $3.18, $3.14 a share. We did $71 million of share repurchases in Q2 at $3.48 and change. So I always like the way we deploy capital, I think, pretty thoughtfully and opportunistically against the discounted share \u2013 the discounted cash flow and the value of the company going forward. And we've now done 40 acquisitions, plus or minus over the last nine or 10 years. We just completed two that we referenced in Q2. And to your point, Meta, the M&A funnel is attractive. So we will be opportunistic along deploying that $2.25 billion of operating cash flow, 55% share repo or acquisitions fungible between the two with 25% dividend, 15% CapEx. So we're well on our way. And I like \u2013 and by the way, I like deploying the capital internally in R&D, too. So $850 million of R&D is giving us the widest and broadest product portfolio through three technologies with land mobile radio, video and Command Center which is, in turn, powering a unique competitive differentiating safety and security ecosystem. So when I think about the deployment of capital organically, I like the returns. When I think about returning it to the shareholder and the value we've created and the float that we've contracted, I like that. And when I look at the opportunities ahead potentially for acquisition, I'm optimistic about some opportunities that may present themselves. Thanks, Meta. Well, when I look back at the \u2013 to your point, the previous few quarters, we're in the ZIP code of product video performance. So I like that consistency. The most important is really talking about market share. And we gained market share last year in video security and access control is a category. We expect to gain market share again this year. The fact that the growth rate is much higher in cloud as we signaled earlier, I think, is great. And the product video performance quarter-to-quarter, I think, is fine in the ZIP code and against the backdrop of the overall market growth. So I like where we are, and I like the continued execution. Yes. I mean we passed through the beat in Q2. And obviously, that informs the full year raise pretty nicely. But also there's \u2013 M&A is slightly dilutive of a couple of cents as well, but we like the position we're in. Yes. I just want to say thank you for everybody listening on the call. Obviously, thank you for everybody joining the call. But also thanks for all the Motorola Solutions people and our channel partners and our distributors worldwide appreciate everything you've done for an exceptional quarter. And probably more important than the quarter is the momentum that quarter \u2013 this quarter informs for the back half of the year and how we'd like to finish the year strong. I think our solving for safer narrative continues to resonate and gain traction. I think that's representative in the results. The customer prioritization for putting an emphasis and a priority on safety and security I think, is self-evident. And as I mentioned, the orders pipeline is up pretty significantly from a period ago. At this point last year, referenced about $1 billion. And finally, I think as I've been asked about capital allocation, I like the strength of our balance sheet. I like the fact that our operating cash flow is expected to grow double digits again for the second year in a row. And look, I think the performance of the business, the organic investment, the acquisitions and the firepower of the balance sheet, look, I think it provides us good flexibility to continue to execute and drive shareholder value going forward. And I appreciate everybody on what you're doing and how you're helping onward and upward, and I appreciate everything you've done."

            "content": "Yes. So big picture from a services standpoint, I think we've got growth opportunities in a number of different facets, number one, cyber, our networks, particularly the public safety P25 networks in the United States, Canada and certain countries abroad. We've got opportunities and our customers have asked us to step up in that capacity. The second piece of it is just a scope, just general scope increases across the board globally. The third piece of it is that we manage various networks. We're in discussions right now with two different European countries and a network in South America that we manage for extensions. And to every one of those, it's not apples for apples, it's usually apples plus something. So we're encouraged by the opportunities in front of us from a services standpoint. The only other thing I'd add is just on these managed service networks. We don't typically just look at those through the lens of LMR. Those actually provide us a platform to go and do things like body-worn as a service within national police agencies as well. Text and video contracts that we're looking to start to provide as a service as well. So there's a little bit of a flywheel effect when we get those service opportunities. The only thing I'd add, Adam, is our Cloud Connector is a differentiator with our customers. It enables our customers to keep their cameras and move to cloud VMS, it's a great point. It's not a closed system. And I think that's a big value proposition differentiator between us and our cloud competition. Yes. The backlog composition is almost 95% government direct. Why that's important is our direct sales force, it's a clean line of sight to that backlog, and it's not the channel. Yes. I think we think international is a great opportunity. I mean if you think about it, it's up single digits in Q2 outside of the Home Office. There's really three things, we've got \u2013 within Europe, very large managed and support service business there. We've just announced a new device, as Greg alluded to early being the MXP660, which not only elongates our customers' investment in that managed support service that brings another opportunity from a device standpoint. Australia continues to be a market that we performed quite well. But the other piece, there's two other elements within our video business, we've talked about it before, but mobile video, we compete exceedingly well. Mahesh's team has brought \u2013 recently brought out new device to market another VP device. We talked about Scotland. We've got great opportunities both within the government space, but also in the enterprise space outside of the United States. So international continues to be a great market. We've got great leadership there. And I feel \u2013 I think we all collectively feel really good about opportunities for growth. I guess from an experience standpoint, we've gotten very positive reviews. We've had multiple large-scale police departments that have made the transition to APX NEXT and the APX NEXT family. The first thing is we contemplate one of the things we always think about when we develop product is ease of use. I think we nailed that. The LTE capabilities enable them to get radios programmed and refleeted, I don't want to say instantaneously, but was something that took them weeks and months can now be done in a day, which is a positive thing. It also gives them the capability to extend the network's coverage. And what we've seen is a phenomenon is we've got a lot of customers that have mixed fleets and enables those transitions to happen as well. Last but not least, we talk about our Command Center business, but the APX NEXT and its ability to put through higher bandwidth workflows is also very complementary to our Command Central suite \u2013 our Command Center Suite rather. So we think we've heard really positive things. As Greg and Jason articulated, about 25% of those devices that will ship this year are APX NEXT. So we are in a multiyear phenomenon as it relates to the upgrade."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. The presentation material and additional financial tables are posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a webcast replay of this call will be available on our website within 3 hours after the conclusion of this call. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. [Operator Instructions].  \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Yocum, you may begin your conference. \nTim Yocum: Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Jason Winkler, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President and COO; and Mahesh Saptharishi, Executive Vice President and CTO.  \n Greg and Jason will review our results along with commentary, and Jack and Mahesh will join for Q&A. We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. During the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. \n A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K or any quarterly report on Form 10-Q and any our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.  \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg. \nGregory Brown: Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and outlook. First, Q1 was an outstanding start to the year. We achieved revenue growth of 10%, earnings per share growth of 27%, expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and generated record Q1 operating cash flow of $382 million. We also finished the quarter with $14.4 billion of backlog, up $300 million versus last year. \n Second, our outstanding Q1 performance was broad-based. In our Products and SI segment, revenue was up 14% and operating margins increased 590 basis points as we continue to see strong demand for our feature-rich LMR products, including APX NEXT and our refreshed PCR portfolio. In Software and Services revenue was up 4%, inclusive of the Airwave of charge control and our exit from the ESN contract. \n Excluding U.K. home office revenues, Software and Services revenues increased double digits, driven by continued strong demand for our LMR service offerings and our software applications in Video Security and Command Center. And finally, based on our strong start to the year and continued robust demand, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year.  \n I'll now turn the call over to Jason. \nJason Winkler: Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 10% and was above our guidance with strong growth in all three technologies. GAAP operating earnings were $519 million or 21.7% of sales, up from 18.4% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $638 million, up 20% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%, up 220 basis points. \n The strong year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales a favorable mix shift as our customers invest in more feature-rich LMR products and improved operating leverage, offset by the U.K. CMA charge control related to Airwave. GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.23 and included a $585 million charge, resulting in a $3.42 per share pretax nonoperating loss due to the accounting treatment for the settlement of the Silver Lake convertible notes.  \n We settled these notes entirely in cash for approximately $1.59 billion inclusive of the conversion premium, which eliminated potential dilution to our share count and reflected a favorable negotiated settlement price compared to the indenture terms. As a result, we recognized a nonoperating loss for the settlement during the quarter. According to the current accounting rules for convertible notes, which were updated in 2022. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.81, up 27% from $2.22 last year. This strong growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins, lower interest cost and a lower diluted share count. OpEx in Q1 was $568 million, up $38 million versus last year, primarily due to higher employee incentives and acquisitions.  \n Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow was a Q1 record of $382 million, up $390 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $336 million, up $398 million. The strong increase in cash flow was driven by improved working capital and higher earnings net of noncash charges. Capital allocation for Q1 included $163 million in cash dividends $46 million of CapEx and $39 million of share repurchases. We also used $593 million of cash to settle the Silver Lake conversion premium and we closed the acquisition of Silent Sentinel, a provider of specialized long-range cameras for $37 million net of cash required.  \n Moving to segment results. In Products and SI, sales were up 14% versus last year, driven by continued strong demand, combined with improved supply availability and a favorable mix shift in LMR products. Operating earnings were $370 million or 24.8% of sales, up from 18.9% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment include a $22 million P25 device order for a large U.S. customer, a $16 million LMR order for an international customer, a $13 million order for the State of Tennessee and a $13 million mobile video order for North Carolina State Highway Patrol.  \n In Software and Services, revenue was up 4% compared to last year. S&S revenues, excluding the U.K. home office were up 12%, driven by strong growth in all three technologies. Operating earnings in the segment were $268 million or 29.8% of sales down from the 32.9% of sales last year due to the impact of the Airwave charge control. Excluding the impact of the U.K. Airwave charge control, Software and Services margins increased year-over-year, driven primarily by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q1 highlights in this segment include a $25 million LMR services order for Douglas County, Colorado, a $25 million LMR services order for U.K. Department of Health, an $18 million Command Center order for the city of San Francisco, a $14 million LMR services order for Lithuania and an $11 million services order for S\u00e3o Paulo State Police in Brazil.  \n Moving next to our regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.7 billion, up 13% on strong double-digit growth in both segments. International Q1 revenue was $696 million, up 3% versus last year with growth in video and LMR, offset by lower U.K. home office revenues related to the U.K. home office Airwave charge control and our exit of ESN. International revenue, excluding the U.K. home office impact increased double digits year-over-year in both segments.  \n Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a record $14.4 billion, up $331 million versus last year, driven primarily by strong demand for multiyear Software and Services contracts in both regions. The year-over-year increase is inclusive of the reduction of $777 million booked in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the Airwave charge control and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN over the last year. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a $748 million of backlog related to the receipt of a 3-year extension notice from the U.K. home office for years 2027 through 2029.  \n Our total backlog, excluding the U.K. Home Office was up over $500 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $138 million, driven by the extension notice related to Airwave that I just mentioned, partially offset by our typical Q4 to Q1 order seasonality in North America and some favorable -- unfavorable FX. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was down $74 million, primarily due to unfavorable FX. Sequentially, backlog was down $354 million due to the Q4 to Q1 North America order seasonality that I mentioned.  \n And then Software and Services backlog was up $404 million compared to last year, driven by strong demand for multiyear services contracts in both regions. Our S&S backlog, excluding the U.K. Home Office was up almost $600 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $492 million, driven primarily by the extension notice related to Airwave, partially offset by Q4 to Q1 order seasonality.  \n Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up between 7% and 8% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.97 and $3.02 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 170 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. And for the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. \n We now expect revenue growth of approximately 7%, up from our prior guidance of approximately 6%. And with that, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.98 and $13.08 per share, up from our prior guidance of $12.62 to $12.72 per share. In addition, with the U.S. dollar strengthening since our last call, this full year outlook now assumes an FX headwind of $30 million, primarily in the second half. It also includes a weighted average diluted share count between 170 million and 171 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. And finally, as a result of the debt issuance and Silver Lake settlement we completed in Q1 and we now expect full year interest expense to be approximately $240 million, up $25 million year-over-year.  \n Before turning the call back to Greg, I want to highlight, just a couple of balance sheet-related items. During the quarter, we used $593 million to settle in cash the premium for the Silver Lake notes that I mentioned. We also repurchased 39 million of shares, resulting together in a combined total of $632 million targeted at reducing our diluted share count. \n Also during the quarter, both S&P and Fitch upgraded our credit ratings to BBB underlying the strength of our business and the balance sheet. Following the upgrades, we issued $1.3 billion of debt, $900 million of 10-year and $400 million of 5-year notes, further extending our average debt maturity, which is now over 8 years, all fixed at an average rate below 4.5%. We used a portion of the proceeds from the new debt issuance to pay off the $1 billion convertible notes and plan to use the remainder to settle the approximately $300 million of debt maturity coming due later this year.  \n I'll now turn the call back to Greg. \nGregory Brown: Thanks, Jason. And let me just close with a few thoughts. First, Q1 was outstanding across the Board. We achieved strong revenue growth in all three technologies. We significantly increased operating margins. We generated record Q1 operating backlog -- operating cash flow and our strong ending backlog positions us well going forward. As a result, we're raising our expectations for both revenue and earnings for the full year. \n Second, during the quarter, we announced that we mutually agreed with Silver Lake to settle the convertible notes. Silver Lake has been a great partner since their initial investment in 2015, and I'm very pleased that Greg Mondre is remaining on our Board. And finally, as I look forward, I'm exceptionally pleased with how well we're positioned. \n The investments we've made in our LMR product portfolio are driving meaningful revenue growth and margin expansion. Our recurring revenues are increasing as a result of the continued strong demand for our services. We continue to see accelerated adoption of our cloud offerings, including Rave and Command Center and Avigilon Alta in Video Security and our strong balance sheet positions us well to invest both organically and inorganically for continued growth. \n We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, still expect to generate $2.2 billion of operating cash flow for the year. We refinanced and extended a portion of our debt portfolio, and we received upgrades from two credit rating agencies during the quarter. All of this provides us with significant continued flexibility in how we deploy capital going forward. \n I'll now turn the call over to Tim and look forward to your questions. \nTim Yocum: Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Tim Long with Barclays. \nTimothy Long: Maybe the first question would be on video, and then I have a follow-up on LMR. The video side, decent growth in the quarter. I'm just hoping you could talk about a few things there. First, where are we with impact of movements to cloud and what effect that had on the quarter? \n And the second piece, Jason, it looks like a very high if you're looking at the software services percentage of the Video business, it was over 40%. So just curious if we're starting to see an inflection there? Or was it just an anomaly because maybe the hardware piece was a little bit lower this quarter. Then I'll -- after that, I'll follow back with the LMR follow-up. \nGregory Brown: Yes. Tim, on Video, pleased with the results in Q1. As you know, we remain convicted around the 10% for the full year. We did talk about last quarter that we are seeing an increased adoption to Avigilon Alta and cloud adoption. We talked last quarter and it remains unchanged. That's probably about -- probably a $40 million estimated headwind in terms of the top line growth number that informs the 10% but feel very good about Q1's performance. And by the way, in particular, the orders for video were strong, both in fixed and mobile. \nJason Winkler: And Tim, on the second part of your question, you're right, software within video is growing faster than the product side. That's a trend we've been seeing. And keep in mind, it's not just Alta, it's all of the exciting developments that we have around analytics. Both of our VMSs, our software products are recorded there. Mobile video is also there, all complemented by cloud subscription. So that's a very important and fast-growing part of our business. Now the LMR piece. \nTimothy Long: And then maybe second -- yes. Just on LMR, Greg, you talked about a lot of the investments there. And obviously, it's bearing fruit and other growth rate above expectations. Can you just talk about kind of where we are in the cycle there? That would be great. \nGregory Brown: Yes. I think -- look, I can't be more pleased with the performance of LMR products and services. And Jack talked about the continued strong demand last quarter, it's the same as this quarter. In terms of APX NEXT, as an example, a lot of customers are indexing and in Q1 indexed to more feature-rich devices which helped drive revenue and quite frankly, Tim, margin expansion. \n But I'd actually -- I think the way to think about LMR growth is APX writ large, the entire segment for APX Radio. They're newer. They've been upgraded. We talk about APX NEXT, which is the very high end, but the whole portfolio which we also talk about APX Originals performing exceptionally well. And then when you go over to TETRA and PCR, where we've refreshed devices there as well, that's gone very well. In fact, PCR, we now expect to grow slightly up off of record levels last year. So I'd say we're still in the middle of the game on device refresh with a lot more to run. Really pleased on that front. \nJohn Molloy: The only thing Tim I'd add on top of that is, as just Greg pointed out, it's the breadth of the portfolio is a strength. But what's particularly driving the APX NEXT adoption are the applications. So in the quarter, in Q1, we secured two large state patrols as well as one Department of Transportation, as you think about what drives those, it's location. It's the ability to extend the network vis-a-vis SmartConnect and SmartProgramming with large fleets, their ability to reprogram and the like in a more expeditious fashion, so. \nJason Winkler: Jack, you've seen customers embrace a blended fleet too. \nJohn Molloy: Exactly, right. In fact, all three of those customers have APX Original and like 1/3 of those are APX NEXT. \nJason Winkler: Good point. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of George Notter with Jefferies. \nGeorge Notter: Congrats on the strength here. I guess I'll go back to kind of the Airwave situation. I saw the renewal and the extension of the contract. Anything new there in terms of the CMA situation, obviously, you guys adjusted your financials to reflect the negative outcome. But I know there's a court case, an appeal that's going on? I mean, any expectations or anything you can tell us about what's going on there would be great. \nGregory Brown: Yes. Thanks, George. So we recorded the backlog of the extension of years '27, '28 and '29, because in March, we received notice from the U.K. Home Office for the extension of Airwave. Aside from our disputes, let's put that off to the side for a minute. I think it confirms our belief all along in the durability, longevity and quite frankly, criticality of mission-critical LMR, particularly in this case, Airwave. So it reaffirms the long-standing need of how critical that technology is, and that's one of the best performing from a network performance standpoint, emergency networks in the world. \n To your point, we took the backlog and recorded it at kind of worst-case scenario, i.e., it's logged -- the log backlog is at the charge control rates, which we are still contesting. As it relates to the Court of Appeal, we -- the CMA issued their final decision. We appealed to the CAT, the Competition Appeals Tribunal. We lost that. And as a result, appealed to the Court of Appeal, the U.K. Court of Appeal to see if they'll hear that case. We would expect to get clarity on that either in May or June. But having said that, we will continue to defend our position on the circumstances and conditions that extended Airwave, and we will defend ourselves accordingly. \nGeorge Notter: Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. Any evidence that there's any spread of other managed services customers looking at trying to reprice contracts with you guys anywhere else in the world? \nGregory Brown: No. No. I think the U.K. is very, very unique in many ways, but the answer is no. . \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. \nUnknown Analyst: You've got Jamie Reynolds on for Meta. I appreciate you taking the questions. I think last quarter, you guys had highlighted a $100 million headwind from less business in Ukraine. I guess, has your thinking changed there as it relates to the recent aid package that got passed? \nGregory Brown: Our view on the full year and what's informing our raise does not change from what we updated you on the Ukraine situation last year. We did talk about $100 million, Jack referenced that about $100 million headwind. By the way, that headwind still exists. It's primarily in the second half of this year, which informs kind of the seasonality that's implied in both Q2 and our full year guide. By the way, we remain in game, I'm thrilled. We're thrilled that the Foreign Aid Bill got passed for $95 billion and Molloy's team remains actively engaged on multiple fronts. But our view in terms of the full year guide is unchanged from what we said last time. \nUnknown Analyst: Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. Is the thinking changed around what you expect from the Command Center piece of the business to contribute to growth this year? \nGregory Brown: Still very enthusiastic about Command Center overall as a category. We still expect 10% growth for the full year. By the way, I might add that remember, ESN in the way we record revenue was in the Command Center technology bucket. So Q1 would have grown handsome double digits normalized for U.K. Home Office. And quite frankly, when you look at the 10% guide implied for Command Center for the full year, it's a number higher than that when you normalize for ESN as well. And you may want to mention just some of the other things going on. \nMahesh Saptharishi: We just actually finished our summit. This has been our largest summit, I think, ever, over 1,300 customers attending. We launched our VESTA NEXT refreshed products, both for cloud and for on-prem, along with quite a few other new launches or responder, our mobile app. So it's been -- traction has been amazing, and we see greater than 60% of our Command Center customers now adopting a cloud connected product and Rave and our other Command Center cloud products are doing exceptionally well beyond expectations. . \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. \nAdam Tindle: I just want to start maybe first for Jason. Great performance on margins in the Product segment. Just wondering how much of the pricing benefit and supply chain cost is reflected in this versus how much is left in future quarters? I know Q1 is typically the low point for margins in that segment. I'm wondering if that's still going to hold for 2024 and improve from there. \n And Greg, just conceptually on the topic of margins, I know expanding margins is important to you. The drivers are very clear to us in fiscal '24 price cost, et cetera. But it's a little bit less obvious as we think about fiscal '25 and beyond. Just if you could help us maybe with conceptual levers to continue to drive margin expansion beyond this year? Or do you think we're sort of at optimal margin and the focus might be more on growth, how to balance that equation. \nJason Winkler: Sure. So I'll take the first one. We remain seeing the $60 million of lower broker costs, we call the PPV that we guided to 90 days ago. That's a full year number. Q1 included some of that benefit. There's more to go in getting to the total $60 million. We're on path for that. We are seeing certainly the need to use far less and the supply improvements from our direct vendors are helping us get the parts we need at the price we need. That's in part what informed our Q1 as well as our expectations for the year, complemented by the continued strong demand. So on plan in terms of the margin improvements related to lower supply chain costs, I would also point to what we talked about on the call is the continued benefit of customers adopting more feature-rich parts of the portfolio. That comes with a margin improvement for us as well. \nGregory Brown: And in terms of margins, we -- by the way, this year, we do expect gross margins to be up slightly, and we also now expect operating margins to be up about 75 basis points. As we think about it holistically and kind of on a pro forma basis, we think the levers of volume mix, which we're enjoying now, some surgical price increases, primarily around services, where we have contracts that have appropriate cost of living mechanisms built into multiyear services contracts. And as they come due we will be disciplined in making sure we're recovering appropriate cost increases that come and hit the firm. \n We look at the way we price new product as well and we continue to refresh the device portfolio and also fixed and mobile video. And then OpEx. By the way, OpEx probably will be up about $100 million this year, year-on-year. Last quarter, we told you it was about $80 million. That $20 million increase, actually, I think it's a good thing. We're investing more in the business, indexing particularly around video. We're likely to have some higher incentives around sales commissions, reflective of the higher revenue guide we're giving you for the full year. And there's some ancillary legal costs, which I actually consider investments in the business as we defend our position, both with the U.K. Home Office and continue to fight the good fight on Hytera and we'll report hopefully more news between now and the end of the year on that front. \n And the other thing I'd tell you on the OpEx side, as you know, we acquired Silent Sentinel. Given the balance sheet, the aperture is pretty wide but disciplined on acquisitions we may pursue and close. And if we do that, we do that because it's financially accretive, it's strategically important. It's culturally compatible, and we can operate it or operationalize it and integrate it operationally, but also because we expect synergies on that front, too. We are built, I think, as a team, an executive team and as a company, that growing is not good enough. You've got to grow top line, you got to grow margins, you got to grow operating cash flow and you got to take share. That's when you know the firm is cooking on all cylinders. And we always look at operating margins. We're proud of them, but we know the there's more work to be done. \n And by the way, I didn't even mention AI. I know a lot of companies tout it, but we'll be disciplined in our use of that internally, the [indiscernible] Jack have built it into a lot of our products in the analytics that Jason mentioned. I love what we're doing, descriptive and Generative AI as it relates to the ecosystem, around public safety and physical security. But obviously, we'll also use it in customer service internally in legal and contract management with copilot and engineering efficiencies. So that really isn't factored in at this point, and I'm not making any declaration of promises, but we'll always be able to, I think, aspirationally drive toward operating margin improvement. And I think we have the assets where we can continue to do that. \nAdam Tindle: Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up. I know that was a 2-parter, but I'll do a quick follow-up since I'm going to get asked on this tonight. Backlog trends. Obviously, we've got a record here. But correct me if I'm wrong, I think that $14.4 billion includes $748 million of incremental backlog on Airwave. It may be unfair to strip that out, but if we do, it's down about $500 million sequentially. And I know there's some seasonality to that, but that's kind of 2x its normal seasonality. What would that concern of stripping that out and looking at kind of a worse than typical seasonal decline in backlog be missing? And how do you think about backlog trends from here? \nJason Winkler: So Adam, I mentioned it earlier, if I -- if we exclude the Home Office impact on a multi-quarter basis, total backlog is up over $500 million and S&S backlog is up over $600 million. So while we recorded the $748 million in this Q1 related to the extension of years '27, '28, '29. We also in the quarter before that, reduced the backlog related to the pricing control implemented for years, '24, '25 and '26. So they're a bit of a cancellation, if you will, and then the core of the business at Home Office is absolutely growing. \nOperator: I will pause for a few seconds to see if we have any additional questions. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the floor over to Mr. Greg Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for any additional comments or closing remarks. \nGregory Brown: Yes. Thank you. First and foremost, I want to thank the Motorola Solutions employees around the world and our channel partners. It's a great team, very proud of the performance in the quarter and very proud of what I think we can do between now and the end of the year. I do want to highlight, we had some great significant events in Q1, Mahesh mentioned 1 of them, the Solutions Summit in Dallas. A week ago, we had 1,300 customers. It's the largest ever event we had on that front. We demonstrated operational working public safety an enterprise security ecosystem. It was significant, well attended and lots of good feedback. \n We had our first-ever joint channel partner -- executive partner forum, in February, in Orlando. The significance of that is it brought together LMR, Land Mobile Radio channel partners and Video Security and Access Control under 1 roof with common vernacular, common language, relationships we're looking to develop. And Molloy's had this mantra cross-sell, upsell. I thought that was an excellent event that was a catalyst to kind of culture and focus items we need around upselling the writ large broader portfolio between now and the end of the year. And we had a great presence at ISC West, which highlighted, of course, Video Security and Access Control, rolled out our enterprise body-worn camera, which we're getting great traction on body worn on the enterprise. So a lot of good stuff in Q1. \n Look, at the end of the day, the print is great in Q1, but I'm actually more excited about our momentum, raising the year, strong backlog, but also strong funnel of opportunity and a strong balance sheet couldn't be more proud. I want to thank everybody. Thanks for listening, and we'll talk to you in a quarter. \nOperator: This does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the Internet within 3 hours. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com/investor. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Jason Winkler",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Revenue for the quarter grew 10% and was above our guidance with strong growth in all three technologies. GAAP operating earnings were $519 million or 21.7% of sales, up from 18.4% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $638 million, up 20% from the year ago quarter and non-GAAP operating margin was 26.7%, up 220 basis points. \n The strong year-over-year increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings was driven by higher sales a favorable mix shift as our customers invest in more feature-rich LMR products and improved operating leverage, offset by the U.K. CMA charge control related to Airwave. GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.23 and included a $585 million charge, resulting in a $3.42 per share pretax nonoperating loss due to the accounting treatment for the settlement of the Silver Lake convertible notes.  \n We settled these notes entirely in cash for approximately $1.59 billion inclusive of the conversion premium, which eliminated potential dilution to our share count and reflected a favorable negotiated settlement price compared to the indenture terms. As a result, we recognized a nonoperating loss for the settlement during the quarter. According to the current accounting rules for convertible notes, which were updated in 2022. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.81, up 27% from $2.22 last year. This strong growth in EPS was driven by higher sales and margins, lower interest cost and a lower diluted share count. OpEx in Q1 was $568 million, up $38 million versus last year, primarily due to higher employee incentives and acquisitions.  \n Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow was a Q1 record of $382 million, up $390 million versus last year, and free cash flow was $336 million, up $398 million. The strong increase in cash flow was driven by improved working capital and higher earnings net of noncash charges. Capital allocation for Q1 included $163 million in cash dividends $46 million of CapEx and $39 million of share repurchases. We also used $593 million of cash to settle the Silver Lake conversion premium and we closed the acquisition of Silent Sentinel, a provider of specialized long-range cameras for $37 million net of cash required.  \n Moving to segment results. In Products and SI, sales were up 14% versus last year, driven by continued strong demand, combined with improved supply availability and a favorable mix shift in LMR products. Operating earnings were $370 million or 24.8% of sales, up from 18.9% in the prior year, driven by higher sales, favorable mix and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q1 wins and achievements in this segment include a $22 million P25 device order for a large U.S. customer, a $16 million LMR order for an international customer, a $13 million order for the State of Tennessee and a $13 million mobile video order for North Carolina State Highway Patrol.  \n In Software and Services, revenue was up 4% compared to last year. S&S revenues, excluding the U.K. home office were up 12%, driven by strong growth in all three technologies. Operating earnings in the segment were $268 million or 29.8% of sales down from the 32.9% of sales last year due to the impact of the Airwave charge control. Excluding the impact of the U.K. Airwave charge control, Software and Services margins increased year-over-year, driven primarily by higher sales and improved operating leverage. Some notable Q1 highlights in this segment include a $25 million LMR services order for Douglas County, Colorado, a $25 million LMR services order for U.K. Department of Health, an $18 million Command Center order for the city of San Francisco, a $14 million LMR services order for Lithuania and an $11 million services order for Sa\u0303o Paulo State Police in Brazil.  \n Moving next to our regional results. North America Q1 revenue was $1.7 billion, up 13% on strong double-digit growth in both segments. International Q1 revenue was $696 million, up 3% versus last year with growth in video and LMR, offset by lower U.K. home office revenues related to the U.K. home office Airwave charge control and our exit of ESN. International revenue, excluding the U.K. home office impact increased double digits year-over-year in both segments.  \n Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was a record $14.4 billion, up $331 million versus last year, driven primarily by strong demand for multiyear Software and Services contracts in both regions. The year-over-year increase is inclusive of the reduction of $777 million booked in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the Airwave charge control and revenue recognition for Airwave and ESN over the last year. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a $748 million of backlog related to the receipt of a 3-year extension notice from the U.K. home office for years 2027 through 2029.  \n Our total backlog, excluding the U.K. Home Office was up over $500 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $138 million, driven by the extension notice related to Airwave that I just mentioned, partially offset by our typical Q4 to Q1 order seasonality in North America and some favorable -- unfavorable FX. In the Products and SI segment, ending backlog was down $74 million, primarily due to unfavorable FX. Sequentially, backlog was down $354 million due to the Q4 to Q1 North America order seasonality that I mentioned.  \n And then Software and Services backlog was up $404 million compared to last year, driven by strong demand for multiyear services contracts in both regions. Our S&S backlog, excluding the U.K. Home Office was up almost $600 million compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $492 million, driven primarily by the extension notice related to Airwave, partially offset by Q4 to Q1 order seasonality.  \n Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up between 7% and 8% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $2.97 and $3.02 per share. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 170 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. And for the full year, we are increasing both our revenue and EPS guidance. \n We now expect revenue growth of approximately 7%, up from our prior guidance of approximately 6%. And with that, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share between $12.98 and $13.08 per share, up from our prior guidance of $12.62 to $12.72 per share. In addition, with the U.S. dollar strengthening since our last call, this full year outlook now assumes an FX headwind of $30 million, primarily in the second half. It also includes a weighted average diluted share count between 170 million and 171 million shares and an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. And finally, as a result of the debt issuance and Silver Lake settlement we completed in Q1 and we now expect full year interest expense to be approximately $240 million, up $25 million year-over-year.  \n Before turning the call back to Greg, I want to highlight, just a couple of balance sheet-related items. During the quarter, we used $593 million to settle in cash the premium for the Silver Lake notes that I mentioned. We also repurchased 39 million of shares, resulting together in a combined total of $632 million targeted at reducing our diluted share count. \n Also during the quarter, both S&P and Fitch upgraded our credit ratings to BBB underlying the strength of our business and the balance sheet. Following the upgrades, we issued $1.3 billion of debt, $900 million of 10-year and $400 million of 5-year notes, further extending our average debt maturity, which is now over 8 years, all fixed at an average rate below 4.5%. We used a portion of the proceeds from the new debt issuance to pay off the $1 billion convertible notes and plan to use the remainder to settle the approximately $300 million of debt maturity coming due later this year.  \n I'll now turn the call back to Greg. And Tim, on the second part of your question, you're right, software within video is growing faster than the product side. That's a trend we've been seeing. And keep in mind, it's not just Alta, it's all of the exciting developments that we have around analytics. Both of our VMSs, our software products are recorded there. Mobile video is also there, all complemented by cloud subscription. So that's a very important and fast-growing part of our business. Now the LMR piece. Jack, you've seen customers embrace a blended fleet too. Good point. Sure. So I'll take the first one. We remain seeing the $60 million of lower broker costs, we call the PPV that we guided to 90 days ago. That's a full year number. Q1 included some of that benefit. There's more to go in getting to the total $60 million. We're on path for that. We are seeing certainly the need to use far less and the supply improvements from our direct vendors are helping us get the parts we need at the price we need. That's in part what informed our Q1 as well as our expectations for the year, complemented by the continued strong demand. So on plan in terms of the margin improvements related to lower supply chain costs, I would also point to what we talked about on the call is the continued benefit of customers adopting more feature-rich parts of the portfolio. That comes with a margin improvement for us as well. So Adam, I mentioned it earlier, if I -- if we exclude the Home Office impact on a multi-quarter basis, total backlog is up over $500 million and S&S backlog is up over $600 million. So while we recorded the $748 million in this Q1 related to the extension of years '27, '28, '29. We also in the quarter before that, reduced the backlog related to the pricing control implemented for years, '24, '25 and '26. So they're a bit of a cancellation, if you will, and then the core of the business at Home Office is absolutely growing."

            "name": "John Molloy",
            "content": "The only thing Tim I'd add on top of that is, as just Greg pointed out, it's the breadth of the portfolio is a strength. But what's particularly driving the APX NEXT adoption are the applications. So in the quarter, in Q1, we secured two large state patrols as well as one Department of Transportation, as you think about what drives those, it's location. It's the ability to extend the network vis-a-vis SmartConnect and SmartProgramming with large fleets, their ability to reprogram and the like in a more expeditious fashion, so. Exactly, right. In fact, all three of those customers have APX Original and like 1/3 of those are APX NEXT."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Gregory Brown",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and outlook. First, Q1 was an outstanding start to the year. We achieved revenue growth of 10%, earnings per share growth of 27%, expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and generated record Q1 operating cash flow of $382 million. We also finished the quarter with $14.4 billion of backlog, up $300 million versus last year. \n Second, our outstanding Q1 performance was broad-based. In our Products and SI segment, revenue was up 14% and operating margins increased 590 basis points as we continue to see strong demand for our feature-rich LMR products, including APX NEXT and our refreshed PCR portfolio. In Software and Services revenue was up 4%, inclusive of the Airwave of charge control and our exit from the ESN contract. \n Excluding U.K. home office revenues, Software and Services revenues increased double digits, driven by continued strong demand for our LMR service offerings and our software applications in Video Security and Command Center. And finally, based on our strong start to the year and continued robust demand, we're raising both our revenue and earnings guidance for the full year.  \n I'll now turn the call over to Jason. Thanks, Jason. And let me just close with a few thoughts. First, Q1 was outstanding across the Board. We achieved strong revenue growth in all three technologies. We significantly increased operating margins. We generated record Q1 operating backlog -- operating cash flow and our strong ending backlog positions us well going forward. As a result, we're raising our expectations for both revenue and earnings for the full year. \n Second, during the quarter, we announced that we mutually agreed with Silver Lake to settle the convertible notes. Silver Lake has been a great partner since their initial investment in 2015, and I'm very pleased that Greg Mondre is remaining on our Board. And finally, as I look forward, I'm exceptionally pleased with how well we're positioned. \n The investments we've made in our LMR product portfolio are driving meaningful revenue growth and margin expansion. Our recurring revenues are increasing as a result of the continued strong demand for our services. We continue to see accelerated adoption of our cloud offerings, including Rave and Command Center and Avigilon Alta in Video Security and our strong balance sheet positions us well to invest both organically and inorganically for continued growth. \n We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash, still expect to generate $2.2 billion of operating cash flow for the year. We refinanced and extended a portion of our debt portfolio, and we received upgrades from two credit rating agencies during the quarter. All of this provides us with significant continued flexibility in how we deploy capital going forward. \n I'll now turn the call over to Tim and look forward to your questions. Yes. Tim, on Video, pleased with the results in Q1. As you know, we remain convicted around the 10% for the full year. We did talk about last quarter that we are seeing an increased adoption to Avigilon Alta and cloud adoption. We talked last quarter and it remains unchanged. That's probably about -- probably a $40 million estimated headwind in terms of the top line growth number that informs the 10% but feel very good about Q1's performance. And by the way, in particular, the orders for video were strong, both in fixed and mobile. Yes. I think -- look, I can't be more pleased with the performance of LMR products and services. And Jack talked about the continued strong demand last quarter, it's the same as this quarter. In terms of APX NEXT, as an example, a lot of customers are indexing and in Q1 indexed to more feature-rich devices which helped drive revenue and quite frankly, Tim, margin expansion. \n But I'd actually -- I think the way to think about LMR growth is APX writ large, the entire segment for APX Radio. They're newer. They've been upgraded. We talk about APX NEXT, which is the very high end, but the whole portfolio which we also talk about APX Originals performing exceptionally well. And then when you go over to TETRA and PCR, where we've refreshed devices there as well, that's gone very well. In fact, PCR, we now expect to grow slightly up off of record levels last year. So I'd say we're still in the middle of the game on device refresh with a lot more to run. Really pleased on that front. Yes. Thanks, George. So we recorded the backlog of the extension of years '27, '28 and '29, because in March, we received notice from the U.K. Home Office for the extension of Airwave. Aside from our disputes, let's put that off to the side for a minute. I think it confirms our belief all along in the durability, longevity and quite frankly, criticality of mission-critical LMR, particularly in this case, Airwave. So it reaffirms the long-standing need of how critical that technology is, and that's one of the best performing from a network performance standpoint, emergency networks in the world. \n To your point, we took the backlog and recorded it at kind of worst-case scenario, i.e., it's logged -- the log backlog is at the charge control rates, which we are still contesting. As it relates to the Court of Appeal, we -- the CMA issued their final decision. We appealed to the CAT, the Competition Appeals Tribunal. We lost that. And as a result, appealed to the Court of Appeal, the U.K. Court of Appeal to see if they'll hear that case. We would expect to get clarity on that either in May or June. But having said that, we will continue to defend our position on the circumstances and conditions that extended Airwave, and we will defend ourselves accordingly. No. No. I think the U.K. is very, very unique in many ways, but the answer is no. . Our view on the full year and what's informing our raise does not change from what we updated you on the Ukraine situation last year. We did talk about $100 million, Jack referenced that about $100 million headwind. By the way, that headwind still exists. It's primarily in the second half of this year, which informs kind of the seasonality that's implied in both Q2 and our full year guide. By the way, we remain in game, I'm thrilled. We're thrilled that the Foreign Aid Bill got passed for $95 billion and Molloy's team remains actively engaged on multiple fronts. But our view in terms of the full year guide is unchanged from what we said last time. Still very enthusiastic about Command Center overall as a category. We still expect 10% growth for the full year. By the way, I might add that remember, ESN in the way we record revenue was in the Command Center technology bucket. So Q1 would have grown handsome double digits normalized for U.K. Home Office. And quite frankly, when you look at the 10% guide implied for Command Center for the full year, it's a number higher than that when you normalize for ESN as well. And you may want to mention just some of the other things going on. And in terms of margins, we -- by the way, this year, we do expect gross margins to be up slightly, and we also now expect operating margins to be up about 75 basis points. As we think about it holistically and kind of on a pro forma basis, we think the levers of volume mix, which we're enjoying now, some surgical price increases, primarily around services, where we have contracts that have appropriate cost of living mechanisms built into multiyear services contracts. And as they come due we will be disciplined in making sure we're recovering appropriate cost increases that come and hit the firm. \n We look at the way we price new product as well and we continue to refresh the device portfolio and also fixed and mobile video. And then OpEx. By the way, OpEx probably will be up about $100 million this year, year-on-year. Last quarter, we told you it was about $80 million. That $20 million increase, actually, I think it's a good thing. We're investing more in the business, indexing particularly around video. We're likely to have some higher incentives around sales commissions, reflective of the higher revenue guide we're giving you for the full year. And there's some ancillary legal costs, which I actually consider investments in the business as we defend our position, both with the U.K. Home Office and continue to fight the good fight on Hytera and we'll report hopefully more news between now and the end of the year on that front. \n And the other thing I'd tell you on the OpEx side, as you know, we acquired Silent Sentinel. Given the balance sheet, the aperture is pretty wide but disciplined on acquisitions we may pursue and close. And if we do that, we do that because it's financially accretive, it's strategically important. It's culturally compatible, and we can operate it or operationalize it and integrate it operationally, but also because we expect synergies on that front, too. We are built, I think, as a team, an executive team and as a company, that growing is not good enough. You've got to grow top line, you got to grow margins, you got to grow operating cash flow and you got to take share. That's when you know the firm is cooking on all cylinders. And we always look at operating margins. We're proud of them, but we know the there's more work to be done. \n And by the way, I didn't even mention AI. I know a lot of companies tout it, but we'll be disciplined in our use of that internally, the [indiscernible] Jack have built it into a lot of our products in the analytics that Jason mentioned. I love what we're doing, descriptive and Generative AI as it relates to the ecosystem, around public safety and physical security. But obviously, we'll also use it in customer service internally in legal and contract management with copilot and engineering efficiencies. So that really isn't factored in at this point, and I'm not making any declaration of promises, but we'll always be able to, I think, aspirationally drive toward operating margin improvement. And I think we have the assets where we can continue to do that. Yes. Thank you. First and foremost, I want to thank the Motorola Solutions employees around the world and our channel partners. It's a great team, very proud of the performance in the quarter and very proud of what I think we can do between now and the end of the year. I do want to highlight, we had some great significant events in Q1, Mahesh mentioned 1 of them, the Solutions Summit in Dallas. A week ago, we had 1,300 customers. It's the largest ever event we had on that front. We demonstrated operational working public safety an enterprise security ecosystem. It was significant, well attended and lots of good feedback. \n We had our first-ever joint channel partner -- executive partner forum, in February, in Orlando. The significance of that is it brought together LMR, Land Mobile Radio channel partners and Video Security and Access Control under 1 roof with common vernacular, common language, relationships we're looking to develop. And Molloy's had this mantra cross-sell, upsell. I thought that was an excellent event that was a catalyst to kind of culture and focus items we need around upselling the writ large broader portfolio between now and the end of the year. And we had a great presence at ISC West, which highlighted, of course, Video Security and Access Control, rolled out our enterprise body-worn camera, which we're getting great traction on body worn on the enterprise. So a lot of good stuff in Q1. \n Look, at the end of the day, the print is great in Q1, but I'm actually more excited about our momentum, raising the year, strong backlog, but also strong funnel of opportunity and a strong balance sheet couldn't be more proud. I want to thank everybody. Thanks for listening, and we'll talk to you in a quarter."
