At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Enterprise Products Partners Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  Mr. Randy Burkhalter, Vice President of Investor Relations, will begin your conference. Please go ahead, sir.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Dexter, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2020 earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise's General Partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, based on the beliefs of the Company, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during the call. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\nJames Teague: Thank you, Randy. As we said in this morning's press release, our business has continued to perform well throughout 2020. We reported net income attributable to common unitholders for 2020 of $3.8 billion, or $1.71 per unit compared to $4.6 billion, or $2.09 per unit on a fully diluted basis for 2019. Net income for 2020 was reduced by non-cash asset impairment charges of approximately $891 million, which Randy is going to address. Distributable cash flow was $6.4 billion for 2020 compared to $6.6 billion for 2019. DCF provided 1.6 times coverage, and we retained $2.5 billion of DCF in 2020 to reinvest in the partnership. We completed 2020 with significant financial flexibility and in a strong balance sheet. We really are proud of Enterprise\u2019s employees for their dedication and perseverance and responding to the challenges during 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The diversification of our businesses across multiple commodities, the magnitude of our transportation and storage assets, the depth of our marketing activities, and our cost control efforts enabled us to generate distributable cash flow just 3% shy of the record DCF we earned in 2019.\nRandall Fowler: Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing some fourth quarter income statement items. Net income attributable to common unit holders for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $337 million, or $0.15 per unit on a fully diluted basis, compared to $1.1 billion or $0.50 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2019. Net income for the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019 were reduced by non-cash asset impairment and related charges of approximately $800 million or $0.36 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2020 and $82 million, or $0.04 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2019. The impairment charges recorded in 2020 were primarily for goodwill associated with the partnerships, natural gas pipelines and services segment and for certain long lived assets including those associated with our marine business that is our barge and push  business and natural gas gathering and processing facilities.  Moving on to cash flows. Cash flows from operations was $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter 2019. On a full year basis cash flow from operations was $5.9 billion and $6.5 billion for 2020 and 2019 respectively. Cash flow from operations for 2020 and 2019 were both reduced by $768 million and $457 million respectively, for cash used for working capital.  Free cash flow for 2020 which we define as cash flow from operations minus investing activities less distributions to non-controlling interest was $2.7 billion for the year, which is an 8% increase compared to free cash flow for 2019. Our payout ratio which we define as the sum of cash distributions and buybacks, as a percent of cash flow from operations was 70% for 2020, 67% from distribution and distribution equivalent rights, and another 3% from common unit buybacks. \nRandy Burkhalter: Okay. Thank you, Randy. Dexter, we are ready to take questions from our listeners.\nOperator: Thank you.  Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet. Your line is now open. \nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJames Teague: Good morning. \nJeremy Tonet: Just want to start off on the supply side, if I could, maybe just a question for Tony and Jim here, and just wondering what your latest thoughts are given producer conversations on the outlook for supply growth, from what we can see, it looks like the Permian will continue to grow. Other basins could decline in the Permian kind of take share here. Just wondering what your thoughts are for supply, GMP supply going forward. And also, with federal land issues, they're kind of encroaching on the Permian thoughts on that and how this all kind of impacts EPD?\nAnthony Chovanec: Jeremy, we're going to produce a new supply forecast at the Analyst Day. But the long and the short of it is if you look at what public producers are saying and what they're telling us, they plan on remaining flat in 2021. And flat being most of them couch it as where they exited 2020, where they plan on exiting 2021. And you are correct that the Permian is going to be the lion's share of the activity. That said, we are seeing some increase in activity and production in the Eagle Ford that we like to see. And then I guess, now, I'll move to the federal acreage comment. And it's early on to this. Brent may want to chime in, it's early on to this pronouncement from the Biden administration kind of two weeks into it. But when we look at the Permian acreage, and we back up and look at what we consider active acreage, it's nearly 15 million acres.  Only about 12% of that, as we gauge it is on federal land. And on that federal land, there's some approximately 2,000 permits probably more as we speak in 600 or 700 DUCs. What we're hearing from producers, I think, ramping and let me know if you feel differently, some are actually speeding up. Most are saying at this point, no change. And I would say few, if any, at this point said I'm laying a rig or two down because they're well permitted. They saw that it might come and that's where they're headed. There's a lot of political pushback. This is big for the state of New Mexico. And so, stay tuned. But when we look at it holistically, this is how we feel. Brent, did I miss anything? \nBrent Secrest: No, I think you covered it, Tony. In terms of some green shoots, we are seeing some private guys be more active out there with put more rigs in play. When we talk to our customers and I think the simple answer is we don't know what's going to happen. But when we talk to our customers, it feels like they have a timeline to go ahead and execute the permits that they have. And it's not a rush to go out there and get it done. So, it's kind of a case by case basis, depending on the producer, but I haven't sensed panic from talking to our customers. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And maybe kind of building off that supply impact as you see it for 2021 here. Just wondering if you couple that with, I guess, the turnarounds in the petchem segment. Does this mean that kind of you expect 2021 EBITDA would step down from 2020? Or are there any other kind of big moving pieces that we should be thinking about?\nRandall Fowler: Yes, Jeremy, I'd say, I think we're - based on what we see thus far, we think, we can hold it flat. And could it be soft $100 million, $200 million? Could be. But I tell you what, never doubt. The resolve of this organization to come in and capture opportunities. So we'll see, I think we're in good shape going into the year. \nJeremy Tonet : That's very helpful. I'll stop there. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Thank you very much. You may ask your question.\nColton Bean: Good morning. So with the total capital down nearly 40% for this upcoming year and leverage effectively at your long-term target, can you just update us on how you're thinking about payout ratio for 2021?\nRandall Fowler : Yes, and I\u2019d really refer back to the comments that I had in the conference call script. I think, we do expect to start generating discretionary free cash flow in the second half of the year. A good bit of our CapEx is skewed more towards the beginning of the year. And - but we think we'll be discretionary free cash flow positive. At this point in time, we really don't want to provide any guidance on payout or I mean payout is still going to be pretty lofty. I mean, just given where our distribution is, since the distribution makes up a substantial amount of the cash that we returned to our investors. So it's still going to be fairly high just based on that. So as far as what we do on buyback, I think, we'd like to get a little bit farther into the year, again, a lot of uncertainties as we enter the beginning of this year. And we just like to get better visibility before we provide any guidance on that front.\nColton Bean: And then, Randy, just to follow-up on that. Do you see any benefit to going materially below that 3.5 times leverage target?\nRandall Fowler : We set on 3.5 times, it's - our definition of 3.5 times area is 3.5 plus or minus a quarter turn. So that's our target that we've been talking about that, being our target for two or three years now and we're still comfortable with that range.\nColton Bean: Understood. And then just on the propylene operations with the spread between PGP and RGP widening further year-to-date, any potential for the fracs to offset the PDH downtime here with Q1 upcoming?\nJames Teague: Where is Chris, you want to answer it?\nChristopher D'Anna: Sure. Yes, with the spreads the way they are, obviously, we're running out as hard as we can. So I think we're expecting to do as much as we can with that.\nJames Teague: Yes. This is Jim. The spreads are wide, but we don't have exposure to the total. I think we got exposure to about 30% of our capacity of that spread. So to the extent we have exposure, yes, we'll benefit. I'm not sure how much it'll make up. \nColton Bean: Appreciate that. And just a quick final one. The ethylene storage capacity, I don't think that was online until almost the end of December. Can you just update us on what you've seen there and how you're expecting exports to turn over the course of the year? Appreciate it. \nChristopher D'Anna: Our storage hub was actually online the prior year, but we finished our storage tank at the export terminal at the end of the year. And we were operating at pretty high rates before the tank was in service. And having that tank just allows us to optimize dock loadings and to load at higher rates. So really, at this point, we have contracts in place. But it's really going to be determined by the global arbitrage.\nJames Teague: Are you sold out?\nChristopher D'Anna: We're sold out with some opportunity for spot business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle May from Capital One Securities. Your line is open.\nKyle May: Hey, good morning, guys. I just wanted to maybe go into a little bit in the release, you talked about analyzing renewable project opportunities. So just want to get a feel for maybe what you're looking at and how that would fit with the business. \nRandall Fowler : Yes, it wasn't really renewable opportunities, what we said we've got some growth projects that we're looking at that are if you would consistent with the energy evolution, not necessarily specifically renewable projects. \nKyle May: Okay, got it. Appreciate that. Can you maybe go into a little bit more details on what those projects would be?\nRandall Fowler : Not really. \nKyle May: Okay, fair enough. And second question would be, I believe you mentioned that your growth CapEx could move a little bit higher to around $2 billion this year. Any more details around what would push you to that upper end?\nRandall Fowler : The previous question?\nKyle May: All right. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: We have a question from Jean Salisbury of Bernstein. Your line is open.\nJean Salisbury: Hi, good morning. Ethane storage in U.S is at record levels and frankly more ethane storage than I knew existed. Can you come in and assess mostly your inventory and perhaps your view on if this high storage will dampen ethane prices in 2021? \nBrent Secrest : Yes, I mean, we're seeing, we saw ethane storage peak in the fourth quarter, we're seeing it roll off as crackers came back online. Ethane was a little bit of a challenge during the fourth quarter as ethane  trying to clean up. I think you know, I think we're fundamentally bullish. A lot of things as it relates to hydrocarbons, I think in terms of an outright price on ethane, I still think you have to have some sort of baseline gas call. But if you look at how this market balances with demand and supply on that day and if you look at the demand coming online, you hear what Tony says about supply from talking to our customers. And you're seeing it happen. We've seen it happen the last several weeks, ethane, has to work and go to work to go price to get back into the NGL stream. So, whether that means coming from further away, or whether that means that people have to adjust prices in the Permian Basin, we believe that these markets need to balance and I think fundamentally -- I read reports, Jeannie, and I don't know if we're going to see some numbers that I've read from you a month or two months back, but I think we're aligned that we're fairly bullish, I think.\nJean Salisbury: Thank you. That's helpful. And Asia propane prices were quite high for much of December and January. Can you comment if you were able to capture a material amount of marketing margin there? Or did most of that go to the shipping company?\nBrent Secrest: This is Brent again. We have a massive presence in NGLs. So, when price goes to work in NGLs, I think it's fair to assume that somehow enterprise participate in it.\nJean Salisbury: Thanks a lot, Brent. That's all for me.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond from Simmons Energy. Your line is open.\nPearce Hammond: Yes, thank you and good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is what are your expectations for crude oil export volumes for 2021? And what are the puts and takes around that view?\nJames Teague: Okay, we're going this as the Brent Secrest show. Brent? Go to your answer that you gave earlier.\nBrent Secrest: If you look at our volumes, I can speak specifically to enterprise. Our volumes for crude exports have gone down. So, the pandemic has taught us a lot of things and one thing that it has taught us is something that we've preached over the last several years, is that Houston truly is a market. I understand and I see the numbers, too, that there's a lot of barrels going out a Corpus. I recognize the fact is, once the train leaves the station in Midland and the heads to Corpus, it has to go to the water. What we offer in Houston is truly a market and the domestic price that our customers achieve in Houston is higher than the price that they can achieve on the water. And that's the reason they've elected to not take the barrel across the water. Now as enterprise from a profitability standpoint, I'd say we're somewhat agnostic to it, we can provide the service, we have no problem providing the service, but the domestic price in Houston is higher than Corpus. So, at some point, the market is going to require that barrel to go across the water once the global market needs that barrel. But right now, our customers are achieving a higher net back in Houston.\nPearce Hammond: Okay.\nBrent Secrest: So, you could see the volumes decline. But when it comes to revenue, frankly, our revenue stays flat. It will continue to stay flat for quite some time and then when we have to export, frankly, there's additional, expenses that you undertake from exporting.\nPearce Hammond: Okay, that's super helpful. Thank you. And then my follow up is, can you elaborate on the drivers of the current strength in the NGL market and how sustainable you think those are for 2021? And that's following up on some of the earlier questions.\nJustin Kleiderer: Yes, this is Justin Kleiderer. I think it's all chemical-driven. The demand for plastics as a function of what we've been experiencing throughout 2020, I think we expect to continue and that's supporting the entire NGL value chain.\nPearce Hammond: What about your exports in Asia?\nJustin Kleiderer: On the export front, we continue to seem to set records on volume every quarter. We did in the fourth quarter as well and I think we expect volumes to remain robust through 2021.\nPearce Hammond: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to get your thoughts on what's been going on at the Panama Canal and how that impacts or could impact in the future LPG movements, kind of more on a long term basis?\nJustin Kleiderer: Yes, this is Justin again, I'll take a stab at it. I think what you saw and what you continue to see with the congestion could potentially change trade flows. However, I don't think that we expected to materially do so in which that would impact volumes across Gulf Coast docks. At the end of the day, barrels need to clear that demand needs it and they'll continue to pay the price to get it there.\nMichael Blum: Got it. Thank you. And then you have a line in the press release that your goal I guess, is to source 25% of your power from renewable sources by 2025. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that? Is that primarily replacing compressors along the pipelines? Or are there other areas where you think you're going to source that power?\nJames Teague: I think the power sourcing is from a wide variety of areas. Over the over the last number of years, if we look 10 years plus, we've been going more and more to electrical drivers as at our new facilities. The power is really sourced both from opportunistic, been able to go out and acquire solar power as well as the ERCOT grid provides a significant amount of renewable power.\nMichael Blum: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: We have a question from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to start off with a question on the Permian. There's been a lot of talk over the last year and-a-half or so about the Permian overbuilt thesis. I was just wondering if I can get your broader thoughts on it? Is the industry really discussing it correctly? And I'm kind of wondering along the lines of how we look at the egress out of the Permian. Is there a way to think about it in terms of egress to Cushing versus egress to demand centers? You were just talking about how great Houston is as kind of a demand center for a market? And so as we sort of think about it over time, when pipelines come up for re-contracting and so forth, is there going to be a different price for pipelines that evacuate crude to Houston Corpus to the demand centers versus towards Cushing? And should there should there be kind of a dual market that sort of emerges over time? And just kind of thinking about your thoughts on how that entirely plays itself out?\nJames Teague: This is Jim. Brent pointing his finger to me, but I got more high points than him. So, Brent, you want to answer that question?\nBrent Secrest: I think what we're seeing flown to Cushing, you guys could see the ARB  between Midland and the overcapacity build that's coming out of Midland. I think there are some barrels that this refinery complexes are going to want to go from Midland to Cushing. If you looked at volumes and what they've done month-over-month, they continue to go down. Much like most areas in this country, I would say there's too much pipeline capacity, going to Cushing. Now, how that pipeline capacity gets rationalized and how it gets repurposed, or what direction it flows, that remains to be seen. As far as Corpus in Houston, I'd argue, hey, they all work great when barrels are flowing and going straight to the water and there's no decision to make. There's a bunch of place that worked 15 months ago.\nJames Teague: Let's speak to the magnet you're building.\nBrent Secrest: In terms of what we offer to use in terms of the refining capacity, the access to from pipeline connectivity, if you look at the amount of storage of the Houston Gulf Coast versus Corpus, you're talking hundreds of millions of capacity taken in weather storms, like we saw in 2020, versus what they are for Corpus when you look at grades, what people can do with different grades, what the export customers want with different grades. And if you look at frankly, our announcement last week with Magellan, and working on a pricing point that there works frankly, for everybody, it works for producers, it should work for refiners, it should work for consumers. And in fact, there's transparency for people to go out and conduct their business long-term. Whether that's a hedge that they buy, or whether that's a hedge that they sell and then they can decide to execute on that, or they take it across the water or not -- but they don't have to take it across the water -- they can go sell it back in the market if the  doesn't work versus other ports where frankly, you have vessels floating around out there hoping the phone rings. Because once that phone rings and say, 'Hey, I need you,' then, frankly, the people, all they have to do is go beat the price in Midland. And I think that gets old after a while.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay. So bottom line, the evacuation to the Gulf Coast should be more valuable than the evacuation to Cushing?\nBrent Secrest: This is going to work overtime as contracts roll off. We got some sticky contracts that people have and markets evolve over time and people learn lessons. In terms of our presence on barrels going from Midland to Cushing is very, very small. But you can sit there and probably look at pipeline flows that are going from Midland to Cushing and say, that is something that is incredibly overbuilt.\nShneur Gershuni: Got it. Okay, perfect. Maybe to pivot a little bit here. Randy, in your prepared remarks, you'd mentioned the word -- you don't want to use the word programmatic. I definitely appreciate not wanting to say that with respect to buybacks, but you do have a target of 2% of CFFO, which is kind of programmatic in nature. Enterprise did buy back 3% of their stock last year. Have there been any internal discussions around raising that target to 5% or even 10% before green lighting growth capital? And it's part of the larger discussion around buybacks, just given where your debt is trading at, any thoughts on tolerating a quarter turn extra leverage just to use the opportunity to take out some units, given where they're trading? It would help obviously reduce the distribution, claim on cash flows? I think you put in your slides at 67%. Just wondering if you can give us an expanded discussion on that, on your thought process there?\nRandy Burkhalter: Yes, Shneur, I put that statement in there about opportunistic versus programmatic just to head off this question and I guess it didn't work. You asked a number of them there. The 2% target that we talked about for buybacks was really with respect to 2020. Coming in this year, again, we're getting into new territory in the second half of this year, as far as what we see now based on current expectations, where we'll be discretionary, free cash flow positive. And we just come back in, this has really been 2020 and even coming in here to 2021, has been a very dynamic environment with a lot of uncertainties. And boy, you can go down the list of sort of what the uncertainties are as we enter into this year and we're just not at a place we think it's premature to come in and provide any guidance on what we're going to do with returning capital, buybacks or distributions at this point in time. The distribution that we announced in January, I don't think that should have been a surprise to anybody. We've been increasing distributions 22 years in a row. So that shouldn't have been surprising. We talked about trying to keep purchase power priority  on our distribution. We don't have a lot of inflation, but we wanted to come in and go ahead and bump the distribution. But when it when it comes to the buyback, we just like to get a little bit more visibility for 2021.\nShneur Gershuni: All right, that makes sense. Appreciate the color today, guys. Thank you very much and stay safe.\nOperator: We have a question from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. One of the follow-up on the 2021 outlook. So in the past you've alluded to, I think $500 million to $600 million have sort of outsized spread, market-based opportunities was Permian crude spreads in 2019, contango trades in 2020. I'm wondering how you think about kind of what we're seeing in NGL and pet chem markets so far in Q1? If this is potentially the next thing to backfill what you saw in 2020, on contango and tying that into -- I think earlier, I just want to confirm you made a comment about 2021 maybe being flattish overall, the 2020 -- just how all that ties together? Thanks.\nJames Teague: Yes, Randy said it was going to be flattened and I endorsed that and it makes Justin Kleiderer nervous. So we'll turn it over to him.\nJustin Kleiderer: Yes, it's Justin, I think you hit on what I'm about to say for the reasons that I'm going to say it, which is, the opportunities that we see are certainly going to be different than the past and most certainly going to be different than 2020. But I think we firmly believe that they're going to be there. It could be on NGLs and pet chem, like you alluded to. I think we feel good about the opportunities out there. But, the future holds opportunities that we can't forecast, but we do forecasting to be there. So, we're geared up to meet Jim's target.\nKeith Stanley: Great. And then just one cleanup item. Just thinking about the working capital -- and I wouldn't normally ask this, but it's kind of large. You reference it was over $700 million use of cash in 2020. For working capital items. It was almost $500 million in 2019. So that's over a billion dollars. I'm assuming that's just related to greater storage and marketing, but when would you expect to get this cash back and just how should we think about that going forward?\nChristian Nelly: Keith, this is Chris Nelly. A lot of that working capital uses just -- if you look at the forward curve, it should be coming back over the next couple of quarters. But again, going back to what Justin just stated, that a lot of that is going to be dependent upon what market opportunities are out there and what working capital utilization will then be as a result. So again, those are self-liquidating short-term deals that have high returns.\nKeith Stanley: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ujjwal Pradhan from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask first on the growth projects that are going to service in 2021 that you noted in the press release. Could you talk about the costs associated with these with respect to the 2021 budget? And perhaps return expectations for the three projects in the press release?\nJames Teague: Yes, we typically don't talk about capital costs of specific projects. I will say this, that the projects, they're coming online, or all on time on budget. We also don't talk about returns of specific projects, a little bit for the same reason that we don't come in and are reluctant to talk about projects under development. We've got a lot of competitors on these calls and we just not to get into too much detail. In the earning support slides, we do provide a list of projects under development. Jackie, what page?\nUjjwal Pradhan: I got it. I see it in Page 6. My question was about each of these projects, sort of how much do the contribute to that? 2021 budget versus PDH 2, which I know is the big ticket item in the budget.\nJames Teague: So bear with me just a minute. Yes, when you when you come in and you look at the $1.6 billion that we expect to invest in capital projects in 2021, probably the PDH 2 represents about a third of it.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it. That helpful. Thanks for that. And a quick follow-up with regards to the planned increase in renewable power uses. Could you comment on whether that would be neutral to your current power costs or a reduction to it? Thank you.\nJames Teague: Could you repeat the question please?\nUjjwal Pradhan: The cost of the additional renewable power uses, will that be neutral to your current power costs or a reduction to it?\nJames Teague: It will be neutral to our current power costs.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. I actually have a couple several that are short-term kind of 202-focused, and then one longer-term one. On 2021, can you talk about the cadence of CapEx during the year? Meaning is it very front end loaded? When I think about the bill six of growth CapEx? That's the first question. The second is the $400 million or so of cost savings that you realized in 2020, does some of that come back in 2021? So, when you refer to flattish EBITDA, is there a cost to pressure or there are incremental OpEx savings? And then the last one is probably for Brent, or Tony. When Wink to Webster fully comes online, how do you think that impacts the battle between Houston and Corpus for crude and crude exports?\nRandall Fowler : Okay, Mike, I'll take that first one. Probably the as far as CapEx, there's a little bit more in the first half of the year compared to the second half, but not a lot. As far as the operating cost, a big driver for us in 2021 compared to 2020, will be the turnarounds that we have primarily at PDH and B. So that's a kind of an outlier compared to 2020. In 2020, we did a lot of focus on cost. We got some of our base cost structure down part through supply chain negotiations that enabled us to lower costs. We've also focused very much on data is driving how we manage our cost a lot on our power utilization in one area. Those are going to be sustainable costs track of optimization. And sometimes when we look at cost savings, we really look at overall value sometimes, particularly on the optimization of our fractionators, we're using a lot of data to drive that. Sometimes it's a cost reduction, sometimes it's just overall value optimization. But I feel good about going into 2021 and our cost management that we did in 2020. I will continue that on in 2021.\nBrent Secrest: This is Brent. I think with Wink to Webster, it's up right but it's going to continue to ramp up over the next several months. And so, we've seen this before Corpus' pipelines came on, took barrels from Houston. You look at the people involved with Wink to Webster, they're obviously going to go take barrels from pipelines that go to Corpus and all this stuff, when the tide starts rolling out, we'll find out who has contracts and who doesn't and what's sticky and what's not. So, I would expect barrels to decrease that are flown to corpus and roll over to Wink to Webster. There may be some pipelines that frankly, don't have contracts that are going to Houston that they may take from those pipelines. So, we've seen this happen over the last couple years.\nJames Teague: What's your pipeline? What's your contract position?\nBrent Secrest: To Jim's question, what's our contract position and Brad Martell  is going to go into this endless meeting. But we got about a million barrels a day of committed contracts for crude oil that last, caught out to 2028 and beyond. So it's hard for me to say that we're going to have a bunch of discretionary barrels until the Permian Basin recovers and that's going to take years, but I feel when it comes to weathering the storm, we'll be okay.\nMichael Lapides: Do you think there's an opportunity for other owners or even yourself to repurpose pipes? And if so -- to kind of hope hopefully tighten the crude pipeline market -- and if so, what kind of opportunities are out there? Do you see the NGL pipe market getting tighter as well? Or do you think that's as over-supplied is the crude side?\nBrent Secrest: I fundamentally believe that capacity has to be rationalized. And there's different ways to do that. And you can be repurposed or inefficient operators can frankly figure out something else to do. Those assets shut down. But the industry as a whole has to properly figure this out. As far as the details that we look at, we're not going to go into it, but I think it's naive to assume that we don't look at figuring out how to solve some of these capacity issues that are existing in the market.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.\nJames Teague: Dexter, we have time for one more question from our audience.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Eve Siegel from Siegel Asset Management. Your line is open.\nEve Siegel: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. My question really relates to growth the underlying premise, I think of most of the questions today goes back to what Jim sort of laid out, that fossil fuels are going to disappear. And so, it's more playing defense than playing offense. So the question really relates to how do you folks think about the long term, opportunities for growth? How much operating leverage is there right now? And what are the longer term, opportunities perhaps that you see going forward? And if I could, just want editorial real quick in terms of leverage and stock buybacks. I totally appreciate Shneur's question, but the other aspect of that is that, you have to live with the consequences and I think being conservative has really held you in pretty good position for a very long time. So, thanks, guys.\nRandall Fowler: Thank you, Eve.\nJames Teague: Eve, this is Jim. I'm not sure we can spell defense. We're always on the offense and we're working on some pretty exciting projects, recognizing that we need to be responsible about it. But we're looking at some pretty exciting things and Brent said, it takes years in the Permian. I'm a firm believer that price heals all ills and Tony is bullish on hydrocarbon prices in the future, but not as bullish as I am. And prices create supply. I think you're going to see -- I'm a believer in the Permian, I'm a believer in the Eagle Ford if you have federal land issues in New Mexico, we got a hell of a position in Eagle Ford, maybe be rigs go down there. So I feel pretty good about things, and I feel good about the things we're working on -- we said are out there, we're not going to talk about.\nRandall Fowler: Yes. And we appreciate your comment on that. You come back in and you look at the midstream over time. We went through a couple of periods where whether it was an investor-driven or whether it was general partners without ER driven. It was distribution-growth, distribution-growth, distribution-growth and you heard the request for that and you saw a lot of that. And a little bit we were conservative in that. We tried to do something that would -- again, we're trying to build a partnership that's durable for the long term. And a little bit of the tortoise and hare and you had a lot of midstream companies that got too far out over their skis on distribution growth. You've seen them come back in and cut. And a little bit when we think about returning capital, again, we're trying to build a durable partnership. We have a proven track record of returning capital back to our investors, 70% last year. But I think we're going to be deliberate in what we do and again, a lot of uncertainties. We'll continue to return capital to our investors. But the other thing I think, some of the mantra that you hear on buyback, buyback, buyback, these companies better watch out, you get too aggressive on buybacks and that can come in and bite you in the future, too. So that's a little bit why we're being deliberate. But I appreciate your comment.\nEve Siegel: Okay. Well, thanks, guys.\nJames Teague: Thank you, Eve. That ends our call today and the management team here at Enterprise really thanks you for joining us. We're going to leave the call now. Dexter, would you please give our listeners the replay information? And thank you all again for joining us.\nOperator: Okay.  And this concludes today's conference call. Thanks for joining.

            "content": "Thank you, Jim and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing some fourth quarter income statement items. Net income attributable to common unit holders for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $337 million, or $0.15 per unit on a fully diluted basis, compared to $1.1 billion or $0.50 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2019. Net income for the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019 were reduced by non-cash asset impairment and related charges of approximately $800 million or $0.36 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2020 and $82 million, or $0.04 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2019. The impairment charges recorded in 2020 were primarily for goodwill associated with the partnerships, natural gas pipelines and services segment and for certain long lived assets including those associated with our marine business that is our barge and push  business and natural gas gathering and processing facilities.  Moving on to cash flows. Cash flows from operations was $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter 2019. On a full year basis cash flow from operations was $5.9 billion and $6.5 billion for 2020 and 2019 respectively. Cash flow from operations for 2020 and 2019 were both reduced by $768 million and $457 million respectively, for cash used for working capital.  Free cash flow for 2020 which we define as cash flow from operations minus investing activities less distributions to non-controlling interest was $2.7 billion for the year, which is an 8% increase compared to free cash flow for 2019. Our payout ratio which we define as the sum of cash distributions and buybacks, as a percent of cash flow from operations was 70% for 2020, 67% from distribution and distribution equivalent rights, and another 3% from common unit buybacks. Yes, Jeremy, I'd say, I think we're - based on what we see thus far, we think, we can hold it flat. And could it be soft $100 million, $200 million? Could be. But I tell you what, never doubt. The resolve of this organization to come in and capture opportunities. So we'll see, I think we're in good shape going into the year. Yes, and I'd really refer back to the comments that I had in the conference call script. I think, we do expect to start generating discretionary free cash flow in the second half of the year. A good bit of our CapEx is skewed more towards the beginning of the year. And - but we think we'll be discretionary free cash flow positive. At this point in time, we really don't want to provide any guidance on payout or I mean payout is still going to be pretty lofty. I mean, just given where our distribution is, since the distribution makes up a substantial amount of the cash that we returned to our investors. So it's still going to be fairly high just based on that. So as far as what we do on buyback, I think, we'd like to get a little bit farther into the year, again, a lot of uncertainties as we enter the beginning of this year. And we just like to get better visibility before we provide any guidance on that front. We set on 3.5 times, it's - our definition of 3.5 times area is 3.5 plus or minus a quarter turn. So that's our target that we've been talking about that, being our target for two or three years now and we're still comfortable with that range. Yes, it wasn't really renewable opportunities, what we said we've got some growth projects that we're looking at that are if you would consistent with the energy evolution, not necessarily specifically renewable projects. Not really. The previous question? Okay, Mike, I'll take that first one. Probably the as far as CapEx, there's a little bit more in the first half of the year compared to the second half, but not a lot. As far as the operating cost, a big driver for us in 2021 compared to 2020, will be the turnarounds that we have primarily at PDH and B. So that's a kind of an outlier compared to 2020. In 2020, we did a lot of focus on cost. We got some of our base cost structure down part through supply chain negotiations that enabled us to lower costs. We've also focused very much on data is driving how we manage our cost a lot on our power utilization in one area. Those are going to be sustainable costs track of optimization. And sometimes when we look at cost savings, we really look at overall value sometimes, particularly on the optimization of our fractionators, we're using a lot of data to drive that. Sometimes it's a cost reduction, sometimes it's just overall value optimization. But I feel good about going into 2021 and our cost management that we did in 2020. I will continue that on in 2021. Thank you, Eve. Yes. And we appreciate your comment on that. You come back in and you look at the midstream over time. We went through a couple of periods where whether it was an investor-driven or whether it was general partners without ER driven. It was distribution-growth, distribution-growth, distribution-growth and you heard the request for that and you saw a lot of that. And a little bit we were conservative in that. We tried to do something that would -- again, we're trying to build a partnership that's durable for the long term.

            "content": "Sure. Yes, with the spreads the way they are, obviously, we're running out as hard as we can. So I think we're expecting to do as much as we can with that. Our storage hub was actually online the prior year, but we finished our storage tank at the export terminal at the end of the year. And we were operating at pretty high rates before the tank was in service. And having that tank just allows us to optimize dock loadings and to load at higher rates. So really, at this point, we have contracts in place. But it's really going to be determined by the global arbitrage. We're sold out with some opportunity for spot business."

The demand for plastics as a function of what we've been experiencing throughout 2020, I think we expect to continue and that's supporting the entire NGL value chain. On the export front, we continue to seem to set records on volume every quarter. We did in the fourth quarter as well and I think we expect volumes to remain robust through 2021. Yes, this is Justin again, I'll take a stab at it. I think what you saw and what you continue to see with the congestion could potentially change trade flows. However, I don't think that we expected to materially do so in which that would impact volumes across Gulf Coast docks. At the end of the day, barrels need to clear that demand needs it and they'll continue to pay the price to get it there. Yes, it's Justin, I think you hit on what I'm about to say for the reasons that I'm going to say it, which is, the opportunities that we see are certainly going to be different than the past and most certainly going to be different than 2020. But I think we firmly believe that they're going to be there. It could be on NGLs and pet chem, like you alluded to. I think we feel good about the opportunities out there. But, the future holds opportunities that we can't forecast, but we do forecasting to be there. So, we're geared up to meet Jim's target."

            "name": "James Teague",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. As we said in this morning's press release, our business has continued to perform well throughout 2020. We reported net income attributable to common unitholders for 2020 of $3.8 billion, or $1.71 per unit compared to $4.6 billion, or $2.09 per unit on a fully diluted basis for 2019. Net income for 2020 was reduced by non-cash asset impairment charges of approximately $891 million, which Randy is going to address. Distributable cash flow was $6.4 billion for 2020 compared to $6.6 billion for 2019. DCF provided 1.6 times coverage, and we retained $2.5 billion of DCF in 2020 to reinvest in the partnership. We completed 2020 with significant financial flexibility and in a strong balance sheet. We really are proud of Enterprise's employees for their dedication and perseverance and responding to the challenges during 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The diversification of our businesses across multiple commodities, the magnitude of our transportation and storage assets, the depth of our marketing activities, and our cost control efforts enabled us to generate distributable cash flow just 3% shy of the record DCF we earned in 2019. Good morning. Where is Chris, you want to answer it? Yes. This is Jim. The spreads are wide, but we don't have exposure to the total. I think we got exposure to about 30% of our capacity of that spread. So to the extent we have exposure, yes, we'll benefit. I'm not sure how much it'll make up. Are you sold out? Okay, we're going this as the Brent Secrest show. Brent? Go to your answer that you gave earlier. I think the power sourcing is from a wide variety of areas. Over the over the last number of years, if we look 10 years plus, we've been going more and more to electrical drivers as at our new facilities. The power is really sourced both from opportunistic, been able to go out and acquire solar power as well as the ERCOT grid provides a significant amount of renewable power. This is Jim. Brent pointing his finger to me, but I got more high points than him. So, Brent, you want to answer that question? Let's speak to the magnet you're building. Yes, Randy said it was going to be flattened and I endorsed that and it makes Justin Kleiderer nervous. So we'll turn it over to him. Yes, we typically don't talk about capital costs of specific projects. I will say this, that the projects, they're coming online, or all on time on budget. We also don't talk about returns of specific projects, a little bit for the same reason that we don't come in and are reluctant to talk about projects under development. We've got a lot of competitors on these calls and we just not to get into too much detail. In the earning support slides, we do provide a list of projects under development. Jackie, what page? So bear with me just a minute. Yes, when you when you come in and you look at the $1.6 billion that we expect to invest in capital projects in 2021, probably the PDH 2 represents about a third of it. Could you repeat the question please? It will be neutral to our current power costs. What's your pipeline? What's your contract position? Dexter, we have time for one more question from our audience. Eve, this is Jim. I'm not sure we can spell defense. We're always on the offense and we're working on some pretty exciting projects, recognizing that we need to be responsible about it. But we're looking at some pretty exciting things and Brent said, it takes years in the Permian. I'm a firm believer that price heals all ills and Tony is bullish on hydrocarbon prices in the future, but not as bullish as I am. And prices create supply. I think you're going to see -- I'm a believer in the Permian, I'm a believer in the Eagle Ford if you have federal land issues in New Mexico, we got a hell of a position in Eagle Ford, maybe be rigs go down there. So I feel pretty good about things, and I feel good about the things we're working on -- we said are out there, we're not going to talk about. Thank you, Eve. That ends our call today and the management team here at Enterprise really thanks you for joining us. We're going to leave the call now.

Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise's General Partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, based on the beliefs of the Company, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim. Okay. Thank you, Randy. Dexter, we are ready to take questions from our listeners. Yes, Shneur, I put that statement in there about opportunistic versus programmatic just to head off this question and I guess it didn't work. You asked a number of them there. The 2% target that we talked about for buybacks was really with respect to 2020. Coming in this year, again, we're getting into new territory in the second half of this year, as far as what we see now based on current expectations, where we'll be discretionary, free cash flow positive. And we just come back in, this has really been 2020 and even coming in here to 2021, has been a very dynamic environment with a lot of uncertainties. And boy, you can go down the list of sort of what the uncertainties are as we enter into this year and we're just not at a place we think it's premature to come in and provide any guidance on what we're going to do with returning capital, buybacks or distributions at this point in time. The distribution that we announced in January, I don't think that should have been a surprise to anybody. We've been increasing distributions 22 years in a row. So that shouldn't have been surprising. We talked about trying to keep purchase power priority  on our distribution. We don't have a lot of inflation, but we wanted to come in and go ahead and bump the distribution. But when it when it comes to the buyback, we just like to get a little bit more visibility for 2021."

            "name": "Brent Secrest",
            "content": "No, I think you covered it, Tony. In terms of some green shoots, we are seeing some private guys be more active out there with put more rigs in play. When we talk to our customers and I think the simple answer is we don't know what's going to happen. But when we talk to our customers, it feels like they have a timeline to go ahead and execute the permits that they have. And it's not a rush to go out there and get it done. So, it's kind of a case by case basis, depending on the producer, but I haven't sensed panic from talking to our customers. Yes, I mean, we're seeing, we saw ethane storage peak in the fourth quarter, we're seeing it roll off as crackers came back online. Ethane was a little bit of a challenge during the fourth quarter as ethane  trying to clean up. I think you know, I think we're fundamentally bullish. A lot of things as it relates to hydrocarbons, I think in terms of an outright price on ethane, I still think you have to have some sort of baseline gas call. But if you look at how this market balances with demand and supply on that day and if you look at the demand coming online, you hear what Tony says about supply from talking to our customers. And you're seeing it happen. We've seen it happen the last several weeks, ethane, has to work and go to work to go price to get back into the NGL stream. So, whether that means coming from further away, or whether that means that people have to adjust prices in the Permian Basin, we believe that these markets need to balance and I think fundamentally -- I read reports, Jeannie, and I don't know if we're going to see some numbers that I've read from you a month or two months back, but I think we're aligned that we're fairly bullish, I think. This is Brent again. We have a massive presence in NGLs. So, when price goes to work in NGLs, I think it's fair to assume that somehow enterprise participate in it. If you look at our volumes, I can speak specifically to enterprise. Our volumes for crude exports have gone down. So, the pandemic has taught us a lot of things and one thing that it has taught us is something that we've preached over the last several years, is that Houston truly is a market. I understand and I see the numbers, too, that there's a lot of barrels going out a Corpus. I recognize the fact is, once the train leaves the station in Midland and the heads to Corpus, it has to go to the water. What we offer in Houston is truly a market and the domestic price that our customers achieve in Houston is higher than the price that they can achieve on the water. And that's the reason they've elected to not take the barrel across the water. Now as enterprise from a profitability standpoint, I'd say we're somewhat agnostic to it, we can provide the service, we have no problem providing the service, but the domestic price in Houston is higher than Corpus. So, at some point, the market is going to require that barrel to go across the water once the global market needs that barrel. But right now, our customers are achieving a higher net back in Houston. So, you could see the volumes decline. But when it comes to revenue, frankly, our revenue stays flat. It will continue to stay flat for quite some time and then when we have to export, frankly, there's additional, expenses that you undertake from exporting. I think what we're seeing flown to Cushing, you guys could see the ARB  between Midland and the overcapacity build that's coming out of Midland. I think there are some barrels that this refinery complexes are going to want to go from Midland to Cushing. If you looked at volumes and what they've done month-over-month, they continue to go down. Much like most areas in this country, I would say there's too much pipeline capacity, going to Cushing. Now, how that pipeline capacity gets rationalized and how it gets repurposed, or what direction it flows, that remains to be seen. As far as Corpus in Houston, I'd argue, hey, they all work great when barrels are flowing and going straight to the water and there's no decision to make. There's a bunch of place that worked 15 months ago. In terms of what we offer to use in terms of the refining capacity, the access to from pipeline connectivity, if you look at the amount of storage of the Houston Gulf Coast versus Corpus, you're talking hundreds of millions of capacity taken in weather storms, like we saw in 2020, versus what they are for Corpus when you look at grades, what people can do with different grades, what the export customers want with different grades. And if you look at frankly, our announcement last week with Magellan, and working on a pricing point that there works frankly, for everybody, it works for producers, it should work for refiners, it should work for consumers. And in fact, there's transparency for people to go out and conduct their business long-term. Whether that's a hedge that they buy, or whether that's a hedge that they sell and then they can decide to execute on that, or they take it across the water or not -- but they don't have to take it across the water -- they can go sell it back in the market if the  doesn't work versus other ports where frankly, you have vessels floating around out there hoping the phone rings. Because once that phone rings and say, 'Hey, I need you,' then, frankly, the people, all they have to do is go beat the price in Midland. And I think that gets old after a while. This is going to work overtime as contracts roll off. We got some sticky contracts that people have and markets evolve over time and people learn lessons. In terms of our presence on barrels going from Midland to Cushing is very, very small. But you can sit there and probably look at pipeline flows that are going from Midland to Cushing and say, that is something that is incredibly overbuilt. This is Brent. I think with Wink to Webster, it's up right but it's going to continue to ramp up over the next several months. And so, we've seen this before Corpus' pipelines came on, took barrels from Houston. You look at the people involved with Wink to Webster, they're obviously going to go take barrels from pipelines that go to Corpus and all this stuff, when the tide starts rolling out, we'll find out who has contracts and who doesn't and what's sticky and what's not. So, I would expect barrels to decrease that are flown to corpus and roll over to Wink to Webster. There may be some pipelines that frankly, don't have contracts that are going to Houston that they may take from those pipelines. So, we've seen this happen over the last couple years. To Jim's question, what's our contract position and Brad Martell  is going to go into this endless meeting. But we got about a million barrels a day of committed contracts for crude oil that last, caught out to 2028 and beyond. So it's hard for me to say that we're going to have a bunch of discretionary barrels until the Permian Basin recovers and that's going to take years, but I feel when it comes to weathering the storm, we'll be okay. I fundamentally believe that capacity has to be rationalized. And there's different ways to do that. And you can be repurposed or inefficient operators can frankly figure out something else to do. Those assets shut down. But the industry as a whole has to properly figure this out. As far as the details that we look at, we're not going to go into it, but I think it's naive to assume that we don't look at figuring out how to solve some of these capacity issues that are existing in the market."

But the long and the short of it is if you look at what public producers are saying and what they're telling us, they plan on remaining flat in 2021. And flat being most of them couch it as where they exited 2020, where they plan on exiting 2021. And you are correct that the Permian is going to be the lion's share of the activity. That said, we are seeing some increase in activity and production in the Eagle Ford that we like to see. And then I guess, now, I'll move to the federal acreage comment. And it's early on to this. Brent may want to chime in, it's early on to this pronouncement from the Biden administration kind of two weeks into it. But when we look at the Permian acreage, and we back up and look at what we consider active acreage, it's nearly 15 million acres.  Only about 12% of that, as we gauge it is on federal land. And on that federal land, there's some approximately 2,000 permits probably more as we speak in 600 or 700 DUCs. What we're hearing from producers, I think, ramping and let me know if you feel differently, some are actually speeding up. Most are saying at this point, no change. And I would say few, if any, at this point said I'm laying a rig or two down because they're well permitted. They saw that it might come and that's where they're headed. There's a lot of political pushback. This is big for the state of New Mexico. And so, stay tuned. But when we look at it holistically, this is how we feel. Brent, did I miss anything?"

We retained around $669 million in the quarter now totaling $1.8 billion for the first nine months. Our businesses continue to perform well even as the U.S. and the world are still dealing with the COVID pandemic, the oil price crash and the ensuing oil inventory overhang. In addition to our integrated business model, our profits continue to be protected by a strong base of firm customer obligations coupled with our activities around our marketing and storage systems. The petrochemical industry is reporting strong demand for our products, especially ethylene, driven in part by individual serving-type products as the world deals with the pandemic. Propylene is also strong as strong demand manufacturer badly needed PPE. Bob Patel, the CEO of Lyondell probably said it best on their second quarter earnings call, when he said the pandemic has generated a renewed appreciation for the value of our chemical and polymer products for society. Total capital investments were $705 million in the third quarter and $2.7 billion for the first nine months of the year. During the third quarter, our commercial team responded to customer requests and changing industry conditions to amend agreements that enabled us to increase volume commitments over the long-term by utilizing existing pipeline capacity. We were able to cancel the Midland-to-ECHO 4 crude oil pipeline. In total, we have reduced our planned growth CapEx for 2020 and 2021 around $1.5 billion. We've also focused on cost control. In the first nine months of this year, Enterprise\u2019s operating costs were $260 million below budget and our sustaining capital expenditures for the year expected to be $100 million lower than our original budget. We are turning over every rock in order to manage cost, but we are doing so without sacrificing safety or reliability. And discussing our performance in capital reductions, I think it also goes without saying that our people matter. We are extremely proud of the way our folks have responded in the face of the pandemic and all the other chaos we've had this year. Early on in the pandemic, we went to a skeleton staff in our headquarters consisting of management, our marketing desk, and a few of our operations folks with everyone else working from home. We made adjustments to be able to open back up and protect our employees, including things like social distancing guidelines in common areas and installing plexiglass around the building. Biggest change we made was requiring face coverings at all times. We also had a steady stream of employee communications, including several that emphasized that none of these measures work unless each of us also take personal responsibility and the decisions we make when we are away from work. And I have to say our employees responded. Since the second half of June, I think that's right, Randy, we've been pretty much fully staffed in our offices and our case count has been minimal. Thanks to the safety measures put in place, and our people accepting personal responsibility. We don't believe that our performance would come close to matching today's announcement without the kind of collaboration that comes from actually being together, especially during times of chaos, which create their own opportunities. I am hard pressed to find a law firm back in the office. In the downtown company, someone recently told me, we were somewhat of an anomaly. I think that's anonymous with competitive advantage. Then came the storm. Luckily for most of you, the 2020 active hurricane system was nightly news. But for us, there were five major storms on the Gulf Coast. Three were hurricanes, one at category four, and now we've got another one on the way. All of these impacted our people, our operations and the operations of many of our customers. Loss of power in 2020 was a major event for people in businesses, especially refiners and petrochemicals along the upper Gulf Coast. So why aren't we talking about special charges or big earnings, it's related to what has been a historical Gulf hurricane season, again is because of our people. Some power outages in Louisiana lasted well over a month and we are appreciative to our engineering and operations personnel who planned for and quickly responded to these events. Time and, again, we have people who regardless of being impacted in their personal lives are still going to the extra mile to keep the assets they look after up and running. I\u2019ll spend a few minutes discussing our views of the global energy environment. Near-term, the global economy is reopening from a self-imposed sudden stop due to COVID-19. The pace of the recovery varies. But with the exception of air travel, much of Asia is returned to near normal, while U.S. and European energy demand still lags a little. Air traffic, particularly international travel continues to lag worldwide and several industries, refineries, airlines, hotels, restaurants need for business to get back to normal in order to really get the economies moving again. Apparently the development of vaccine is progressing rapidly. Meanwhile, treatment for the virus continues to take a giant leap. Even though the pace of the pandemic and the recovery is somewhat uncertain, the economic recovery thus far has led to a remarkable rebound and the demand for energy and energy products from the lows of the second quarter. We think it's pretty clear we are not going to shut the world down again and that not one, but several vaccines will soon be available. We've also been very outspoken that we believe a price signal for crude oil is coming. Given the combination of recovering demand worldwide and the base of record retrenchment and drilling and completion activities by U.S. producers with steep decline curves and the lack of oil and gas investment worldwide, we believe a price signal for higher crude oil prices could occur as early as the second half of next year. While the forward curves remain muted, we are really not alone in looking for a rebound. Finally, I'd like to cover our initiatives and sustainability and lower carbon energy. Jackie Richert and Libby Strait with the help from a lot of Enterprise for folks are responsible for our sustainability report that we published in July. And I think that we put on our website today, Jackie. Also, we recently \u2013 we put on our website today and investor deck dedicated our thoughts and actions on this topic. It's probably worth your time to take a look at it. I struggled with the term that I hear a lot energy transition. In my mind, energy evolution is more appropriate and that we are gradually moving to a world where renewables will compliment, but not replace oil and gas. We also understand that access to affordable reliable energy available at scale right now is what is going to continue to advance a higher quality of life worldwide. And energy evolution is underway and light hydrocarbons from the U.S. are already playing a key role in this evolution. World is still adding a billion people every 12 years and soon top of the population today of close to 8 billion and populations in developing countries wanting access to more convenient sources of energy. We believe demand for reliable U.S. energy, petrochemicals and related products will continue to grow. Without the U.S. shale light oil, NGLs, natural gas and our energy markets, the world is left relying on countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia, and they would again control the price of oil leading to a lesser quality of life for people at underdeveloped countries. It's clear from what's been going on at our docks that even in the middle of a pandemic, the world wants U.S. oil and gas. In addition to being what we believe is one of the global leaders in providing the world with new lighter liquid hydrocarbons, our businesses are making the substantial environmental contribution. For us, these aren't calculations in a model that make hypothetical future projections, and I think this comes out of the slide deck, some of these points, Jackie. We believe U.S. LPG exports could eliminate up to 20 million metric tons of CO2 emissions when compared to using coal, wood and animal waste for heating and cooking. We've made strong commitment to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of our operations with a 19% improvement and CO2 emissions per barrel of oil equivalent since 2011. We have over 16,000 micro solar installations along our pipelines, and approximately 17% of our purchase power comes from renewables. Last but not least, we are easily the largest midstream player in generating, consuming and marketing hydrogen from processes in our petrochemical plants, specifically iBDH and PDH. We estimate that with the completion of our second PDH facility in 2023, we will produce about 150 million cubic feet hydrogen, something over a 100 million of pure hydrogen. We use all of the hydrogen we can in our plants, and we sell the rest into the industrial gas market. We are really proud of this quarter. Last quarter, one of the sell-side analysts wrote, an Enterprise had a great quarter and no one cared. Well, we know our investors care. And even if the market doesn't care, I can assure you at Enterprise, we care. The Enterprise culture, we live by a motto that Dan's grandmother taught him. It's a simple motto, but it's what drives us. Do the best you can every day and that's what we are doing. And with that, I'll turn it over to Randy.\nRandall Fowler: Okay. Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I'd like to start with the income statement. Our net income attributable to common unitholders for the third quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion or $0.48 per unit on a fully diluted basis. And this compares to $0.46 per unit for the third quarter of 2019. When we adjust earnings for non-cash asset impairment charges, earnings per unit on a fully diluted basis was $0.51 for the third quarter of 2020 versus $0.48 for the third quarter of last year. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flows from operations were $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2019. Substantially, all of this decrease in cash flow from operations was due to cash used for working capital purposes. Based on current expectations, we believe our working capital usage peak during the third quarter. Free cash flow, which we defined as cash flow from operations minus investing activities plus contributions from joint venture partners was $430 million for the quarter, which again was impacted by the cash used for working capital purposes. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020. We defined payout ratio is the sum of cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from operations. Our payout ratio was 68% with respect to the trailing 12 months. If we normalize working capital uses, it was closer to 61%. We declared our distribution of $0.445 with respect to the third quarter, which will be paid November 12. The distribution is the same as the prior three quarters. As we stated on the last two quarterly calls, given the continued state of the macroeconomic backdrop, our Board elected to maintain the current distribution right and we will continue to evaluate any increase to the distribution on a quarterly basis. During the third quarter of 2020, we bought back an additional $34 million or 2 million common units under our buyback program. Year-to-date, we have bought back $174 million or 8.3 million common units, which equates to approximately 4% of year-to-date cash flow from operations. We exchanged another 1.1 million common units into preferred units in September 2020. Additionally, EPD\u2019s distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 33 million or approximately 1.8 million EPD common units in the open market during the third quarter. Year-to-date, these programs have purchased $104 million or approximately 5.1 million EPD common units on the open market. Now moving to capital investments. We have recently placed approximately 1.4 billion of assets into service since the last call and have another 4.1 billion of project still under construction. As Jim mentioned, our capital investments were $705 million during the third quarter, including $83 million for sustaining capital. For the nine months ended September 30, capital investments were $2.7 billion, which included $226 million of sustaining capital. We anticipate approximately $3.2 million in capital investments for 2020, which would include $300 million for sustaining capital expenditures. For 2021 and 2022, we currently anticipate growth capital investments to be approximately $1.6 billion and $800 million respectively. Our capital expenditure forecast excludes our proposed SPOT offshore crude oil terminal that is subject to government approvals, which we do not expect to receive this year. And turning to capitalization, our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $30 billion as of September 30, 2020. Assuming the first call date of our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio was 16.5 years. Assuming the final maturity date of the hybrids extends the life of the portfolio out to 20.6 years. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.4%. Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2020 was $8 billion, and our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.5x after adjusting debt for the partial equity credit of the hybrid debt securities by the debt rating agencies and further reduced for unrestricted cash. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $6 billion at September 30, including availability under our existing credit facilities and approximately $1 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. As mentioned, we likely reached peak use of working capital for the year in the third quarter, but anticipate somewhat elevated uses for the next quarter. On allocation of capital, beginning with the fourth quarter, we currently expect, as I mentioned, some of the cash flow from operations that has been used for working capital purposes will begin to reverse and will become a source of cash flow from operations. Based on current expectations this should continue to reverse in 2021. How much it reverses or frankly how much we may redeploy will ultimately depend on the opportunities we see in 2021. In addition, the magnitude of EPD\u2019s discretionary cash flow for 2021 and 2022 will depend on our earnings and the continuing recovery of the global economy and energy demand. It will also depend on the permitting of SPOT. These factors and where we are relative to our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage target will ultimately drive our Board's decision with regard to the mix of how we would return discretionary free cash flow to our investors through buybacks, distributions and debt retirements. With that, Randy, I think we can open it up for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay. Thank you, Randy. Branna, we are ready to take questions from our listeners.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Jeremy Tonet. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJames Teague: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: I just wanted to start off with the \u2013 on the last point that you touched on there. With the reduction of CapEx next year, we see some real notable positive free cash flow generation. And just wondering, how do you think about deploying that as far as setting kind of formal ties to free cash flow, if that's something that you might look to do. Is it fair to think that acquisitions are less likely, did you look at Dow selling those assets to Vopak? Just wanted to touch based on that side. Should we think about the positive SCF more going towards buybacks versus other uses at this point? Just trying to dig in a little bit more.\nRandall Fowler: Okay. Jeremy, I'll handle the first part of that question on capital allocation. Then, Jim will speak to the M&A aspects of it. I think one, coming in and go into a formulaic approach seems to be pretty restrictive. And just because there are so many variables that we consider and that could influence how we would come in and allocate capital. So I think to a degree we really need to \u2013 it's probably not appropriate to try to speculate right now on what we might see on all of these variables next year. I think we would rather come in and take a look at what the factset looks like in 2021 as we continue to see economic recovery. And then at that time, see what makes the most sense as far as how we allocate capital at the margin. Jim?\nJames Teague: You gave me maybe good part. Yes. We look at a lot of opportunities that come in \u2013 they come through the front door down the air every week. We haven't seen any. That makes sense for us. And we did not look at the assets that Dow sells.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just want to touch on ethane supply demand there possible, how much ethane rejection do you currently see and how much potential ethane is recoverable at these production levels and how do you see a demand trending overtime here, given kind of all the cracker additions this year, as well as kind of downtime to get the hurricanes and some of those returning? Thanks.\nJames Teague: What do you think, Randy and Justin or Brent, you want to take the lead on that?\nAnthony Chovanec: I'll start \u2013 this is Tony. Ethane rejection has been all over the map, call it year-to-date, variable on things that have been pushing and pulling on it, or storms, price of natural gas, price of ethane. So it's been highly volatile, but let's call it, 500 to 1 million barrels just depend on when you look at it. And on the day, I'm sorry, but I can't respond to your number. Again, it just depends on what's happening with gas prices in any area of the country. Relative to trends, maybe Randy or Justin would want to talk about how you see ethane market balancers.\nRandall Fowler: Yes. I mean, assuming we get back to some normal ethane demand outlook going into 2021, I mean, I think with what our supply picture looks like, you're going to get to a point where as we get more balanced on ethane, ethane has to be incentivized to be recovered at further away places. And so I think generally that's how you start to paint a more constructive view of ethane. But as Tony alluded to, outlier events like hurricanes that take a lot of demand offline can throw a wrench in that base case.\nBrent Secrest: This is Brent. There's probably going to be questions about the supply and what happens in 2021. And there's probably some downsides to that, but one of the positives is certainly ethane for 2021.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Your line is now open.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Glad to see everyone is well. Maybe we can start off on the cost control items that you talked about in your press release and highlighted in your prepared remarks. I was just wondering if you can talk us through how sustainable these cost reductions are. And then secondly, are you just scratching the surface on these costs reductions and optimization opportunities? Is there a trend where we can see more and more of this over the coming quarters? Just trying to understand and see if we can, a) how sustainable it is, and is there a potential, let's say to remove another $200 million from the cost structure?\nGraham Bacon: Yes. This is Graham. In terms of the sustainability, there's a good portion of them that are sustainable. Some of them are \u2013 I don\u2019t have the percentages right off the top of my head, but probably a mix of sustainable reductions as well as some that just \u2013 some short-term deferrals into next year. But when we look at the trends over time and our operating costs, operating as we've continued to bring on new assets, our overall cost structure has continued to improve year-on-year. The point that you look back at three or four years ago, and our cost structure today is where it was then even \u2013 the assets that we've brought on. We've continued to maintain cost inline with years, three or four years ago. So I think, Jim hit on it. We continue to turn over every rock and work to get better every day and managing our cost and improving our reliability. We've got a lot of good engineering talent. Some of that's being redeployed from capital projects to focused on cost reduction as we've responded to growth. And I think we're going to continue to work that. So I think probably 50% to 60% of those are probably sustainable costs.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay, great. Appreciate that. And maybe as a follow-up and just start to continue on Jeremy\u2019s question on return of capital opportunities. Randy, I recognized the reluctance to set a formal target out there and so forth, but you kind of have a 2% of CFFO target out there. You have the CapEx stepping down next year. Any thoughts around maybe taking that to 5% or 10% as a target? And then secondly, when I start to think about the $3.9 billion annual distribution payment, if you lower your unit count, by say 10% through buybacks, the claim on cash flows would fall by 10% or $400 million. And so I guess kind of the second part of my question is, given that your \u2013 which is at a very comfortable level right now, would you consider temporarily taking up your leverage, let's say by a quarter turn to permanently reduce your distribution cash outflow. And I can imagine that that would be credit enhancing over the long run. Just kind of curious on your thoughts, both inside the box and outside the box, in terms of ways to reduce the unit count outstanding.\nRandall Fowler: Shneur, I congratulate you for that follow-up question. You turned in about five or six. Yes, let me see if I can address some of that. You're right, at the beginning of the year, frankly, pre-pandemic, we came in and said, we would use 2% of our cash flow from operations to come in on buybacks. And we've surpassed that year-to-date. We're at 4%. I think again, coming into 2021, we do have a substantially lower growth CapEx budget going into next year. And frankly, really don't see \u2013 there maybe a couple of projects out there, but we've really raised the return rate on our project. So really, for the most part, maybe don't see that growing that much. So I think it will put us in a position where we'll have a more discretionary cash flow next year. But again, trying to come in now and pre-commit on how we might come in and spend that. I think there are too many unknowns. Coming into this year, we actually had some investors that were promoting the idea of taking leverage up $2 billion to do a buyback program. And we did not want to come in again, that would take us above our 3.5x area debt-to-EBITDA leverage target. And thank goodness, we didn't follow that advice. And because we had the pandemic come and with the volatility that that caused, we were able to come in and maintain our financial flexibility, which is important to us. So again, I think as we get out into next year, we see where our opportunities are, we see how the business is performing, how the world is coming in and handling the \u2013 hopefully what maybe the second half of this pandemic on COVID. We don't see the world doing another shutdown like it did last time. I don't think there's popular support of shutdowns in any country. So we think the economy maybe more resilient, but we really just need to get into next year and get to see what the factset is again, next year and then we'll make a decision then. And frankly it may \u2013 I think we're pretty flexible and pretty nimble in our decision making, so that we could come in and make that decision quarter-to-quarter.\nShneur Gershuni: Perfect. Really appreciate the color today, guys. And glad to hear everyone is safe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine Cho of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nChristine Cho: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So maybe I can start with the cancellation of Midland-to-ECHO 4. Even though you've taken that off, there's still over capacity in the region. Do you think this sector will just continue to struggle until we get to a point in time when production approaches the capacity levels in that region? Or is there a need for the different operators to come together to rationalize capacity in the near-term, whether it's idling up pipe and taking the volumes over to another pipe where UGI or something like that? Or are there things that preclude that from really making sense.\nJames Teague: You want to take a shot, Brent?\nBrent Secrest: Yes, this is Brent. So I think a lot of those conversations are probably happening more often than they have in the past in terms of what's the right thing for the industry. I feel like as Enterprise, we're in a good position just in terms of how we've contracted and the length of those contracts. There was probably concessions on both sides for the M2E4 piece, but I think that was a win-win solution for both parties involved there. But it's hard to argue that there's not excess capacity come on the Permian for crude oil. So the take-or-pay contracts are the ones that are going to move. When it starts going above those types of volumes, it's tough to move a whole lot of spot volumes unless you're extremely, extremely competitive versus other markets. So I think everybody is trying to be creative and I can tell you as an Enterprise, we probably spend more time trying to figure out how to optimize and be strategic than we have in the past. As much as I thought, we\u2019re trying to do that. I just think as an industry, there's an issue and there's contracts out there and other folks are moving just kind of spot volumes, and that's a tough business right now.\nJames Teague: Brent, are you fully contracted on your pipeline capacity, if not\u2026\nBrent Secrest: Yes. I mean, if you look at, in terms of what we look at as fully contracted, there's always excess capacity, that's pretty expensive capacity. And every pipeline has as a curve where the costs start going up. But in terms of what we have that we can efficiently move or fully contracted, and our contracts don't start rolling off until 2027. So I kind of like our position in terms of where the pipeline goes. The market has access to, the docks has access to, all that helps differentiate midstream crude service providers.\nChristine Cho: Okay. So it sounds like even if someone wanted to come to you with their volumes, you don't even have the capacity to share.\nBrent Secrest: I don't think we ever tell people no, we'll figure out a way to do something.\nChristine Cho: Okay. Fair enough. And then there's been a wave of M&A at the upstream level with a lot of focus on Permian. Do you guys have any initial thoughts you can share with us on the impact on midstream, and specifically if there is any opportunity to bring more incremental volumes onto your system, or has everything pretty much already been dedicated?\nJames Teague: This is Jim. I think consolidation in the upstream is probably over the long-haul. Very good for the industry and frankly good for Enterprise. We like dealing with major players and this just gives \u2013 I think this fits our wheelhouse. I think it's necessary. And I think it's not over.\nChristine Cho: Okay. Jim you were sure to say over those long-term, does that mean you think it's \u2013 there's going to be some near-term headwind?\nJames Teague: I think there could be some headwinds for those who are not fully contracted.\nChristine Cho: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from [Yves Siegel of Siegel Asset Management]. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, everybody, and thank you. Quick two observations. One is really compliment you on the ESG initiative. Jackie and team did a great job preparing the slide deck. So it's the right thing to do and investors really want to see that initiative. So congratulations there. The second quick observation is, I think the winners in midstream will be the best allocators of capital and you've distinguished yourself in that regard. So the question is, which came up before as you think of deploying capital and you think of M&A, and you think of stock buybacks. Yes, how do you compare the two, especially from a risk profile because clearly a large M&A deal implies risk buying back your stock doesn't, and then how do you think of discrete assets versus M&A to Jim's point of evolution in the industry and the consolidation in the upstream? When does it happen in the midstream? Thanks.\nJames Teague: Why don\u2019t you take a shot first?\nRandall Fowler: Yes. I'm going to take the easy part of that one, and then I'll give it back to Jim. Appreciate the comment. Some of it \u2013 it's somewhat \u2013 we have been \u2013 Enterprise has been public since 1998 and we've been very disciplined and deliberate the way we've come in and spent our capital. And some of it was management owning 30% to 33% of the limited partner units outstanding. We eat our own cooking. So it's not about a promote on limited partners, we're all in this thing together. So I think, we are careful and where we spend capital and it's in the projects or acquisitions that we believe in for the long-term not the short-term, but the long-term. As far as whole company M&A or discreet M&A, I\u2019ll turn that over to Jim.\nJames Teague: Yes. Like I said earlier, Yves, I don't see anything that makes a hell of a lot of sense right now. I do think if you look at where we have trended in terms of the CapEx that we do spend. To Randy's point, we've really been disciplined that it's got to fit a value chain. So it's not \u2013 you're not going to see us just go out and build something. It's got to add to what we already have. And if you look at our CapEx for next year, I think Randy over 50% is in the petrochemical sector. So I mean, you get a pretty good idea of what we're doing. I think, we have a deal in principle that sells out, I think, PDH 2, Chris. Is that right? No pressure, buddy. The other thing I think we are so well positioned from an export perspective. It's not funny. Our LPG exports have not come up at all in the middle of this pandemic. So I think it is \u2013 we see how we are going to do projects, it's got to fit what we already have, and it's been like that since 1998.\nRandall Fowler: And then, Yves, the last part of that, I'll come in, when you come in and look at the unit price and whether you want to come in and look at 10% of distribution yield, or if you want to come in and look at what 15%, 16% of cash flow yield, that is a \u2013 I mean, it is a very compelling return that we see on buybacks. And we stated earlier this year on a couple of these calls that again, with the capital expenditures we have this year, we would be moderate in coming in and doing unit buybacks. And we have done that, but we've doubled what we said we were going to do. And then as we come into next year, again, we\u2019ve come in and \u2013 when it comes in and looks on the M&A side, whether it's whole company or discrete assets, we've not seen anything compelling out there. So again, as we continue to see the unit price at attractive levels, that'll be a good area to go with allocation of capital. The one thing you think about is, we're a midstream company and when you come in and you make investments that we think are durable over the long-term, you're growing your EBITDA, you're growing your assets footprint, you're growing the value of the company to your customers and to your owners where the \u2013 coming in and just looking at a buyback, you are reducing the size of the company and \u2013 or not growing it, I should say. So I mean, we'll look at both of those. And like I said, where the unit price is currently trading based on the distribution yield, very attractive right now.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. So I appreciate all of that, but the quick follow-up is would you agree that consolidation in the midstream space has to happen, especially following the consolidation in the upstream, and from a strategic perspective are you fine with letting competitors consolidate the industry?\nJames Teague: This is Jim here. When we look at \u2013 we've got a pretty big footprint aids. So when we look at whole company M&A, in many respects, what we would want to buy, we'd have to sell them everything we bought because the FTC wouldn't allow it. So we're going to be limited, I think. Randy, you kick-in. We're going to be limited and our ability to consolidate, given the footprint we have and antitrust issues that we would end up having. And trust me, we've looked at a lot of companies and there are companies out there that I personally would love to have, but there's no way we can do it because we'd sell everything we bought. Is that fair, Randy?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Okay. Thanks guys. And Jim, I'd like to discuss that offline. I love to know what companies you would love to buy.\nJames Teague: I bet you already know.\nRandall Fowler: And honestly some of the M&A gets back to where the unit prices and the cash flow yield of our units. The way we view our equity currency as far as from an M&A standpoint, it's really expensive currency right now from an M&A standpoint. So I think that's another element that enters into the thought process.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jean Salisbury of Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nJean Salisbury: Good morning. Just one more on Permian crude. We thought it was a great decision to cancel ME4 and extend existing contracts. Can you provide any more disclosure around how much you added to the average duration of contracts out of the Permian from doing that?\nJames Teague: This is Jim. Thinking the neighborhood, and Brent, at five years.\nJean Salisbury: And just as a quick follow-up. Can you remind us of how much EBITDA exposure you have to the Eagle Ford? And I think there was a fair amount of MBC that underlied the Eagle Ford exposure, but if you could just refresh me on that?\nRandall Fowler: Brent or James, somebody.\nBrent Secrest: This contract will roll off. And there's some that rolled off this year. There's some that roll off next year. And then I'd say the bigger contracts roll off in 2022.\nJames Teague: But we've done some work and restructuring some of those deals to extend the time and make those producers more competitive. So I mean, in every case, you talked about M-to-E 4, there's not a system that we have that we're not trying to shore up for the long-term.\nJean Salisbury: Thanks. And in terms of EBITDA exposure, is 5% to 10% of your EBITDA is an estimate?\nRandall Fowler: Yes. I don't have the calculated number in front of me, but just thinking about it, I think we're in low-single digits.\nJean Salisbury: Great. Thanks. That's all for me.\nOperator: Your next question is from Tristan Richardson of Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTristan Richardson: Hi, good morning. I appreciate all the overview of what you're seeing across the spectrum in this recovery and then also for the multi-year outlook on capital. Just a question there, should we think of the 2022 expectation largely is the remainder of project budget for PDH 2? And then also to the extent the recovery accelerates and/or crude price response drives any rebound in production, could we expect a movement in capital upward as a result?\nRandall Fowler: Yes. I believe that the 2022, the significant part of that is the runoff on PDH 2. There maybe a couple of other projects that would be completed in that year. I mean, also that's complete in 2022. As far as if we come back in and see a production rebound, I think we've still got some pretty good operating leverage in our assets currently. So we'll have to see what kind of \u2013 what the rebound looks like, but I think we have some flexibility in our existing assets.\nTristan Richardson: Helpful. Randy, thank you. And then the follow-up was really around the supply side. Could you talk a little bit about what the earnings power of Enterprise is to the extent we stay sort of in a range bound crude environment, particularly as all the market dislocations this year really offered a lot of outside spread opportunities.\nRandall Fowler: All I could do is just tell you, I\u2019ll come back in. 2019 was a record year for us, and we reported about $8.3 billion worth of gross operating margin, which is pretty close to EBITDA. And if you come in and look at LTM last 12 months through the third quarter, it's nine months of this year and a month of last year, we're still around. I'd say we're \u2013 the variance from that $8.3 billion is probably maybe less than 5%. So it's been pretty durable in here.\nTristan Richardson: Thank you guys very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Pearce Hammond of Simmons Energy. Your line is open.\nPearce Hammond: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I'm just curious, what do you see is the major puts and takes driving EBITDA next year for Enterprise. And can you provide any guard rails around the 2021 outlook?\nJames Teague: You start and I\u2019ll finish.\nRandall Fowler: Okay. One, it\u2019s our practice not to give guidance, but I think \u2013 at the high level, I think what we're going to continue to \u2013 what we'll see is hopefully a continuation of what we've seen really coming back since June is a recovery in energy demand globally. Jim mentioned our LPG export demand has remained resilient even through the second quarter. And we're seeing a rebound in refined products demand of the troughs of where we were \u2013 maybe back within 10% of where we were on that demand. Petrochemical demand has remained resilient. We think it will continue to rebound now that we're seeing, and it's transitioning. A little bit of what you saw during the summer months was PPE needs were coming in and filling the void to the extent of some of the more durable plastics that we're going in the manufacturing processes. But now that you see more manufacturing facilities crank up whether it's for [Tesla\u2019s] or aircraft or whatever it is, you're seeing more demand pull for those durable plastics that come from that propylene chain. Actually one of the facts \u2013 that\u2019s what we heard the other day is that you're seeing more demand for tires. All that tire demand is synthetic rubber. So that gets into more your [indiscernible] and butane value chain. So you're seeing demand pull there. So we would think demand recovery should continue. And then I think we're \u2013 given where completion crews are, we could come in and see depending on the basin, you could come in and see lower production numbers from certain basins, some are going to be more impacted than other basins. We're glad we're in the Permian because we think it'll be resilient, but it'll have its headwinds on production as well. And then some of it as far as how we might see the supply side rebound is going to come in and it's going to be a function of where is that global energy demand. How does that recover? What are we going to see on the production front? And the timing of this price signal.\nJames Teague: Yes. To put it simply, price creates demand. We think price will create demand as we come out of this pandemic and price creates supply. So what we said in our script, we see \u2013 for all of the reasons that Randy said, we see a price signal coming. That doesn't mean the volume follows it immediately, but it ultimately would.\nRandall Fowler: I think that's why a number of companies actually who practice it is to give guidance, haven\u2019t given guidance just because of the uncertainty of the timing on some of the recovery. And so it's hard to be real specific on your question because again, there are so many variables.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you, guys. I could clearly understand, and congrats on a great quarter.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ujjwal Pradhan of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, Jim, appreciate your comments around potential signals for higher oil prices next year, which I think are very constructive. And as you also alluded forward oil prices remain muted and I think the forward WTI prices still remain below $45 level through 2025. So from EPD\u2019s perspective, what oil price levels are you assuming in this timeframe in evaluating your future plans? And maybe perhaps if you could share from your perspective what price level is needed for meaningful volume rebound.\nJames Teague: I think the question is what price level do producers need? I think they're going to be \u2013 I think this consolidation we\u2019re seeing is also going to lead to more discipline and the more disciplined that these producers are, I think the more constructive price will be.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it.\nJames Teague: If you're asking me for a number, you know you're not going to get it.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it. I appreciate that. And secondly, regards to your comments on energy transition opportunities. I appreciate the details around renewables involvement as well as the hydrogen topic. In this regard, have you explored doing more as part of your future investments in renewables?\nJames Teague: I think if we looked at it, yes, we see an immediate opportunity, no. And I think first and foremost any of these things \u2013 first, they got to be economic. And I think this one is going to take a while to develop and we'll see where it goes.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it. Thanks for that.\nRandall Fowler: Branna, this is Randy. We have time for one more question. We can take from our listeners.\nOperator: Okay, sir. Your next question is from Gabe Moreen of Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nGabriel Moreen: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting me in. Just a question on some of the JV negotiations, I think you've talked to in prior quarters, are any of those discussions still alive and ongoing? Just looking for an update?\nJames Teague: I think they're not nearly as strong as we thought they would be primarily because people are retrenching. But the other side of it is, some of these projects that we were looking at, we've been able to do contracts that I think give us a better return than doing a joint venture. So right now, I think we have discussions with one company going on. I'm not sure where it's going to go. They're retrenching.\nGabriel Moreen: Got it. Thanks Jim. And then question, I guess, in terms of sort of the spread income for this year. Randy, I'm just curious about the $600 million to $700 million, I think last quarter, you mentioned being towards the upper end. It seems like the working capital use from our perspective is greater than we expected, or maybe longer than expected. Can you talk about where you are in that $600 million to $700 million range? And also to what extent some of that spread income may, I guess be realized in 2021 as well? Does anything go out that far?\nRandall Fowler: Yes, Gabe. I think on the $600 million to $700 million, I think we're still sort of comfortable with that range. There maybe some that go into 2021, but the majority of it will be realized this year.\nGabriel Moreen: Great. Thank you.\nJames Teague: Okay. Branna before you give our replay information to our listeners, we'd like to thank everyone for joining our call today, and we're going to sign off as a company right now, but Branna, if you would give them the replay information. Thank you.\nOperator: The replay will be available two hours after the call has ended. Please dial this numbers (800) 585-8367 or (855) 859-2056 and enter the conference ID to listen. And for the participants outside of U.S., please dial (404) 537-3406 and enter the conference ID to listen. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "Randall Fowler",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I'd like to start with the income statement. Our net income attributable to common unitholders for the third quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion or $0.48 per unit on a fully diluted basis. And this compares to $0.46 per unit for the third quarter of 2019. When we adjust earnings for non-cash asset impairment charges, earnings per unit on a fully diluted basis was $0.51 for the third quarter of 2020 versus $0.48 for the third quarter of last year. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flows from operations were $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2019. Substantially, all of this decrease in cash flow from operations was due to cash used for working capital purposes. Based on current expectations, we believe our working capital usage peak during the third quarter. Free cash flow, which we defined as cash flow from operations minus investing activities plus contributions from joint venture partners was $430 million for the quarter, which again was impacted by the cash used for working capital purposes. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020. We defined payout ratio is the sum of cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from operations. Our payout ratio was 68% with respect to the trailing 12 months. If we normalize working capital uses, it was closer to 61%. We declared our distribution of $0.445 with respect to the third quarter, which will be paid November 12. The distribution is the same as the prior three quarters. As we stated on the last two quarterly calls, given the continued state of the macroeconomic backdrop, our Board elected to maintain the current distribution right and we will continue to evaluate any increase to the distribution on a quarterly basis. During the third quarter of 2020, we bought back an additional $34 million or 2 million common units under our buyback program. Year-to-date, we have bought back $174 million or 8.3 million common units, which equates to approximately 4% of year-to-date cash flow from operations. We exchanged another 1.1 million common units into preferred units in September 2020. Additionally, EPD's distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 33 million or approximately 1.8 million EPD common units in the open market during the third quarter. Year-to-date, these programs have purchased $104 million or approximately 5.1 million EPD common units on the open market. Now moving to capital investments. We have recently placed approximately 1.4 billion of assets into service since the last call and have another 4.1 billion of project still under construction. As Jim mentioned, our capital investments were $705 million during the third quarter, including $83 million for sustaining capital. For the nine months ended September 30, capital investments were $2.7 billion, which included $226 million of sustaining capital. We anticipate approximately $3.2 million in capital investments for 2020, which would include $300 million for sustaining capital expenditures. For 2021 and 2022, we currently anticipate growth capital investments to be approximately $1.6 billion and $800 million respectively. Our capital expenditure forecast excludes our proposed SPOT offshore crude oil terminal that is subject to government approvals, which we do not expect to receive this year. And turning to capitalization, our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $30 billion as of September 30, 2020. Assuming the first call date of our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio was 16.5 years. Assuming the final maturity date of the hybrids extends the life of the portfolio out to 20.6 years. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.4%. Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2020 was $8 billion, and our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.5x after adjusting debt for the partial equity credit of the hybrid debt securities by the debt rating agencies and further reduced for unrestricted cash. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $6 billion at September 30, including availability under our existing credit facilities and approximately $1 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. As mentioned, we likely reached peak use of working capital for the year in the third quarter, but anticipate somewhat elevated uses for the next quarter. On allocation of capital, beginning with the fourth quarter, we currently expect, as I mentioned, some of the cash flow from operations that has been used for working capital purposes will begin to reverse and will become a source of cash flow from operations. Based on current expectations this should continue to reverse in 2021. How much it reverses or frankly how much we may redeploy will ultimately depend on the opportunities we see in 2021. In addition, the magnitude of EPD's discretionary cash flow for 2021 and 2022 will depend on our earnings and the continuing recovery of the global economy and energy demand. It will also depend on the permitting of SPOT. These factors and where we are relative to our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage target will ultimately drive our Board's decision with regard to the mix of how we would return discretionary free cash flow to our investors through buybacks, distributions and debt retirements. With that, Randy, I think we can open it up for questions. Okay. Jeremy, I'll handle the first part of that question on capital allocation. Then, Jim will speak to the M&A aspects of it. I think one, coming in and go into a formulaic approach seems to be pretty restrictive. And just because there are so many variables that we consider and that could influence how we would come in and allocate capital. So I think to a degree we really need to \u2013 it's probably not appropriate to try to speculate right now on what we might see on all of these variables next year. I think we would rather come in and take a look at what the factset looks like in 2021 as we continue to see economic recovery. And then at that time, see what makes the most sense as far as how we allocate capital at the margin. Jim? Yes. I mean, assuming we get back to some normal ethane demand outlook going into 2021, I mean, I think with what our supply picture looks like, you're going to get to a point where as we get more balanced on ethane, ethane has to be incentivized to be recovered at further away places. And so I think generally that's how you start to paint a more constructive view of ethane. But as Tony alluded to, outlier events like hurricanes that take a lot of demand offline can throw a wrench in that base case. Shneur, I congratulate you for that follow-up question. You turned in about five or six. Yes, let me see if I can address some of that. You're right, at the beginning of the year, frankly, pre-pandemic, we came in and said, we would use 2% of our cash flow from operations to come in on buybacks. And we've surpassed that year-to-date. We're at 4%. I think again, coming into 2021, we do have a substantially lower growth CapEx budget going into next year. And frankly, really don't see \u2013 there maybe a couple of projects out there, but we've really raised the return rate on our project. So really, for the most part, maybe don't see that growing that much. So I think it will put us in a position where we'll have a more discretionary cash flow next year. But again, trying to come in now and pre-commit on how we might come in and spend that. I think there are too many unknowns. Coming into this year, we actually had some investors that were promoting the idea of taking leverage up $2 billion to do a buyback program. And we did not want to come in again, that would take us above our 3.5x area debt-to-EBITDA leverage target. And thank goodness, we didn't follow that advice. And because we had the pandemic come and with the volatility that that caused, we were able to come in and maintain our financial flexibility, which is important to us. So again, I think as we get out into next year, we see where our opportunities are, we see how the business is performing, how the world is coming in and handling the \u2013 hopefully what maybe the second half of this pandemic on COVID. We don't see the world doing another shutdown like it did last time. I don't think there's popular support of shutdowns in any country. So we think the economy maybe more resilient, but we really just need to get into next year and get to see what the factset is again, next year and then we'll make a decision then. And frankly it may \u2013 I think we're pretty flexible and pretty nimble in our decision making, so that we could come in and make that decision quarter-to-quarter. Yes. I'm going to take the easy part of that one, and then I'll give it back to Jim. Appreciate the comment. Some of it \u2013 it's somewhat \u2013 we have been \u2013 Enterprise has been public since 1998 and we've been very disciplined and deliberate the way we've come in and spent our capital. And some of it was management owning 30% to 33% of the limited partner units outstanding. We eat our own cooking. So it's not about a promote on limited partners, we're all in this thing together. So I think, we are careful and where we spend capital and it's in the projects or acquisitions that we believe in for the long-term not the short-term, but the long-term. As far as whole company M&A or discreet M&A, I'll turn that over to Jim. And then, Yves, the last part of that, I'll come in, when you come in and look at the unit price and whether you want to come in and look at 10% of distribution yield, or if you want to come in and look at what 15%, 16% of cash flow yield, that is a \u2013 I mean, it is a very compelling return that we see on buybacks. And we stated earlier this year on a couple of these calls that again, with the capital expenditures we have this year, we would be moderate in coming in and doing unit buybacks. And we have done that, but we've doubled what we said we were going to do. And then as we come into next year, again, we've come in and \u2013 when it comes in and looks on the M&A side, whether it's whole company or discrete assets, we've not seen anything compelling out there. So again, as we continue to see the unit price at attractive levels, that'll be a good area to go with allocation of capital. The one thing you think about is, we're a midstream company and when you come in and you make investments that we think are durable over the long-term, you're growing your EBITDA, you're growing your assets footprint, you're growing the value of the company to your customers and to your owners where the \u2013 coming in and just looking at a buyback, you are reducing the size of the company and \u2013 or not growing it, I should say. So I mean, we'll look at both of those. And like I said, where the unit price is currently trading based on the distribution yield, very attractive right now. And honestly some of the M&A gets back to where the unit prices and the cash flow yield of our units. The way we view our equity currency as far as from an M&A standpoint, it's really expensive currency right now from an M&A standpoint. So I think that's another element that enters into the thought process. Brent or James, somebody. Yes. I don't have the calculated number in front of me, but just thinking about it, I think we're in low-single digits. Yes. I believe that the 2022, the significant part of that is the runoff on PDH 2. There maybe a couple of other projects that would be completed in that year. I mean, also that's complete in 2022. As far as if we come back in and see a production rebound, I think we've still got some pretty good operating leverage in our assets currently. So we'll have to see what kind of \u2013 what the rebound looks like, but I think we have some flexibility in our existing assets. All I could do is just tell you, I'll come back in. 2019 was a record year for us, and we reported about $8.3 billion worth of gross operating margin, which is pretty close to EBITDA. And if you come in and look at LTM last 12 months through the third quarter, it's nine months of this year and a month of last year, we're still around. I'd say we're \u2013 the variance from that $8.3 billion is probably maybe less than 5%. So it's been pretty durable in here. Okay. One, it's our practice not to give guidance, but I think \u2013 at the high level, I think what we're going to continue to \u2013 what we'll see is hopefully a continuation of what we've seen really coming back since June is a recovery in energy demand globally. Jim mentioned our LPG export demand has remained resilient even through the second quarter. And we're seeing a rebound in refined products demand of the troughs of where we were \u2013 maybe back within 10% of where we were on that demand. Petrochemical demand has remained resilient. We think it will continue to rebound now that we're seeing, and it's transitioning. A little bit of what you saw during the summer months was PPE needs were coming in and filling the void to the extent of some of the more durable plastics that we're going in the manufacturing processes.

We're glad we're in the Permian because we think it'll be resilient, but it'll have its headwinds on production as well. And then some of it as far as how we might see the supply side rebound is going to come in and it's going to be a function of where is that global energy demand. How does that recover? What are we going to see on the production front? And the timing of this price signal. I think that's why a number of companies actually who practice it is to give guidance, haven't given guidance just because of the uncertainty of the timing on some of the recovery. And so it's hard to be real specific on your question because again, there are so many variables. Branna, this is Randy. We have time for one more question. We can take from our listeners. Yes, Gabe. I think on the $600 million to $700 million, I think we're still sort of comfortable with that range. There maybe some that go into 2021, but the majority of it will be realized this year."

Some of them are \u2013 I don't have the percentages right off the top of my head, but probably a mix of sustainable reductions as well as some that just \u2013 some short-term deferrals into next year. But when we look at the trends over time and our operating costs, operating as we've continued to bring on new assets, our overall cost structure has continued to improve year-on-year. The point that you look back at three or four years ago, and our cost structure today is where it was then even \u2013 the assets that we've brought on. We've continued to maintain cost inline with years, three or four years ago. So I think, Jim hit on it. We continue to turn over every rock and work to get better every day and managing our cost and improving our reliability. We've got a lot of good engineering talent. Some of that's being redeployed from capital projects to focused on cost reduction as we've responded to growth. And I think we're going to continue to work that. So I think probably 50% to 60% of those are probably sustainable costs."

            "name": "James Teague",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. In the third quarter, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion compared to $2 billion for the same quarter last year. Our DCF totaled $1.6 billion and provided a solid 1.7x coverage. We retained around $669 million in the quarter now totaling $1.8 billion for the first nine months. Our businesses continue to perform well even as the U.S. and the world are still dealing with the COVID pandemic, the oil price crash and the ensuing oil inventory overhang. In addition to our integrated business model, our profits continue to be protected by a strong base of firm customer obligations coupled with our activities around our marketing and storage systems. The petrochemical industry is reporting strong demand for our products, especially ethylene, driven in part by individual serving-type products as the world deals with the pandemic. Propylene is also strong as strong demand manufacturer badly needed PPE. Bob Patel, the CEO of Lyondell probably said it best on their second quarter earnings call, when he said the pandemic has generated a renewed appreciation for the value of our chemical and polymer products for society. Total capital investments were $705 million in the third quarter and $2.7 billion for the first nine months of the year. During the third quarter, our commercial team responded to customer requests and changing industry conditions to amend agreements that enabled us to increase volume commitments over the long-term by utilizing existing pipeline capacity. We were able to cancel the Midland-to-ECHO 4 crude oil pipeline. In total, we have reduced our planned growth CapEx for 2020 and 2021 around $1.5 billion. We've also focused on cost control. In the first nine months of this year, Enterprise's operating costs were $260 million below budget and our sustaining capital expenditures for the year expected to be $100 million lower than our original budget. We are turning over every rock in order to manage cost, but we are doing so without sacrificing safety or reliability. And discussing our performance in capital reductions, I think it also goes without saying that our people matter. We are extremely proud of the way our folks have responded in the face of the pandemic and all the other chaos we've had this year. Early on in the pandemic, we went to a skeleton staff in our headquarters consisting of management, our marketing desk, and a few of our operations folks with everyone else working from home. We made adjustments to be able to open back up and protect our employees, including things like social distancing guidelines in common areas and installing plexiglass around the building. Biggest change we made was requiring face coverings at all times. We also had a steady stream of employee communications, including several that emphasized that none of these measures work unless each of us also take personal responsibility and the decisions we make when we are away from work. And I have to say our employees responded. Since the second half of June, I think that's right, Randy, we've been pretty much fully staffed in our offices and our case count has been minimal. Thanks to the safety measures put in place, and our people accepting personal responsibility. We don't believe that our performance would come close to matching today's announcement without the kind of collaboration that comes from actually being together, especially during times of chaos, which create their own opportunities. I am hard pressed to find a law firm back in the office. In the downtown company, someone recently told me, we were somewhat of an anomaly. I think that's anonymous with competitive advantage. Then came the storm. Luckily for most of you, the 2020 active hurricane system was nightly news. But for us, there were five major storms on the Gulf Coast. Three were hurricanes, one at category four, and now we've got another one on the way. All of these impacted our people, our operations and the operations of many of our customers. Loss of power in 2020 was a major event for people in businesses, especially refiners and petrochemicals along the upper Gulf Coast. So why aren't we talking about special charges or big earnings, it's related to what has been a historical Gulf hurricane season, again is because of our people. Some power outages in Louisiana lasted well over a month and we are appreciative to our engineering and operations personnel who planned for and quickly responded to these events. Time and, again, we have people who regardless of being impacted in their personal lives are still going to the extra mile to keep the assets they look after up and running. I'll spend a few minutes discussing our views of the global energy environment. Near-term, the global economy is reopening from a self-imposed sudden stop due to COVID-19. The pace of the recovery varies. But with the exception of air travel, much of Asia is returned to near normal, while U.S. and European energy demand still lags a little. Air traffic, particularly international travel continues to lag worldwide and several industries, refineries, airlines, hotels, restaurants need for business to get back to normal in order to really get the economies moving again. Apparently the development of vaccine is progressing rapidly. Meanwhile, treatment for the virus continues to take a giant leap. Even though the pace of the pandemic and the recovery is somewhat uncertain, the economic recovery thus far has led to a remarkable rebound and the demand for energy and energy products from the lows of the second quarter. We think it's pretty clear we are not going to shut the world down again and that not one, but several vaccines will soon be available. We've also been very outspoken that we believe a price signal for crude oil is coming. Given the combination of recovering demand worldwide and the base of record retrenchment and drilling and completion activities by U.S. producers with steep decline curves and the lack of oil and gas investment worldwide, we believe a price signal for higher crude oil prices could occur as early as the second half of next year. While the forward curves remain muted, we are really not alone in looking for a rebound. Finally, I'd like to cover our initiatives and sustainability and lower carbon energy. Jackie Richert and Libby Strait with the help from a lot of Enterprise for folks are responsible for our sustainability report that we published in July. And I think that we put on our website today, Jackie. Also, we recently \u2013 we put on our website today and investor deck dedicated our thoughts and actions on this topic. It's probably worth your time to take a look at it. I struggled with the term that I hear a lot energy transition. In my mind, energy evolution is more appropriate and that we are gradually moving to a world where renewables will compliment, but not replace oil and gas. We also understand that access to affordable reliable energy available at scale right now is what is going to continue to advance a higher quality of life worldwide. And energy evolution is underway and light hydrocarbons from the U.S. are already playing a key role in this evolution. World is still adding a billion people every 12 years and soon top of the population today of close to 8 billion and populations in developing countries wanting access to more convenient sources of energy. We believe demand for reliable U.S. energy, petrochemicals and related products will continue to grow. Without the U.S. shale light oil, NGLs, natural gas and our energy markets, the world is left relying on countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia, and they would again control the price of oil leading to a lesser quality of life for people at underdeveloped countries. It's clear from what's been going on at our docks that even in the middle of a pandemic, the world wants U.S. oil and gas. In addition to being what we believe is one of the global leaders in providing the world with new lighter liquid hydrocarbons, our businesses are making the substantial environmental contribution. For us, these aren't calculations in a model that make hypothetical future projections, and I think this comes out of the slide deck, some of these points, Jackie. We believe U.S. LPG exports could eliminate up to 20 million metric tons of CO2 emissions when compared to using coal, wood and animal waste for heating and cooking. We've made strong commitment to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of our operations with a 19% improvement and CO2 emissions per barrel of oil equivalent since 2011. We have over 16,000 micro solar installations along our pipelines, and approximately 17% of our purchase power comes from renewables. Last but not least, we are easily the largest midstream player in generating, consuming and marketing hydrogen from processes in our petrochemical plants, specifically iBDH and PDH. We estimate that with the completion of our second PDH facility in 2023, we will produce about 150 million cubic feet hydrogen, something over a 100 million of pure hydrogen. We use all of the hydrogen we can in our plants, and we sell the rest into the industrial gas market. We are really proud of this quarter. Last quarter, one of the sell-side analysts wrote, an Enterprise had a great quarter and no one cared. Well, we know our investors care. And even if the market doesn't care, I can assure you at Enterprise, we care. The Enterprise culture, we live by a motto that Dan's grandmother taught him. It's a simple motto, but it's what drives us. Do the best you can every day and that's what we are doing. And with that, I'll turn it over to Randy. Good morning, Jeremy. You gave me maybe good part. Yes. We look at a lot of opportunities that come in \u2013 they come through the front door down the air every week. We haven't seen any. That makes sense for us. And we did not look at the assets that Dow sells. What do you think, Randy and Justin or Brent, you want to take the lead on that? You want to take a shot, Brent? Brent, are you fully contracted on your pipeline capacity, if not... This is Jim. I think consolidation in the upstream is probably over the long-haul. Very good for the industry and frankly good for Enterprise. We like dealing with major players and this just gives \u2013 I think this fits our wheelhouse. I think it's necessary. And I think it's not over. I think there could be some headwinds for those who are not fully contracted. Why don't you take a shot first? Yes. Like I said earlier, Yves, I don't see anything that makes a hell of a lot of sense right now. I do think if you look at where we have trended in terms of the CapEx that we do spend. To Randy's point, we've really been disciplined that it's got to fit a value chain. So it's not \u2013 you're not going to see us just go out and build something. It's got to add to what we already have. And if you look at our CapEx for next year, I think Randy over 50% is in the petrochemical sector. So I mean, you get a pretty good idea of what we're doing. I think, we have a deal in principle that sells out, I think, PDH 2, Chris. Is that right? No pressure, buddy. The other thing I think we are so well positioned from an export perspective. It's not funny. Our LPG exports have not come up at all in the middle of this pandemic. So I think it is \u2013 we see how we are going to do projects, it's got to fit what we already have, and it's been like that since 1998. This is Jim here. When we look at \u2013 we've got a pretty big footprint aids. So when we look at whole company M&A, in many respects, what we would want to buy, we'd have to sell them everything we bought because the FTC wouldn't allow it. So we're going to be limited, I think. Randy, you kick-in. We're going to be limited and our ability to consolidate, given the footprint we have and antitrust issues that we would end up having. And trust me, we've looked at a lot of companies and there are companies out there that I personally would love to have, but there's no way we can do it because we'd sell everything we bought. Is that fair, Randy? I bet you already know. This is Jim. Thinking the neighborhood, and Brent, at five years. But we've done some work and restructuring some of those deals to extend the time and make those producers more competitive. So I mean, in every case, you talked about M-to-E 4, there's not a system that we have that we're not trying to shore up for the long-term. You start and I'll finish. Yes. To put it simply, price creates demand. We think price will create demand as we come out of this pandemic and price creates supply. So what we said in our script, we see \u2013 for all of the reasons that Randy said, we see a price signal coming. That doesn't mean the volume follows it immediately, but it ultimately would. I think the question is what price level do producers need? I think they're going to be \u2013 I think this consolidation we're seeing is also going to lead to more discipline and the more disciplined that these producers are, I think the more constructive price will be. If you're asking me for a number, you know you're not going to get it. I think if we looked at it, yes, we see an immediate opportunity, no. And I think first and foremost any of these things \u2013 first, they got to be economic. And I think this one is going to take a while to develop and we'll see where it goes. I think they're not nearly as strong as we thought they would be primarily because people are retrenching. But the other side of it is, some of these projects that we were looking at, we've been able to do contracts that I think give us a better return than doing a joint venture. So right now, I think we have discussions with one company going on. I'm not sure where it's going to go. They're retrenching. Okay. Branna before you give our replay information to our listeners, we'd like to thank everyone for joining our call today, and we're going to sign off as a company right now, but Branna, if you would give them the replay information. Thank you."

            "content": "This is Brent. There's probably going to be questions about the supply and what happens in 2021. And there's probably some downsides to that, but one of the positives is certainly ethane for 2021. Yes, this is Brent. So I think a lot of those conversations are probably happening more often than they have in the past in terms of what's the right thing for the industry. I feel like as Enterprise, we're in a good position just in terms of how we've contracted and the length of those contracts. There was probably concessions on both sides for the M2E4 piece, but I think that was a win-win solution for both parties involved there. But it's hard to argue that there's not excess capacity come on the Permian for crude oil. So the take-or-pay contracts are the ones that are going to move. When it starts going above those types of volumes, it's tough to move a whole lot of spot volumes unless you're extremely, extremely competitive versus other markets. So I think everybody is trying to be creative and I can tell you as an Enterprise, we probably spend more time trying to figure out how to optimize and be strategic than we have in the past. As much as I thought, we're trying to do that. I just think as an industry, there's an issue and there's contracts out there and other folks are moving just kind of spot volumes, and that's a tough business right now. Yes. I mean, if you look at, in terms of what we look at as fully contracted, there's always excess capacity, that's pretty expensive capacity. And every pipeline has as a curve where the costs start going up. But in terms of what we have that we can efficiently move or fully contracted, and our contracts don't start rolling off until 2027. So I kind of like our position in terms of where the pipeline goes. The market has access to, the docks has access to, all that helps differentiate midstream crude service providers. I don't think we ever tell people no, we'll figure out a way to do something. This contract will roll off. And there's some that rolled off this year. There's some that roll off next year. And then I'd say the bigger contracts roll off in 2022."

So it's been highly volatile, but let's call it, 500 to 1 million barrels just depend on when you look at it. And on the day, I'm sorry, but I can't respond to your number. Again, it just depends on what's happening with gas prices in any area of the country. Relative to trends, maybe Randy or Justin would want to talk about how you see ethane market balancers."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Randy Burkhalter. Please go ahead.\nRandy Burkhalter: Good morning and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss second quarter earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise\u2019s General Partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance and will assist on the call today. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, based on the beliefs of the Company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise\u2019s management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward-looking statements that may be made during this call. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\nJames Teague: Thank you Randy. I said at the beginning of the last call, when we were talking about first quarter earnings, while it was supposed to be an earnings call, I thought it was going to be a COVID call, and that is what it turned out to be. So sticking with that theme, I guess today, we are going to tell you our COVID story. For the second quarter of 2020, we reported EBITDA of $2 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the same quarter last year. Our DCF I think you saw the press release was 1.6 times coverage and year-to-date we have retained $1.2 billion and something else we are quite proud of is, this is the best first half safety performance that we have ever had at Enterprise. Given what we have all gone through, as you would expect, our volumes were down as a result of the pandemic and the oil price crash, but they are quickly improving. With all of the events, our results for the second quarter highlighted diversification of our system, the quality of our customers, cost control and the responsiveness of our assets and our employees during what was probably the most challenging quarter of my career. Our profits were protected by a strong base of firm customer obligations and the natural edge we have and our storage and marketing activities, which enabled us to largely offset the weakness in our natural gas gathering and processing and petrochemical businesses. The facts are, we are in the commodity service business. For us, both on the supply and demand side of the equation. We transport, store, upgrade and buy and sell multiple energy commodities. Because we are so tightly integrated, we have a lot of tools at our disposal. When the market says store crude we can. When the market says store diesel, but give me LPG, we convert wells and do so. When the markets say store Y-grade, we store Y-grade. In addition, our people and our systems have a strong history of performing, no matter the type of crisis and our balance sheet always has the dry powder to move quickly. We usually get the question of how much of our results are non-recurring, and it is the same question we got when Katrina blew through South Louisiana and literally knocked out every plant we had. Norco was down for months as was Promix, Venice and Neptune. Demand came back before indigenous supply and we made more money with our West to East pipelines than if those plants had been running. So it was non-recurring. We got that question during Hurricane Ike in 2008, which went right over Mont Belvieu. We had Mont Belvieu back up before producers could even get their supplies back. Got the question in Hurricane Harvey in 2017, when production never stopped, but virtually all of our customers quit taking, in some cases, for months, and we never interrupted a single contract customer. Events like what we are going through now, and the opportunities they present may be labeled as non-recurring, but our performance and our results are recurring regardless of the environment. We have outlined in today\u2019s earnings release that the petrochemical and refined product service segment was particularly hit hard due to the decrease in demand for those products. However, we remain encouraged by the efforts of most countries to reopen their economies. In addition to being one of the largest refined products consumers in the world, the U.S. is also a substantial exporter of refined products, especially the Latin America. As you all know, during the second quarter refining utilization rates bottomed in April, which negatively impacted our propylene and octane enhancement businesses due to lower feedstock availability and a decrease in international demand. Currently the refining industry has recovered to near 80% which has facilitated an improvement in both propylene and octane enhancements. On the production side, our natural gas gathering and processing were impacted by low prices and some shut in production. While those shut ins were not insignificant, for the most part they were relatively short lived and volumes on our system are recovering. We have made substantial progress in deferring and reducing capital by a billion dollars and we continue to discuss JV opportunities, which could further reduce our capital. In addition, Graham and his folks have reduced 2020 sustaining CapEx by $100 million. That said, we have some important projects coming online over the next few months. In the third quarter, our 11th fractionator and the ECHO segment of Wink to Webster expected online. And in the fourth quarter, we expect to complete our rich gas pipeline to Carthage, add a DIB at Mont Bellevue and complete a strategic ethylene tank and pipeline build out. We continue to make strides in our petrochemical segments, which we have always described as an extension of our NGL franchise and our value chain, because we are probably the only midstream that is fairly big in the petrochemical midstream space. It is easy to underestimate the long-term strategic importance of what we are doing. Rather than being a feedstock starved olefin industry with a handful of players, the United States, especially in ethylene, has quickly moved into being the world\u2019s incremental supplier. This is really no different than what has happened in LPG over the last 10-years where the U.S. has moved from being an importer to supplying over 75% of the world\u2019s demand growth. In short, to meet the world\u2019s growing demand for primary petrochemical products, Enterprise built the world\u2019s first open access hub for polymer grade propylene. Now we have developed the first hub for ethylene. These hubs are transforming how ethylene and propylene markets transact and will create a true marketplace for the world\u2019s primary petrochemical producers, consumers, and traders. These hubs provide the essentials for an efficient market, reliable supplies, price transparency, and access to domestic and global markets. In June, we loaded a record size ethylene cargo of 44 million pounds. Then in July, we successfully loaded combination cargoes of NGLs and olefins on the same vessel, including the simultaneous loading of propane and polymer grade propylene into separate compartments on a VLGC at our Houston Ship Channel facility, as well as the simultaneous loading of ethane and ethylene on a vessel at our Morgan\u2019s Port facility. Both vessels where the first export cargoes of their kind from the U.S. Co-loading olefins on larger vessels with NGLs allows for more efficient use of dock capacity, but it also provides significant freight benefits to petrochemical export customers. I thought I would also spend a minute to talk about what we are doing to keep our business running, while keeping our people safe. We started out the quarter with much of our headquarters staff working from home, but over the last few weeks, we have been gradually bringing our headquarters personnel back into the office and are essentially staffed at this point, fully staffed. In addition to helping our employees understand social distancing, we also now require face coverings at all times in our office. It is an adjustment, but we have adjusted and thanks to our people taking personal responsibility, both in and out of the office, our case count has been minimal. I sincerely want to thank our people for their flexibility, their adjustments and their sacrifices. And I would also like to give a shout out to our operations and commercial folks that were not able to work-from-home. Plants and pipelines don\u2019t run themselves. There is no such thing as a home based control center, and the collaboration between our commercial people that we asked to be here, ask might be too soft - that we told to be here went a long way to achieving those results. I guess, finally, I would just like to say that, I think we have got the best employees in the business, and I think their performance this quarter reflects that. And I just want them to know how much they are appreciate it. Randy.\nRandall Fowler: Thanks, Jim. Good morning. I will start with the income statement for the second quarter. Net income attributable to limited partners for the second quarter of 2020 was $1 billion or $0.47 per unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $0.55 per unit for the second quarter of 2019. Net income for the second quarter of 2020 included $51 million or $0.02 per unit of expense related to an increase in the deferred tax liability associated with the OTA Holdings Corporation we acquired from Marquard & Bahls in March, 2020 and the settlement of a liquidity option agreement related to our acquisition of Oiltanking back in 2014. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2020, compared to $2 billion for the second quarter of 2019. Changes in operating accounts or think of it as working capital, accounted for approximately $660 million or 80% of the $842 million decrease in cash flow from operations between the two periods. We used working capital to fund our marketing and contango activities, during the quarter. We currently expect this usage to peak during the third quarter of 2020. Excluding changes in working capital accounts, cash flow from operations for the second quarter of 2020 was about 10% lower than the second quarter of last year. The change in distributable cash flow between the two periods, mirrors this with a decrease of approximately 8.4%. Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations, less cash used in investing activities, plus contributions from our joint venture partners was $305 million for the quarter, which again was reduced by our use of working capital. Free cash flow was $2.7 billion for the 12-months ended June, 2020, which was 27% higher than the comparable trailing 12-months ending in June of last year. We define payout ratio as the sum of cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from operations. Our payout ratio was 83% for the second quarter of 2020, which is an inflated percentage due to our use of cash flow from operations used for working capital purposes. For the trailing 12-months, it was 62%. We declared our distribution of $0.445 per unit with respect to the second quarter on July 7th and it will be paid August 12th. This distribution represents a 1.1% increase, when compared with the same quarter of 2019 and is flat to the prior two quarters. As we stated our first quarter call, given the uncertainty of the macroeconomic backdrop, our Board will continue to evaluate our distribution growth quarter-by-quarter in 2020. Additionally, EPDs distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 1.9 million EPD units in the open market during the second quarter, which rivals the purchase activity of our typical institutional investors. Moving on to capital expenditures. We have recently placed approximately $150 million of assets into service in the second quarter and have another $6.6 billion of projects under construction and underwritten long-term contracts. Our capital investments were $910 million during the second quarter, which include $74 million for sustaining capital expenditures. We still anticipate spending between $2.5 billion and $3 billion in growth capital projects for this year and approximately $300 million for sustaining capital expenditures. For 2021 and 2022, we currently anticipate growth capital investments to be approximately $2.3 billion and $1 billion respectively. This is an aggregate $700 million reduction from guidance we provided for 2021 and 2022, at the end of the first quarter. The changes were largely attributable to the indefinite deferral of several expansion projects of which some of the largest were at our Houston Ship Channel facility. We continue to engage with industry participants regarding potential joint ventures for sanctioned projects, but the pace of these discussions have slowed due to COVID-19. Our capital expenditure forecast excludes our proposed SPOT offshore crude oil terminal that is subject to government approvals. Currently, we do not expect to receive these approvals in 2020. Moving on to capitalization, our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $30 billion at June 30, 2020. Assuming the first call date for our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio was almost 16-years. Assuming the final maturity date for the hybrids, the average life was almost 20-years. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12-months ended June 30, 2020 was $8 billion and our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.4x after adjusting debt for the partial equity credit for the hybrid debt securities and also further reduced by unrestricted cash. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $7.3 billion at June 30 including availability under our existing credit facility and approximately 1.3 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. Finally, before we open it up for Q&A, I want to mention that we also announced this morning in a separate press release that our 2019-2020 sustainability report, which reflects our latest environmental, social and governance disclosures is currently available on our website. We have also initiated the annual review process with the independent sustainability writing providers and believe our disclosures and initiatives, which are described in this comprehensive 104 page report will be reflected in updated scores. We believe our stakeholders will find these efforts beneficial. We thank our customers, community leaders, banks, debt and equity investors, and board members for their participation in our sustainability survey that drove the outline for this report. With that Randy, I think we can open it up for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay, Sidney, we are ready to take questions from our listeners.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off with the question and maybe Tony could answer best just you guys had talked about pace of recovery being slower and maybe extending into 2021. I was wondering if you could provide a bit more details, I guess, in how you see that transpiring and how that impacts you across, I guess your different business lines.\nAnthony Chovanec: You want to talk about the production side or the demand side. Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: If you have both, we will take both. \nAnthony Chovanec: Yes. So, obviously we had this shut in because of the price crash and chaos, and we think about a million and a half, and I will just use crude as an example of 1.5 to 1.8 million barrels came off the market. I\u2019m kind of a numbers kind of person, not real visual, but if you look at how that production has come back, it is probably one of the steepest V\u2019s I\u2019ve ever seen in statistics. So yes, we have recovered a substantial amount of it. We think that maybe 300,000 barrels will lag. And but with that said, you can\u2019t deny given the amount of declines that the shales have that momentum has changed and there is a fair amount of ground to be picked up. So, that is the reality. When we look at Y-grade coming into our system. For example, those numbers are really strong and I will let Brent address that. But when we get out to 2025 as we see it today, we will be down from where we were before, and it is not because momentum doesn\u2019t pick back up. Look, we think that we were at about 1,150 completions a month in February, and we think that as we get into 2022, that we will be at around 950. Okay. And probably completing the best of the best wells that is what is in our forecast for today. And so, when you get out to 2025, there\u2019ll be some smaller volumes than what we said before. But, Brent do you want to talk about what is going on in our business in that regard and what you are saying?\nBrent Secrest: Yes. The one thing we have seen is just the resiliency of the Permian and part of it is just what is going on out there and part of it is how we have contracted. But, if you look at our Y-grade receipts for June, if you look at our Y-grade receipts for July, those are both records for Enterprise. And if you look at a Y-grade inventories they are at all time highs. So, in terms of how we have contracted and in terms of what we are seeing coming out of the Permian, the fractionation volumes that we have access to, those have bounced back quite nicely.\nAnthony Chovanec: On the demand side, gasoline is not really - I mean, it is off 10% to 15%, depending on what numbers you look at. Diesel is the same. And again, that is to be expected. So, if we think about going forward, what the data shows is Latin America and we are a large exporting country to Latin America, is waking back up. Moving away from being shut down and largely I think about Mexico and Brazil. So, that is a positive and we are hoping that as we work off inventories, we will put our refineries back to work.\nJeremy Tonet: That is very helpful. Thanks. And on the petchem side, as far as the demand there. Any trends that we should be think with LPGs and petchem?\nChristopher D\u2019Anna: Yes, Jeremy. This is Chris D\u2019Anna. We saw at the beginning of the pandemic, so in March, April timeframe, lower demands on the durables. The single use actually was pretty resilient. We saw pretty good demand. We are starting to see a gradual improvement in demand for the durables. And of course single use is still pretty good.\nJames Teague: The fact that our ethylene export dock is sold out also sets up in the back the demand for ethylene.\nJeremy Tonet: That is very helpful. Thanks. And one last one, if I could. Just with regards to arbitrage opportunities that you have seen so far, kind of the nonrecurring recurring earnings that you have gotten and that really boosted this quarter. What type of opportunities do you see in the third quarter here, I guess with contango, what have you delayed realization of those profits. Just trying to think through that a bit more.\nJames Teague: I think, Jeremy, what we said last call is we thought we\u2019d be at $500 million, $600 million in spread and I think we are probably saying for the year, we will be at the upper end of that range.\nJeremy Tonet: Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Good morning. The main fundamental bear case on Enterprise is expected margin compression in the NGL business. Now that everything looks overbuilt for the medium-term. Anything that you can provide to address these areas of current price war basically, and NGL pipelines and frac and exports will be really helpful.\nAnthony Chovanec: Yes. Jean Ann. Your question is, as we think about margin compression and I\u2019m going to assume you are talking about as people re-contract on midstream assets. Is that where you are headed?\nJean Ann Salisbury: I think it is a little bit more than that. I think people usually talk about fracs, but I think it is really the whole chain of NGL pipelines, frac and exports. It seems like now there is too much capacity. And so people are concerned that you could see a similar phenomenon to what we see in crude, which is - when contracts come up that you would see massive declines.\nJames Teague: I think what you are saying kind of make sense, I think you have to take a look at what a company has to work with. I emphasized petrochemicals in my opening comments because that gives us a heck of a lot more longer of the value chain to leverage, so it is about what are you having to leverage? And while one part of that value chain may be under some stress, the total won\u2019t be. Is that fair Brent?\nBrent Secrest: Yes. \nA \u2013 James Teague: And you had another point to make. So, in our situation, yes, maybe, but we\u2019ve got a value chain that we are going to leverage and we\u2019ll give them what they want, where the hot button is. We\u2019ll collect what we need at the rest of the value chain.\nBrent Secrest: I think there is some offset Jean Ann, and what we are seeing on ethane, is an offset on volumes, both for pipelines and for fractionation. I hear what you are saying from an industry standpoint and I will repeat myself. I think we have done a heck of a job contracting. I think how you contract and who you contract with matters in this environment. And we will say that about other commodities as well. If you look at our LPG export facility, it is in a very, very good position in terms of the contracts we have in place. And if you look at the balance of this year and you look at the following couple of years, we are in a very, very good spot. Then ultimately if supply starts going down, you look at what we have built in Mont Belvieu and the pricing points that we have. You know, I fundamentally believe that the downstream assets that we have at those pricing points benefit. So there are some offsets in this environment.\nJean Ann Salisbury: That makes sense. So effectively the bundled chain you think will kind of give you a better and different outcome than the worry on crude pipelines more broadly.\nJames Teague: I think it always has.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. Thanks that is all for me.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with SunTrust. Your line is open.\nTristan Richardson: Hey, good morning guys. Could you talk about your prepared comments about the JV opportunities for reducing capital? You noted that that process has been elongated due to the pandemic. Are the six potential JVs still in play that you noted on the last call or can you just give us a general update there.\nJames Teague: Yes, I think on the last call, we said that we were pretty engaged with three of those six. And not to guess, but what I could say today is we are probably pretty engaged with one of those three. It is not that you are not in discussions with the others, but it is like Randy said in this environment, everybody\u2019s just kind of pulling their horns in. So we are discussing some JVs with some of our larger projects. But I wouldn\u2019t say we are highly engaged with more than one. But we are highly engaged with one.\nTristan Richardson: That is helpful and then just a quick follow-up. Could you just help frame how we should think about maybe the largest components of the 2021 $2 billion outlook? Whether it be, PDH-2 or Midland-to-ECHO 4 and does this number presume joint ventures or is this more like an 8x type of budget?\nRandall Fowler: Yes Tristan this is Randy. The $2.3 billion is assuming no joint ventures. And if you would, two-thirds of that $2.3 billion are really three projects, and that is PDH 2, Midland-to-ECHO 4 crude oil pipeline and the Gillis natural gas pipeline.\nTristan Richardson: Great. Thank you guys very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering. Your line is open.\nColton Bean: So you noted in the press release the process volumes were back to 88% of March levels and NGLs were nearly at parity. On the inlet volume side, can you provide a bit more detail as to the mix across your footprint? And then on NGLs, is that outperformance relative to gas? Is that primarily increased extraction?\nJames Teague: Who wants to take that?\nBrent Secrest: This is Brent, Colton but, I think I would just say ethane has probably increased about 4%, maybe 5% across our system. And then in terms of just the whole volume metric and I\u2019m not sure I understood the question. But where you are seeing the growth come from is obviously in Permian and I think you\u2019ll see in July some very robust volumes that come from that area.\nColton Bean: And that was mainly the focus of the first point. It was just when you look at kind of the four primary footprints for you guys, what would that recovery look like on a by basin basis?\nBrent Secrest: We are not seeing a whole lot. I mean, Eagle Ford has been fairly flat. There\u2019s people talking about putting up rigs. There\u2019s a certain company, that is looking to deploy some capital there that we are involved with. But I would say in the Rockies, you are seeing ethane recoveries pick up out there. And then obviously in the Permian just in terms of how aggressive we have been on contracting and just the bounce back in volumes, we are seeing the bulk of the benefits out there in that area.\nJames Teague: But to cut to the chase, it is Permian centric, right?\nBrent Secrest: Yes, sir.\nColton Bean: Understood. And then just on the updates to the 2022 capital budget, now down to $1 billion. Can you frame what that might look like if you were to strip out the PDH 2 spend or in simpler terms, if you remove the major projects, what that run rate might be?\nRandall Fowler: It would be less. Yes. I mean, you are probably knocking on the door of $500 million.\nColton Bean: Got it. Alright. That is helpful. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ujjwal Pradhan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions here. Firstly, a quick follow up on Tristan\u2019s question on the potential JVs on growth capital projects. Could you maybe high level discuss, what are the parameters of your negotiations there and who would be your preferred JV partners? \nJames Teague: Typically they bring more than money. They have got to bring throughput or they got to bring offtake. Typically those are the kind of people we do joint ventures with. Does that answer your question?\nUjjwal Pradhan: I guess that does. That is helpful. And in terms of sort of the parameters of what you are negotiating or within the project, how you plan to sort of sell the interest. Can you comment on that?\nRandall Fowler: Could you repeat that question? I\u2019m sorry.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Sorry. Could you maybe discuss, what you are considering when it comes to the negotiations? Maybe simply put, some of the bigger projects that you have on the backlog, which ones, how would you rank them in terms of which ones you would want the partners to get involved in?\nJames Teague: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what we wouldn\u2019t want them getting involved in, that is the church house, which I think is probably our storage system in Mont Bellevue. I don\u2019t think we have a problem with having them involved in some of our - some of the less strategic things that maybe feed the system but that is about it, that\u2019s about all we are going to say.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it. Thanks for that. And a follow-up on elections this year. Would you be able to share some thoughts on how you are watching the elections and the recent movements there, and maybe if you could share your perspective on potential impacts and/or benefits to EPD, as well as the overall MLP space in terms of corporate taxes, as well as energy infrastructure proposals.\nRandall Fowler: Okay. This is Randy, I guess it is the season political rhetoric, and I don\u2019t know how much you can really - with some of the proposals that are being put out in the public domain. Frankly, I don\u2019t know how focused you can get all of those at this point in time, and again, because everyone is in campaign mode. I think with the deficits that the country is running up, it looks like, income taxes, tax rates for both individuals and corporations are going to go up and perhaps substantially. So to be honest, this year, we\u2019ve really not spent any time coming in and looking at an MLP versus C-corp analysis. We have been too focused on executing, and just given where the uncertainty in the environment and the volatility in the environment, frankly, we are pretty content with our current MLP structure. And as far as policy is going, as far as what has been proposed, I go back a little bit and use the analogy of the U.S. Highway Trust Fund. You know, it was created in 1956 and its taxes on motor gasoline and diesel to come in and fund road construction and road maintenance. The last time the tax on diesel and gasoline was raised to fund that Trust Fund was 1993. Since 2008, the Trust Fund has been running deficits and no one in Congress, be it a Republican or Democrat administration has been willing to go up and raise the tax on motor gasoline and diesel because they didn\u2019t want the impact on individuals and they did not want impact on businesses. And some of the things that are being contemplated in some of these policies that we hear in this campaign would substantially increase the cost for the energy of both on individuals and companies. So, it is really hard to see if the powers that be wouldn\u2019t even increase the price on gasoline, how some of these large proposals can come in and be executed.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Got it. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi good morning, everyone. Good to hear everyone as well. Maybe to start off, Jim in your prepared remarks, you sort of talked about how the marketing and spread businesses is effectively a natural hedge for the business, opportunities pop up with dislocations and so forth. I was just wondering if you can sort of give us your thoughts on how the trends play out for the balance of this year? And what I mean by that is, spread opportunities start to recede over the next couple of quarters, but at the same time, you have the shut-ins coming back, base business starts to move higher. Is the trend of the base business recovering stronger than the, I guess, subsiding of the marketing opportunities? Is there a scenario where Q3 can be higher than Q2 without getting like specific guidance? Just sort of talking about the trends, which is the stronger trend right now, or is the natural hedge going to reverse itself and sort of keep us in a running flat scenario?\nJames Teague: Yes. It is a good question Shneur. I think personally, you get dislocations and you get spreads when you have events. So when crude prices fall invariably, we will see contango \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s been the way it has been. If those spreads are there then in my mind, our pipelines are probably a lot more throughput than we have today. So that is kind of way I see it. I\u2019m probably a little more bullish than Tony is in terms of recovery. I think, I personally think demand is going to recover sooner than, probably Tony thinks it is going to recover. And I think you are going to get a price signal next year on hydrocarbons that turn some things back on. So, that is what I see.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay. And maybe a follow-up question here. Just sticking with the theme of dislocations. Obviously, you have been very opportunistic to take advantage of the market on dislocations to capture spreads within hydrocarbons for your base business itself. When I think about EPD\u2019s unit price, do you see similar dislocations in your stock price right now? For example, you are down today with the results that you have put out. And do you see an opportunity to use the excess cash generated from the strong marketing proceeds, lower CapEx budget to potentially accelerate or increase your buyback target to take advantage of these dislocations within your stock price?\nJames Teague: I\u2019m going to let Randy answer that but individually there\u2019s a number of us that have accelerated our buyback program.\nRandall Fowler: Shneur I think that just as I mentioned, that really this year we are really coming in and going quarter-by-quarter, as we consider cash distribution growth to our investors and spending capital on buybacks falls in that same category. So again, we will come in and take a look at it quarter-by-quarter. We had come in and allocated approximately 2% of cash flow from operations to go towards buybacks. We have done that. We will come in and look for opportunities for the remainder of the year to see how we would want to come in. And if we are going to return more capital to investors, whether that would be in the form of distributions or buybacks, so more to come on that.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay. And so it is fair to conclude that the 2% target is not a hard line. It is something that you can go above and that you would look at a 9.75% yield as probably being very opportunistic?\nRandall Fowler: You know Shenur, yes it was approximately 2% is what we said, but we will come in and take a look at it quarter-by-quarter. Some of this we would like to get as Tony described. There is still some uncertainty out there as far as coming in and how the economy reopens, we just like to get a little bit more visibility on what we see for the business environment.\nShneur Gershuni: Alright. That sounds great. I appreciate time, I want to keep it to just two questions. Have great and safe day.\nJames Teague: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Justin Jenkins with Raymond James. Your line is open. \nJustin Jenkins: Hi morning, everyone. I guess I would like to start on 2020 growth spending. Randy, I think you covered a bit of the further outlook for \u201921, \u201822, but is it more timing at this point in terms of the range of spend less for 2020 or is some of that dependent on JV outcomes? \nRandall Fowler: It is the range that we give for 2020, the $2.5 billion to $3 billion is largely just timing on how we see cash leave, go out the door.\nJustin Jenkins: Okay. That makes sense. And then you also mentioned that you expect working capital to peak in 3Q in terms of usage. Do you have a magnitude in mind for that? And then maybe give us a sense of how quick that cash comes back in the door as a tailwind thereafter?\nRandall Fowler: Yes. Probably you could see call it another $300 million to $500 million increase in working capital between now and the end of the third quarter. And then I think it would just, work off over - from the third quarter, probably work off - typically you have got a good bit of working capital deployed. I mean, just in our typical business, you have a good bit of working capital deployed over the fourth quarter. So I think you would see ultimately from that peak in the third quarter, you probably see it worked off largely by the end of the first quarter of next year.\nJustin Jenkins: Got it. Thanks Randy.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. Just following up on the last question, if your working capital is still increasing in Q3, should we assume that means some of the contango marketing type opportunities could be even greater in the future than what we saw in Q2 in future quarters?\nRandall Fowler: No. I think some of it is just a carry over to what we put on. I think what Jim alluded to that we think we may be as far as total spread opportunities be in the upper end of that $600 million range, really sort of see that split 50/50 first half of the year, second half of the year. But, you still have, just with some of the positions that we put on, you can have working capital creep with those positions.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. That is helpful. And then going back to last quarter, I thought the messaging was pretty strong from the company that there weren\u2019t acquisitions you were interested in. I guess, with the dust settling somewhat here. What is your view on the merits of acquiring companies or assets and synergies? I mean, the one thing that is striking is, you guys could issue 10-year debt right now at under 2% interest rate, so just any updated thoughts on how you are thinking about that?\nJames Teague: I would say, we\u2019ve got the same answer as the first quarter.\nRandall Fowler: Keith I think you heard that one, that is where I think we are too. We look at opportunities that come across. Frankly, we have not seen as far as teasers coming in. We frankly have not seen much in the way of teasers come across the last three or four months, and certainly not anything compelling. So, I think right now we are just focused on continuing to execute with the business that we have and go from there. But I mean, we are open to come in and look at opportunities. But it really needs to be a good fit, probably what would be more likely would come in and be a bolt-on type opportunity. But again, really haven\u2019t seen anything develop on that front.\nKeith Stanley: Interesting. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons Energy. Your line is open.\nPearce Hammond: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Just two questions on the same subject. The first one is what are your views on U.S. NGL export capacity? Do you see more opportunities to grow your NGL export business? And then the second question is, overall, it seems that U.S. NGL exports have a better outlook than U.S. crude exports. Do you think that is a fair statement?\nJames Teague: This is Jim. But Tony and Brent chime in, I think the world needs U.S. LPG and as lifestyles improve in other parts of the world, in many cases LPG is what creates that improvement. Do you have anything to add?\nAnthony Chovanec: Data speaks for itself Jim. You are exactly right. You look at what happened in the height of the pandemic, Brent were you blown away by the demand?\nBrent Secrest: Absolutely. Record type numbers.\nJames Teague: You know I wouldn\u2019t be too quick to write off crude oil exports. We have seen quite a lot. We have seen a pick up in crude exports. I thought we had a record week as a country at one point.\nBrent Secrest: A couple of weeks ago I think we started going back to the highs. We\u2019re seeing just a different interest in the slate, the lighter. There is a bigger demand for West Texas light. There is a bigger demand for the Eagle Ford type barrel as people have the bid on motor gasoline and we are seeing those go to Asia, mostly Korea and some Latin America. But on the LPG side, I think we are in a good spot as Enterprise. You know, we have a project out there that we can expand when the time is right to expand. I\u2019m not sure from a capacity standpoint, it needs to be expanded anytime soon, but certainly we have a project that is a low capital project that we can execute on.\nPearce Hammond: Thank you for your responses.\nRandy Burkhalter: This is Randy. We have time for one more question. And then if you would give the replay information.\nOperator: Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Just two quick ones for me, so just to stay on the LPG export topic, it seems like your volumes are holding up here at least in the beginning of the first half of - the second half of 2020. Can you just give your, kind of, talk about what you are seeing? Are you seeing any drop off as some of these countries come out of lockdown or are you still seeing strength there in LPG export volumes? And if so, what do you think is driving it?\nJames Teague: Hi Michael, I think we still see strength. I think what is driving it is what we talked about a while ago.\nBrent Secrest: I think we are seeing a lot of PDH demand over in Asia. I think just in terms of how we contracted Michael, I say this humbly, but I think we will probably be toward the end to see any kind of drop off. I mean, we have just in terms of our supply position, in terms of the pricing point in terms of how aggressive that we have contracted out for this year and the next couple of years. We are in a good position to kind of maintain these type of levels. I think you are seeing us export, call it around 18 million barrels a month of LPGs. And I would say that\u2019s sticky. Those are sticky numbers.\nJames Teague: What is interesting Michael is whenever we do get a cancellation, we have been pretty successful in back filling it with the supply. So the appetite is there.\nMichael Blum: Okay, great. That makes a lot of sense. My second I think is probably for Randy, you referenced the target payout ratio number that you are now referring to a bit. Do you have kind of like a long-term target for where you want that to sort of settle out overtime? Or are you thinking about it that way?\nRandall Fowler: Michael, I don\u2019t think we have developed our thoughts that far along on setting a long-term target. Some of your balance to that would be what kind of growth opportunities do you see? So, we have really not come in and settled on any long-term targets. I mean, we do come in and compare how we are doing compared to the market and I think when we are coming in and look at the market and across the various sectors of the S&P 500 on the page, I think we are amongst the top two, top three of the sector. And it is by nature being an MLP, the whole thing with an MLP is you have a high payout ratio and so I think we comp pretty well against the market.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thanks everyone. I appreciate it.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay, Sidney. Do you want to give the replay information?\nOperator: Certainly. You may dial in at 1800-859-2056 or 404-537-3406, with the access code 1667154 to access the replay information. I would now like to turn the call back to Randy Burkhalter for any further remarks.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay. That concludes our remarks today and I would like to thank everyone for joining us and have a good day. Thank you and good-bye now.\nOperator: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Randall Fowler",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good morning. I will start with the income statement for the second quarter. Net income attributable to limited partners for the second quarter of 2020 was $1 billion or $0.47 per unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $0.55 per unit for the second quarter of 2019. Net income for the second quarter of 2020 included $51 million or $0.02 per unit of expense related to an increase in the deferred tax liability associated with the OTA Holdings Corporation we acquired from Marquard & Bahls in March, 2020 and the settlement of a liquidity option agreement related to our acquisition of Oiltanking back in 2014. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2020, compared to $2 billion for the second quarter of 2019. Changes in operating accounts or think of it as working capital, accounted for approximately $660 million or 80% of the $842 million decrease in cash flow from operations between the two periods. We used working capital to fund our marketing and contango activities, during the quarter. We currently expect this usage to peak during the third quarter of 2020. Excluding changes in working capital accounts, cash flow from operations for the second quarter of 2020 was about 10% lower than the second quarter of last year. The change in distributable cash flow between the two periods, mirrors this with a decrease of approximately 8.4%. Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations, less cash used in investing activities, plus contributions from our joint venture partners was $305 million for the quarter, which again was reduced by our use of working capital. Free cash flow was $2.7 billion for the 12-months ended June, 2020, which was 27% higher than the comparable trailing 12-months ending in June of last year. We define payout ratio as the sum of cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from operations. Our payout ratio was 83% for the second quarter of 2020, which is an inflated percentage due to our use of cash flow from operations used for working capital purposes. For the trailing 12-months, it was 62%. We declared our distribution of $0.445 per unit with respect to the second quarter on July 7th and it will be paid August 12th. This distribution represents a 1.1% increase, when compared with the same quarter of 2019 and is flat to the prior two quarters. As we stated our first quarter call, given the uncertainty of the macroeconomic backdrop, our Board will continue to evaluate our distribution growth quarter-by-quarter in 2020. Additionally, EPDs distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 1.9 million EPD units in the open market during the second quarter, which rivals the purchase activity of our typical institutional investors. Moving on to capital expenditures. We have recently placed approximately $150 million of assets into service in the second quarter and have another $6.6 billion of projects under construction and underwritten long-term contracts. Our capital investments were $910 million during the second quarter, which include $74 million for sustaining capital expenditures. We still anticipate spending between $2.5 billion and $3 billion in growth capital projects for this year and approximately $300 million for sustaining capital expenditures. For 2021 and 2022, we currently anticipate growth capital investments to be approximately $2.3 billion and $1 billion respectively. This is an aggregate $700 million reduction from guidance we provided for 2021 and 2022, at the end of the first quarter. The changes were largely attributable to the indefinite deferral of several expansion projects of which some of the largest were at our Houston Ship Channel facility. We continue to engage with industry participants regarding potential joint ventures for sanctioned projects, but the pace of these discussions have slowed due to COVID-19. Our capital expenditure forecast excludes our proposed SPOT offshore crude oil terminal that is subject to government approvals. Currently, we do not expect to receive these approvals in 2020. Moving on to capitalization, our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $30 billion at June 30, 2020. Assuming the first call date for our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio was almost 16-years. Assuming the final maturity date for the hybrids, the average life was almost 20-years. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12-months ended June 30, 2020 was $8 billion and our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.4x after adjusting debt for the partial equity credit for the hybrid debt securities and also further reduced by unrestricted cash. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $7.3 billion at June 30 including availability under our existing credit facility and approximately 1.3 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. Finally, before we open it up for Q&A, I want to mention that we also announced this morning in a separate press release that our 2019-2020 sustainability report, which reflects our latest environmental, social and governance disclosures is currently available on our website. We have also initiated the annual review process with the independent sustainability writing providers and believe our disclosures and initiatives, which are described in this comprehensive 104 page report will be reflected in updated scores. We believe our stakeholders will find these efforts beneficial. We thank our customers, community leaders, banks, debt and equity investors, and board members for their participation in our sustainability survey that drove the outline for this report. With that Randy, I think we can open it up for questions. Yes Tristan this is Randy. The $2.3 billion is assuming no joint ventures. And if you would, two-thirds of that $2.3 billion are really three projects, and that is PDH 2, Midland-to-ECHO 4 crude oil pipeline and the Gillis natural gas pipeline. It would be less. Yes. I mean, you are probably knocking on the door of $500 million. Could you repeat that question? I'm sorry. Okay. This is Randy, I guess it is the season political rhetoric, and I don't know how much you can really - with some of the proposals that are being put out in the public domain. Frankly, I don't know how focused you can get all of those at this point in time, and again, because everyone is in campaign mode. I think with the deficits that the country is running up, it looks like, income taxes, tax rates for both individuals and corporations are going to go up and perhaps substantially. So to be honest, this year, we've really not spent any time coming in and looking at an MLP versus C-corp analysis. We have been too focused on executing, and just given where the uncertainty in the environment and the volatility in the environment, frankly, we are pretty content with our current MLP structure. And as far as policy is going, as far as what has been proposed, I go back a little bit and use the analogy of the U.S. Highway Trust Fund. You know, it was created in 1956 and its taxes on motor gasoline and diesel to come in and fund road construction and road maintenance. The last time the tax on diesel and gasoline was raised to fund that Trust Fund was 1993. Since 2008, the Trust Fund has been running deficits and no one in Congress, be it a Republican or Democrat administration has been willing to go up and raise the tax on motor gasoline and diesel because they didn't want the impact on individuals and they did not want impact on businesses. And some of the things that are being contemplated in some of these policies that we hear in this campaign would substantially increase the cost for the energy of both on individuals and companies. So, it is really hard to see if the powers that be wouldn't even increase the price on gasoline, how some of these large proposals can come in and be executed. Shneur I think that just as I mentioned, that really this year we are really coming in and going quarter-by-quarter, as we consider cash distribution growth to our investors and spending capital on buybacks falls in that same category. So again, we will come in and take a look at it quarter-by-quarter. We had come in and allocated approximately 2% of cash flow from operations to go towards buybacks. We have done that. We will come in and look for opportunities for the remainder of the year to see how we would want to come in. And if we are going to return more capital to investors, whether that would be in the form of distributions or buybacks, so more to come on that. You know Shenur, yes it was approximately 2% is what we said, but we will come in and take a look at it quarter-by-quarter. Some of this we would like to get as Tony described. There is still some uncertainty out there as far as coming in and how the economy reopens, we just like to get a little bit more visibility on what we see for the business environment. It is the range that we give for 2020, the $2.5 billion to $3 billion is largely just timing on how we see cash leave, go out the door. Yes.

And then I think it would just, work off over - from the third quarter, probably work off - typically you have got a good bit of working capital deployed. I mean, just in our typical business, you have a good bit of working capital deployed over the fourth quarter. So I think you would see ultimately from that peak in the third quarter, you probably see it worked off largely by the end of the first quarter of next year. No. I think some of it is just a carry over to what we put on. I think what Jim alluded to that we think we may be as far as total spread opportunities be in the upper end of that $600 million range, really sort of see that split 50/50 first half of the year, second half of the year.

The single use actually was pretty resilient. We saw pretty good demand. We are starting to see a gradual improvement in demand for the durables. And of course single use is still pretty good."

            "content": "Thank you Randy. I said at the beginning of the last call, when we were talking about first quarter earnings, while it was supposed to be an earnings call, I thought it was going to be a COVID call, and that is what it turned out to be. So sticking with that theme, I guess today, we are going to tell you our COVID story. For the second quarter of 2020, we reported EBITDA of $2 billion compared to $2.1 billion for the same quarter last year. Our DCF I think you saw the press release was 1.6 times coverage and year-to-date we have retained $1.2 billion and something else we are quite proud of is, this is the best first half safety performance that we have ever had at Enterprise. Given what we have all gone through, as you would expect, our volumes were down as a result of the pandemic and the oil price crash, but they are quickly improving. With all of the events, our results for the second quarter highlighted diversification of our system, the quality of our customers, cost control and the responsiveness of our assets and our employees during what was probably the most challenging quarter of my career. Our profits were protected by a strong base of firm customer obligations and the natural edge we have and our storage and marketing activities, which enabled us to largely offset the weakness in our natural gas gathering and processing and petrochemical businesses. The facts are, we are in the commodity service business. For us, both on the supply and demand side of the equation. We transport, store, upgrade and buy and sell multiple energy commodities. Because we are so tightly integrated, we have a lot of tools at our disposal. When the market says store crude we can. When the market says store diesel, but give me LPG, we convert wells and do so. When the markets say store Y-grade, we store Y-grade. In addition, our people and our systems have a strong history of performing, no matter the type of crisis and our balance sheet always has the dry powder to move quickly. We usually get the question of how much of our results are non-recurring, and it is the same question we got when Katrina blew through South Louisiana and literally knocked out every plant we had. Norco was down for months as was Promix, Venice and Neptune. Demand came back before indigenous supply and we made more money with our West to East pipelines than if those plants had been running. So it was non-recurring. We got that question during Hurricane Ike in 2008, which went right over Mont Belvieu. We had Mont Belvieu back up before producers could even get their supplies back. Got the question in Hurricane Harvey in 2017, when production never stopped, but virtually all of our customers quit taking, in some cases, for months, and we never interrupted a single contract customer. Events like what we are going through now, and the opportunities they present may be labeled as non-recurring, but our performance and our results are recurring regardless of the environment. We have outlined in today's earnings release that the petrochemical and refined product service segment was particularly hit hard due to the decrease in demand for those products. However, we remain encouraged by the efforts of most countries to reopen their economies. In addition to being one of the largest refined products consumers in the world, the U.S. is also a substantial exporter of refined products, especially the Latin America. As you all know, during the second quarter refining utilization rates bottomed in April, which negatively impacted our propylene and octane enhancement businesses due to lower feedstock availability and a decrease in international demand. Currently the refining industry has recovered to near 80% which has facilitated an improvement in both propylene and octane enhancements. On the production side, our natural gas gathering and processing were impacted by low prices and some shut in production. While those shut ins were not insignificant, for the most part they were relatively short lived and volumes on our system are recovering. We have made substantial progress in deferring and reducing capital by a billion dollars and we continue to discuss JV opportunities, which could further reduce our capital. In addition, Graham and his folks have reduced 2020 sustaining CapEx by $100 million. That said, we have some important projects coming online over the next few months. In the third quarter, our 11th fractionator and the ECHO segment of Wink to Webster expected online. And in the fourth quarter, we expect to complete our rich gas pipeline to Carthage, add a DIB at Mont Bellevue and complete a strategic ethylene tank and pipeline build out. We continue to make strides in our petrochemical segments, which we have always described as an extension of our NGL franchise and our value chain, because we are probably the only midstream that is fairly big in the petrochemical midstream space. It is easy to underestimate the long-term strategic importance of what we are doing. Rather than being a feedstock starved olefin industry with a handful of players, the United States, especially in ethylene, has quickly moved into being the world's incremental supplier. This is really no different than what has happened in LPG over the last 10-years where the U.S. has moved from being an importer to supplying over 75% of the world's demand growth. In short, to meet the world's growing demand for primary petrochemical products, Enterprise built the world's first open access hub for polymer grade propylene. Now we have developed the first hub for ethylene. These hubs are transforming how ethylene and propylene markets transact and will create a true marketplace for the world's primary petrochemical producers, consumers, and traders. These hubs provide the essentials for an efficient market, reliable supplies, price transparency, and access to domestic and global markets. In June, we loaded a record size ethylene cargo of 44 million pounds. Then in July, we successfully loaded combination cargoes of NGLs and olefins on the same vessel, including the simultaneous loading of propane and polymer grade propylene into separate compartments on a VLGC at our Houston Ship Channel facility, as well as the simultaneous loading of ethane and ethylene on a vessel at our Morgan's Port facility. Both vessels where the first export cargoes of their kind from the U.S. Co-loading olefins on larger vessels with NGLs allows for more efficient use of dock capacity, but it also provides significant freight benefits to petrochemical export customers. I thought I would also spend a minute to talk about what we are doing to keep our business running, while keeping our people safe. We started out the quarter with much of our headquarters staff working from home, but over the last few weeks, we have been gradually bringing our headquarters personnel back into the office and are essentially staffed at this point, fully staffed. In addition to helping our employees understand social distancing, we also now require face coverings at all times in our office. It is an adjustment, but we have adjusted and thanks to our people taking personal responsibility, both in and out of the office, our case count has been minimal. I sincerely want to thank our people for their flexibility, their adjustments and their sacrifices. And I would also like to give a shout out to our operations and commercial folks that were not able to work-from-home. Plants and pipelines don't run themselves. There is no such thing as a home based control center, and the collaboration between our commercial people that we asked to be here, ask might be too soft - that we told to be here went a long way to achieving those results. I guess, finally, I would just like to say that, I think we have got the best employees in the business, and I think their performance this quarter reflects that. And I just want them to know how much they are appreciate it. Randy. The fact that our ethylene export dock is sold out also sets up in the back the demand for ethylene. I think, Jeremy, what we said last call is we thought we'd be at $500 million, $600 million in spread and I think we are probably saying for the year, we will be at the upper end of that range. I think what you are saying kind of make sense, I think you have to take a look at what a company has to work with. I emphasized petrochemicals in my opening comments because that gives us a heck of a lot more longer of the value chain to leverage, so it is about what are you having to leverage? And while one part of that value chain may be under some stress, the total won't be. Is that fair Brent? I think it always has. Yes, I think on the last call, we said that we were pretty engaged with three of those six. And not to guess, but what I could say today is we are probably pretty engaged with one of those three. It is not that you are not in discussions with the others, but it is like Randy said in this environment, everybody's just kind of pulling their horns in. So we are discussing some JVs with some of our larger projects. But I wouldn't say we are highly engaged with more than one. But we are highly engaged with one. Who wants to take that? But to cut to the chase, it is Permian centric, right? Typically they bring more than money. They have got to bring throughput or they got to bring offtake. Typically those are the kind of people we do joint ventures with. Does that answer your question? Well, I'll tell you what we wouldn't want them getting involved in, that is the church house, which I think is probably our storage system in Mont Bellevue. I don't think we have a problem with having them involved in some of our - some of the less strategic things that maybe feed the system but that is about it, that's about all we are going to say. Yes. It is a good question Shneur. I think personally, you get dislocations and you get spreads when you have events. So when crude prices fall invariably, we will see contango \u2013 I mean, it's been the way it has been. If those spreads are there then in my mind, our pipelines are probably a lot more throughput than we have today. So that is kind of way I see it. I'm probably a little more bullish than Tony is in terms of recovery. I think, I personally think demand is going to recover sooner than, probably Tony thinks it is going to recover. And I think you are going to get a price signal next year on hydrocarbons that turn some things back on. So, that is what I see. I'm going to let Randy answer that but individually there's a number of us that have accelerated our buyback program. Thank you. I would say, we've got the same answer as the first quarter. This is Jim. But Tony and Brent chime in, I think the world needs U.S. LPG and as lifestyles improve in other parts of the world, in many cases LPG is what creates that improvement. Do you have anything to add? You know I wouldn't be too quick to write off crude oil exports. We have seen quite a lot. We have seen a pick up in crude exports. I thought we had a record week as a country at one point. Hi Michael, I think we still see strength. I think what is driving it is what we talked about a while ago. What is interesting Michael is whenever we do get a cancellation, we have been pretty successful in back filling it with the supply. So the appetite is there."

            "name": "Brent Secrest",
            "content": "Yes. The one thing we have seen is just the resiliency of the Permian and part of it is just what is going on out there and part of it is how we have contracted. But, if you look at our Y-grade receipts for June, if you look at our Y-grade receipts for July, those are both records for Enterprise. And if you look at a Y-grade inventories they are at all time highs. So, in terms of how we have contracted and in terms of what we are seeing coming out of the Permian, the fractionation volumes that we have access to, those have bounced back quite nicely. Yes. \nA \u2013 James Teague: And you had another point to make. So, in our situation, yes, maybe, but we've got a value chain that we are going to leverage and we'll give them what they want, where the hot button is. We'll collect what we need at the rest of the value chain. I think there is some offset Jean Ann, and what we are seeing on ethane, is an offset on volumes, both for pipelines and for fractionation. I hear what you are saying from an industry standpoint and I will repeat myself. I think we have done a heck of a job contracting. I think how you contract and who you contract with matters in this environment. And we will say that about other commodities as well. If you look at our LPG export facility, it is in a very, very good position in terms of the contracts we have in place. And if you look at the balance of this year and you look at the following couple of years, we are in a very, very good spot. Then ultimately if supply starts going down, you look at what we have built in Mont Belvieu and the pricing points that we have. You know, I fundamentally believe that the downstream assets that we have at those pricing points benefit. So there are some offsets in this environment. This is Brent, Colton but, I think I would just say ethane has probably increased about 4%, maybe 5% across our system. And then in terms of just the whole volume metric and I'm not sure I understood the question. But where you are seeing the growth come from is obviously in Permian and I think you'll see in July some very robust volumes that come from that area. We are not seeing a whole lot. I mean, Eagle Ford has been fairly flat. There's people talking about putting up rigs. There's a certain company, that is looking to deploy some capital there that we are involved with. But I would say in the Rockies, you are seeing ethane recoveries pick up out there. And then obviously in the Permian just in terms of how aggressive we have been on contracting and just the bounce back in volumes, we are seeing the bulk of the benefits out there in that area. Yes, sir. Absolutely. Record type numbers. A couple of weeks ago I think we started going back to the highs. We're seeing just a different interest in the slate, the lighter. There is a bigger demand for West Texas light. There is a bigger demand for the Eagle Ford type barrel as people have the bid on motor gasoline and we are seeing those go to Asia, mostly Korea and some Latin America. But on the LPG side, I think we are in a good spot as Enterprise. You know, we have a project out there that we can expand when the time is right to expand. I'm not sure from a capacity standpoint, it needs to be expanded anytime soon, but certainly we have a project that is a low capital project that we can execute on. I think we are seeing a lot of PDH demand over in Asia. I think just in terms of how we contracted Michael, I say this humbly, but I think we will probably be toward the end to see any kind of drop off. I mean, we have just in terms of our supply position, in terms of the pricing point in terms of how aggressive that we have contracted out for this year and the next couple of years. We are in a good position to kind of maintain these type of levels. I think you are seeing us export, call it around 18 million barrels a month of LPGs. And I would say that's sticky. Those are sticky numbers."

            "name": "Anthony Chovanec",
            "content": "You want to talk about the production side or the demand side. Jeremy. Yes. So, obviously we had this shut in because of the price crash and chaos, and we think about a million and a half, and I will just use crude as an example of 1.5 to 1.8 million barrels came off the market. I'm kind of a numbers kind of person, not real visual, but if you look at how that production has come back, it is probably one of the steepest V's I've ever seen in statistics. So yes, we have recovered a substantial amount of it. We think that maybe 300,000 barrels will lag. And but with that said, you can't deny given the amount of declines that the shales have that momentum has changed and there is a fair amount of ground to be picked up. So, that is the reality. When we look at Y-grade coming into our system. For example, those numbers are really strong and I will let Brent address that. But when we get out to 2025 as we see it today, we will be down from where we were before, and it is not because momentum doesn't pick back up. Look, we think that we were at about 1,150 completions a month in February, and we think that as we get into 2022, that we will be at around 950. Okay. And probably completing the best of the best wells that is what is in our forecast for today. And so, when you get out to 2025, there'll be some smaller volumes than what we said before. But, Brent do you want to talk about what is going on in our business in that regard and what you are saying? On the demand side, gasoline is not really - I mean, it is off 10% to 15%, depending on what numbers you look at. Diesel is the same. And again, that is to be expected. So, if we think about going forward, what the data shows is Latin America and we are a large exporting country to Latin America, is waking back up. Moving away from being shut down and largely I think about Mexico and Brazil. So, that is a positive and we are hoping that as we work off inventories, we will put our refineries back to work. Yes. Jean Ann. Your question is, as we think about margin compression and I'm going to assume you are talking about as people re-contract on midstream assets. Is that where you are headed? Data speaks for itself Jim. You are exactly right. You look at what happened in the height of the pandemic, Brent were you blown away by the demand?"

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Randy Burkhalter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you Tina. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss first quarter earnings for 2020. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of our General Partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. There are other members of our senior management team in attendance today for the call. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management team. Although management believes that these expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements that may be made during this call. And with that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Teague: Thank you Randy. We had a record year in 2019 and our first quarter results show that last year's momentum carried into the first quarter. We reported net income of $1.4 billion or $0.61 a unit representing a 7% increase from the same quarter in 2019. Distributable cash flow totaled $1.6 billion and provided 1.6 times coverage and we retained $574 million of DCF. Then in March, everyone's world turned upside down as we were invaded by an invisible enemy, Coronavirus, officially COVID-19. This is not the first time in my lifetime that we have been invaded by an invisible enemy. I remember, as a little boy the most feared disease of the 20th century, polio. It was a highly contagious virus. It struck without warning. It paralyzed and it killed. It put people in something called an iron lung to support their breathing. People who got polio were isolated from others, quarantined, if you would. My mom, who was a registered nurse, caught polio. I remember standing outside the hospital with my little brothers and my dad so we could see her through a window. Mitigation steps were taken. Swimming pools and movie theaters were closed. We weren't allowed to go to public playgrounds. In effect, we practiced our own kind of social distancing. What I don't remember is shutting down the entire economy and 30 million people losing their jobs in one month. Just as polio was defeated, so will COVID-19, this too shall pass. It starts with changing our behavior as we have done. I have learned what social distancing is, and my hands have never been as clean as they are. As this pandemic spread, our primary objective was the safety of our people. Our secondary objective was the continuity of our business. 80% of our headquarters\u2019 people are working remotely from home. Zoom meetings are being held routinely throughout the day and throughout the company. And as I understand it, there has been a lot of Zoom happy hours after work. So even though our folks are working remotely, through technology and alcohol at happy hours, team work continues to be a part of our culture, a part of our DNA. We immediately staffed half our pipeline control people at our backup location in San Antonio. So, we are operating our pipelines out of two locations to make sure that we always have an eye on our pipe and our plants. Many of our larger facilities went to seven-on seven-off to allow for social distancing. Those of us that remained in our headquarters were disciplined in distancing and hygiene. Further, Purell has become a valuable commodity at Enterprise. I have been through many cycles in my life, but I have never seen anything like what we are going through now. Demand literally fell off a cliff in March, seems like it was overnight. As demand cratered, our good buddies Russia and Saudi Arabia piled on by pumping an additional 4 million barrels a day of crude oil into the market and the result was what no one would have ever guessed, negative price crude oil. At Enterprise, we immediately adjusted to this reality. Our operations people have gone into a managed cost mode. Our commercial groups have reduced CapEx from almost $4 billion in 2020 to $2.5 billion , $1 billion of which has already been spent. Six potential joint ventures are being negotiated, which could further reduce CapEx. In our businesses, our LPG exports continue to be virtually sold out. In fact, May with a little luck could be a record month. Three NGO wells at Mont Belvieu have been converted to refined products. Tanks have been converted to crude oil services. Our people have found places to store crude oil that two months ago we didn't even know existed. To enhance our financial flexibility, we did a $1 billion credit facility to bring our liquidity to almost $8 billion. All of this and much more is being done to succeed in this environment. Chaos leads to inefficient markets, which leads to volatility. We don't fear volatility. We embrace it and inefficient markets work to our strength. Some of our businesses are steady as a rock. Our NGL fractionators are full and will remain so. And our NGL pipelines, overall, haven't seen a downturn. Our Permian crude oil pipelines are fully contracted, and Seaway is virtually full. Our petrochemical business is challenged as motor gasoline demand has fallen and refinery runs have been cut. Once refinery runs improve, so will our petrochemicals. Natural gas throughput on our Texas and Louisiana intrastate pipelines have been full. While our natural gas processing has suffered, this is a business that I believe has potential upside in the second half of the year. Opportunities around our assets are abundant. Our storages work as wait and go, as there is contango on every hydrocarbon, and we have even seen some cases of backwardation and there are location differentials around our pipelines. It's anyone's guess as to when the economy will open and things return to normal. During this time, our people are driven to continue to perform to deliver the results that create the value they have always delivered. I will give a personal perspective. As a young naval officer in an attack helicopter squadron in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, I took a great deal of pride that I was part of a special fraternity. It took a long time to have that feeling again. But I have that same kind of pride today being a part of this fraternity. At Enterprise, everyone understands the mission and understands their role in accomplishing the mission. The mission, add value. How we add value may change, but we always add value. In closing, we want every member of the Enterprise family to know how much we appreciate all that you do. You are this company's greatest asset. You are what makes this a special fraternity. And with that, I will turn the call over to Randy.\nRandy Fowler: Thank you Jim, and good morning everyone. I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings support slides are posted on our website for your reference. Starting with income statement items for the first quarter, as Jim mentioned, net income attributable to limited partners for the first quarter 2020 was $1.4 billion or $0.61 per unit on a fully diluted basis. Net income for the first quarter included $187 million or $0.08 per unit benefit in deferred tax expense associated with the settlement of the liquidity option on March 5 in subsequent accounting for a related deferred tax liability. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $2 billion for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $1.2 billion for the first quarter of 2019. Excluding changes in working capital accounts, cash flow from operations for the first quarter of 2020 was 3% lower than the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2020, which we define as cash flow from operations minus investing activities plus any contributions from non-controlling interest, was $916 million. Free cash flow was $3.4 billion for the last 12 months ended March 2020, which was 78% higher than the $1.9 billion reported for the last 12 months ending March 2019. We define payout ratio as the sum of cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from operations. Our payout ratio was approximately 56% for the first quarter of 2020 cash flow from operations. In January, we provided guidance that we expected to increase our distribution related to the first quarter of 2020 by 0.25% to $0.4475 per unit. Given the economic sudden stop and uncertainty related to Coronavirus, we thought it was prudent to hold our distribution flat at $0.445. It will be paid on May 12. This distribution represents a 1.7% increase when compared to the same quarter of 2019. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, it will be delivered and our Board will evaluate our distribution growth quarterly in 2020. With respect to buybacks, we purchased $140 million of common units during the first quarter of 2020, substantially all prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, which is 6.4 million unit reduction. Additionally EPD's distribution reinvestment plan and the employee unit purchase plan purchased a total of 1.4 million EPD units in the open market in the first quarter and affiliates of our general partner purchased approximately 1.5 million units in the open market during the first quarter of 2020. Now moving on capital expenditures. As Jim mentioned, we effectively reduced 2020 capital expenditures by $1.1 billion in our initial review. We now anticipate spending between $2.5 billion and $3 billion in growth capital projects this year. We currently expect growth capital investments for 2021 and 2022 to be approximately $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, based solely on sanctioned projects already approved. As Jim also mentioned, we are currently in negotiations on joint ventures, which could lead to a further reduction in growth capital expenditures for 2020, 2021 and 2022. We currently expect sustaining capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $300 million, which is a $100 million reduction from previous guidance. Total capital investments in the first quarter of 2020 were $1.1 billion, which includes $69 million of sustaining capital expenditures. Turning to capitalization. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, 2020. Assuming the first call date of our hybrids and as well as the final maturity date, the average life of our debt portfolio is 16.1 years and 20.2 years, respectively. Our average effective cost of debt is 4.5%. As mentioned on our last quarterly call, we completed our issuance of 10-year, 31-year and 40-year notes in January 2020. The aggregate amount of that issuance was $3 billion. We are very appreciative for the continued strong support from our term debt investors in this offering. Currently we do not expect to have the need to return to the debt capital markets in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12-months ended March 31, 2020 was $8.1 billion and our net consolidated leverage ratio was 3.3 times after adjusting debt for partial equity credit in the hybrid debt securities given by the rating agencies and further reduced for unrestricted cash. Our consolidated liability was approximately $7 billion at March 31, 2020, including availability under our existing credit facilities and approximately $2 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. As of today, our liquidity is approximately $8 billion with additional liquidity provided by the new 364-day facility entered into on April 3. We are grateful for the support and responsiveness of our bank group in providing us additional flexibility during this time. We anticipate elevated uses of working capital in the near term for contango opportunities. Regarding our cash balance, our only remaining debt maturity in 2020 is a $1 billion maturity of 5.2% notes due in September. I would like to thank our employees, many of who were challenged to work from home while maintaining their same level of productivity. I would like to thank them for their efforts not only in our business continuity but also in the comprehensive SOX testing at our accounting controls and processes that attest the earnings we announce today and the 10-Q that will be filed on May 8. I want to take a minute to speak to the durability of our business as we see it currently. Our top 200 customers represented 96% of 2019 revenues. 78% of the revenues from our top 200 customers were comprised of investment-grade customers or those backed by letter of credit. This is based on public debt ratings through April 23, 2020. So it takes into consideration three of our formally investment-grade customers that have become high-yield fallen angels in the past few weeks. Only 11% of the revenues from our top 200 customers represented independent E&P companies. Our earnings are typically 80% to 90% fee-based depending on the commodity price and spread environment. When we break down the fee-based areas, we compartmentalize those into three broad categories. The first, take-or-pay or minimum volume commitments, which comprise 45% to 55% of our fee-based earnings. Second, durable fee earnings which we think of as storage throughput and wholesale residential deliveries make up another 20% to 30%. Fee earnings with more volumetric exposures such as wellhead dedication and certain demand base volumes make up the balance. Even within our volumetric based earnings, we have a high degree of competence in a lot of the earnings capture given the many ways our commercial and operational teams have hustled to keep our assets full such as repurposing storage and pipeline assets. Finally, I would like to iterate our financial objectives as to defend and maintain our distribution, our strong balance sheet and our debt rate, maintain ample liquidity and continue to high grade and invest in projects underwritten by high credit quality customers, long term fee-based contracts and underpinned by solid long term fundamentals. Before I turn the call over to Randy, we would like to thank our long-term investors for their feedback, confidence and support through these volatile times. To all of you and your families, stay safe.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay. Tina, this is Randy. We are ready to take questions from listeners. But before we do, I would like to remind them that please just limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. Okay. Tina, thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni. Please go ahead.\nShneur Gershuni: Good morning everyone.\nJim Teague: Good morning.\nShneur Gershuni: Maybe to start off here, and I do appreciate all the comments that you made in the prepared remarks, but I was wondering if you can talk about the current environment as when I say current, I mean with respect April versus let\u2019s say February, how things are going from a volumetric perspective on your traditional fee-based and pops business? I am not specifically talking about the spread differential business, but how are things going with respect to that business, as there\u2019s been accelerated rig declines and talks of shut-ins and so forth? How materially worse do you think volumes are going to be in the second quarter if they are consistent with where they are today, let's say?\nJim Teague: Well, this is Jim. I think I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks, so far our, for example, our LPG export facility is pretty full, Brent, and it has been. I think I said that our crude oil pipelines, if you look at our crude oil pipelines out of the Permian, do we expect some downturn in production? Yes. But those crude oil pipelines, I think we have 1.5 million half barrels a day of contracts, Brent. They are all take-or-pay contracts and they all have associated dock deals. Some of them storage deals that are all take-or-pay, and as Randy said, they are all investment-grade. From an NGL perspective, we are seeing on the supply side, we are seeing some slight downturns, but on the demand side we are seeing increases. Where I think we are probably most challenged right now is our petrochemicals as refinery runs have been cut. But I see upside on that as refinery runs increase. I think our petrochemical business in the second half will do a hell of a lot better than it's doing now. Brent, you have got anything else?\nBrent Secrest: No. I think you hit it. I mean on the flow side, we will have a record month for LPGs in April. We will have close to record in May, maybe a little bit less than April. And as we go out further, you could see some effects on production declines. But in the end, our dock space is over 90% contracted for LPGs and crude oil for take-or-pay. So, we haven't seen big drop-offs yet. I think maybe on the G&P side, we will see some volume decline on that side. But in terms of the customers that we deal with, if you look at the barrels that are going to be cut out, the barrel that's the highest cost to produce will be first. The second barrel that will probably get cut out is that the highest cost to get to market. And then the third will be some sort of a quality issue. So, if you look at our system and our customer base, I think we are, I don't want to say we will be the last ones to see reduction in volume, but I think they are pretty well positioned in terms of our customer base to keep on producing it at some sort of level.\nShneur Gershuni: That makes perfect sense. Really appreciate the color there. Maybe as a follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you talked about an attempt to reduce expenses and you also talked about keeping the distribution flat. Just kind of thinking that on a go-forward basis, are you able to handicap how sizable your O&M and G&A expense reductions to be on a go-forward basis? And does the commentary about keeping the distribution flat also remove the objective about a 2% buyback target from CFFO as well too or is that still in place?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Shneur, on the buyback target, the company bought back $140 million worth of units in the first quarter. And if we use last year's cash flow from operations as a guide, 2% of that number was about $130 million, $140 million. So, I think we have pretty much addressed that. I think for a long time, the way we return capital to investors is consistent distribution growth. And again this year, we added the additional component of doing the buybacks. But I think right now, there is just too much uncertainty at this point in time with this economic sudden stop and how long does the effects of this Coronavirus last on the broader economy and energy demand. So, I think we will take a look quarterly as the Board meets and see how the business performs.\nShneur Gershuni: Any comments on the costs?\nRandy Fowler: What did you say?\nJim Teague: Comments on the cost, G&A.\nRandy Fowler: Well, our folks Graham Bacon back in operations is focused on reducing OpEx and sustaining CapEx. And I think I don't know how to answer the fact that we are hyper focused on cost and we are hyper focused on CapEx. So, I don't have an answer to it other than that.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much and remember to stay safe and stay sane.\nRandy Fowler: Thank you.\nJim Teague: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nChristine Cho: Good morning. Thanks for all the color. If I could start with exports, can you just remind us how you are contracted on the export side for crude, LPG, ethane, and ethylene relative to the capacities? How much above the MVCs are the volumes currently? And I know you guys have also historically said that you pay a deficiency -- or the customers have to pay a deficiency charge if they don't pick up the volumes or they cancel. How much lower is that rate relative to if they were to pick up the volume?\nBrent Secrest: Christine, this is Brent Secrest. So, on a high level for LPGs, the contracts and as you go out further in time, this percentage goes down slightly. But on the LPGs side, over 90% are take-or-pay. If for some reason, the vessel doesn't show up, there is a payment that's made to Enterprise that is essentially an offset to what it would be for us to operate and recover our variable costs. So, there is kind of a fixed reservation. There is a reservation component and then there is a -- if they do show up with the vessel, there is a variable component that offsets our variable costs, and that varies contract-by-contract and term-by-term. On the crude side, again the volume is over 90%. The duration on our crude contracts is actually longer than the LPG side and that component is take-or-pay, and there is no sort of offset. It is take-or-pay whether the vessel shows up or does not show up, the fee is essentially the same. On the ethylene side, I am looking at Chris D'Anna next to me. All those, I think it's almost on 100%, 90% to 100%, Chris, that are being contracted as take-or-pay?\nChristopher D'Anna: That's correct Brent. 95% of our capacity has been contracted as take-or-pay. And it's set up similar to how NGLs, where there is a fee and there is a component that is basically the variable cost if they don't show up, the take-or-pay basically keeps us whole on the fee.\nBrent Secrest: When it comes to exports, I would let Jim or Randy correct me, but from a variability to our earnings as it relates to exports, it's essentially what you are talking about as some sort of, call it, walk up opportunity we would have on volume. It's pretty much set in stone.\nChristine Cho: Okay. Thank you. That's really helpful, and maybe if can just follow up to Shneur's question about the cost, how do we think about what sort of cost savings we could potentially see in the event of a prolonged return? Midstream assets seem to just generally be a high fixed cost business. And so, the more notable cost savings seems to come from shutting down processing plants or non-Mont Belvieu frac facilities or maybe a pump station on a pipeline to better optimize the system, but is there anything else we should be thinking about just beyond the standard G&A cuts?\nGraham Bacon: This is Graham. We look at all aspects of how we operate our systems in terms of overall cost reduction. As Jim said, we are hyper focused on variable cost reduction, whether it be how much power we use for a pump station operation. If there is declining volumes from fixed cost. So we have a number of strategies that we use to reduce and extend our maintenance cost. We have a strong focus on reliability and predictive maintenance. And we use those tools and all the things we have got help us to really run our cost and manage those costs. And we don't put a lot of targets out there. But certainly, I think from a standpoint, where we are looking sustainable, we can go 10% or lower for some period of time.\nChristine Cho: Thank you.\nRandy Fowler: And Christine, our travel and entertainment expenses are down too.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tristan Richardson with SunTrust. Please go ahead.\nTristan Richardson: Hi. Good morning guys. Just curious, can you talk conceptually about the range of CapEx for 2021 seemingly unchanged from where you talk about general opportunity set in any given year? I mean the deferrals you saw in 2020 or the deferrals you made in 2020 pushed into 2021 that's keeping that elevated? Or is it just to say that the project outlook for 2021 is largely unchanged from where you see in any given normal year?\nJim Teague: Why don't you start, I will jump in.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Tristan, pretty much it was a combination of things because we had some projects that the capital expenditures were deferred. So yes, some moved from 2020 into 2021. But we had some that were indefinitely deferred, so they dropped out of 2020 and 2021. So it was a little bit of a combination of both.\nTristan Richardson: Helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just conceptually at a high level, could you about a CapEx floor for Enterprise? Where CapEx could be in any given year? Where only the most critical and essential projects are go ahead? Or what that could look like in any given year?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Tristan, we are in a pretty unusual time right now. I would say, if we think about base level of opportunities, it seems like invariably, we have opportunities to come in and debottleneck the system or come in and reduce costs. And they can be $10 million, $25 million, $50 million to throw. And all of a sudden, in a whole year, it adds up to $250 million to $500 million. So we have those type opportunities. As we think of things right now on the horizon, we don't see a lot of opportunities facing from the upstream side of our customer base, but we could very well see some opportunities on the downstream side and on the demand pull side as well. So I think as you are thinking about it, probably something in the $1 billion, $1.5 billion opportunity from a growth CapEx is a good base level.\nTristan Richardson: Helpful. Thank you guys very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from T.J. Schultz with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nT.J. Schultz: Hi. Good morning. You talked about finding new storage capacity throughout your system. How much available crude storage capacity or what percentage of your capacity is not contracted that's available for contango?\nJim Teague: More than I thought. Brent, take it.\nBrent Secrest: Yes. I mean that's fairly sensitive in my opinion. So in terms how we are going to contract this stuff, there is a chance for us to have some opportunities long term with people that it's probably not going to be a different approach than how we did some of our crude oil pipelines as there is some short term opportunity and if it made sense for us and it made sense for the customer, we did long term deals on the pipeline side of the Permian. So what may have not looked so great early on, looks pretty good now in the case of storage. It's a balance, frankly, of us trying to secure long term deals and then take advantage of the opportunity. But in terms of specific numbers, I will just echo Jim. You take hard look to your business and you get a lot of people involved and you find things that frankly you forgot about. And we have been pleasantly surprised with how much crude oil storage that we have access to.\nJim Teague: Refer back to my script notes, we take our storage as worth its weight in gold.\nBrent Secrest: And T.J., I think one other thing that we talk, it was just three months ago, feels like it's three years ago when we had our fourth quarter earnings call. We talked about in 2019, we had what we would call outsized spread capture in 2019 that we thought it maybe $500 million to $600 million of that would not repeat in 2020. We have the potential to come in and have that kind of number again in 2020.\nJim Teague: That's a good answer.\nT.J. Schultz: Okay. Good. Thanks for that. Just on the follow-up for JVs. I think you mentioned six potential JVs are in discussion right now. Have those conversations, just given what's happened in the market, have those shifted, accelerated, slowed down at this point? And are you talking to more strategic or financial partners? Thanks.\nJim Teague: Well, first of all, we are talking to strategic partners. And secondly, yes, we are in discussions with six. I would say three of those are highly engaged.\nT.J. Schultz: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pearce Hammond with Simmons Energy. Please go ahead.\nPearce Hammond: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. And Jim, I appreciate your prepared remarks. That was really interesting. My first question pertains to force majeure. Are you experiencing any force majeure calls on take-or-pay contracts? And assuming we fill full oil storage and producers have no place to ship the crude, could that be a reason that they call for a force majeure?\nJim Teague: We would call that a price majeure and that's not in our contracts. We have looked at all our contracts and we feel pretty comfortable that we are not going to have any issue with force majeures as it relates to price.\nPearce Hammond: Okay. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up is, what is your outlook for U.S. oil and LPG exports over the next two years? And could you see a situation whereby some of your oil export capacity gets repurposed to LPG exports?\nJim Teague: I will take a shot and then Brent and Tony might follow-up. Yes, I think in our LPG export facility, I feel pretty good about that for this year. I don't know who the hell can answer you on crude oil. Fortunately, we have got a most of our crude deals are take-or-pay at the dog. Brent, I think you said 90%. But it really boils down to when does this economy come back? Now, in terms of storage, I just fundamentally don't believe that you fill up storage. Something always happens that creates an outlet or stops production. I think Brent, we have seen here recently, we were exporting what, a million barrels a day of crude plus before this and then all of a sudden everything stopped. But now, I think we are getting calls and starting to do some deals on crude exports.\nBrent Secrest: Yes, I mean if you look at first quarter, we are on pace to track the same numbers as second quarter. But you know, if there is this is pace to be made and I understand it that production declines, then by default, I would say that crude exports are going to decline. I just think a lot of this crude exports are walk-up opportunities for other terminals. I would think that if people have take-or-pay contracts with us, I don't think you will see a big impact on volumes on our side and certainly not going to see a big impact on dollars on our side. In the case of trying to reconvert crude LPG, I think that sounds much simpler than it is. I mean it's essentially a dock is what you gain. And if crude oil production declines, you are going to make the assumption that NGL production will go with it. Now you may see different basins that return that aren't crude-centric. So I would think along those lines. There may be a resurgence in some of those basins that maybe value or have NGLs and gas. So I think there's some opportunity there for us.\nPearce Hammond: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the major CapEx in 2021 and beyond. As someone noted before, it looks like a lot of it has been deferred and I think that that's what the blue check market means. I am just wondering if that some of the bigger ticket items like PDH 2 and Midland-to-ECHO 4, we should think of it as still being cancelable if you choose to do so? Or if there are just major penalties for doing that?\nJim Teague: Yes. Both of those projects are underwritten with long term contracts. So in our mind, not cancelable.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. Fair enough. And then I think on May 5 that Texas RRC will decide about whether there is a Texas cut. Would this impact take-or-pay contracts?\nJim Teague: The answer to that is no. And I don't believe for a minute they are going to do anything in terms of prorationing production.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. Very clear. That's all for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the $1 billion CapEx cut for this year. It seems like the major sort of capital projects are only delayed really slightly and the isom was canceled. So how much of the $1 billion of changes to kind of the major projects you guys lay out versus just the environment less need for well connects and smaller things on the margin that you are able to pull out of the budget?\nJim Teague: Yes. And I am sorry. Could you repeat your question one more time?\nKeith Stanley: The $1 billion CapEx cut. I am wondering how much of that is from the major projects you lay out in your slides, which are really only delayed slightly versus other things just in the environment where you could have fewer well connects and just smaller projects that normally support producer growth?\nJim Teague: Yes. I would say, a significant amount of it was attributable to the larger projects. If you would, there was a bucket of other projects that may have accounted for $200 million, $300 million.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. That's helpful. Second question, just on the C-Corp question. I am just curious how recent events have impacted your thought process which obviously the sector selling off very hard, closed-end fund issues, but then I guess on the other side you have federal deficits really kind of exploding here. Just any updated thoughts on how you think about the C-Corp question given what's happened in the world over the past few months?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. I will be honest. Really that hasn't been our priority is to come in and evaluate MLP versus C-Corp here the last few weeks. It's really about executing on the business in these uncertain times and getting us positioned from a liquidity standpoint and to take advantage of funding some of these contango opportunities. I think you hit on some key things there. I mean, it seems like invariably you can have some investor turnover. I think MLPs had our fair share of it here over the last six weeks. But if I come in and I think you hit on a key point, I think everybody is going to pay more in income taxes including C-Corps going down the roads. We will see what happens there. Somebody has got to pay the tab for all these $1 trillion stimulus packages. But also I think frankly what surprised me was some of the volatility and the C-Corp names that we saw some of those names just plummet. But we have not gone into a deep dive or any kind of reevaluation.\nJim Teague: I think what he just said is, we have been too damn busy.\nKeith Stanley: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nSpiro Dounis: Hi. Good morning everyone. Just want to start off on strategy. You all have been slightly more aggressive or taking a slightly more aggressive approach leading into this downturn and if we are focused on capturing more market share, Jim, earlier you mentioned embracing volatility. So just curious, has anything really changed or does anything change that approach? And do you actually see an ability here to accelerate market share capture in this environment, either organically or through M&A?\nJim Teague: I guess, it was hard to understand the question.\nSpiro Dounis: Yes. You guys. Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead, Randy.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. If you could repeat your question one more time, maybe just a little bit louder?\nSpiro Dounis: No problem. So you guys have been fairly aggressive leading into this. It sounds like you were trying to capture market share, getting really competitive on pricing and some re-contracting to attract more customers. So just curious in this environment, you just sort of bolster everything up. Does that change at all? Jim, you had mentioned embracing volatility here. So just curious, do you go out there with the same aggressive approach and try and capture more of that market share? And is there an organic path there? Or do you see some opportunities here on the M&A side to actually pick up some assets?\nJim Teague: Yes. I don't think there is an M&A that we would look at right now. And yes, I think we talked about on our LPG export dock. If you go and compete with us, you better be willing to get down and dirty. And we contracted that dock out. I think we kept a couple of spots a month. And then in terms of embracing volatility, we have got a 20-year track record of creating value. And sometimes that comes in different forms. I am not sure how much credit we get for it. But when we say embrace volatility, we have benefited from crude falling on the floor, refined products, LPG. We have a footprint that lends itself to having opportunities that in normal circumstances aren't there. And that's been the case through hurricanes and financial meltdowns and now through Coronavirus.\nSpiro Dounis: Understood. And just going back to the potential for future CapEx cuts as it relates to joint ventures. One maybe specifically focused around Midland-to-ECHO 3 and the connection there Wink to Webster. I guess my understanding there is that pipeline is some of the steel has been ordered already, some of it is actually in the ground and I imagine that one falls into a largely underwritten asset that moves forward. I am just curious what maybe options you have there around changing the scope or size? Are there options available to you? And then obviously you guys also have some idle pipelines or some pipeline optionality to move volumes there instead. Are those some of the things that are being discussed right now?\nJim Teague: Yes. We can reduce CapEx by entering into joint ventures on assets that are in virtually every one of our businesses, none of which touches the assets.\nSpiro Dounis: All right. Thank you everyone.\nOperator: Your next question is from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nGabe Moreen: Hi. Good morning everyone. Just had a couple of follow-up questions on the potential joint ventures. One is really on use of proceeds there. Is it fair to say that that's strictly going to deleveraging at this point? Or could there be some other form of capital to return? And then also depending on which JVs are you able to get going, can you talk about whether or not some of the projects would go from, I guess, to what's shaded in blue to actually I mean being accelerated, if you are potentially able to get something going commercially depending on the terms?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Gabe, on the first part, I think any use of proceeds that we had, whether it would be incremental areas where we may see additional room to reduce CapEx in 2020 or if there was any proceeds from any JV opportunities, it would really just come in and go to delevering. At this point in time, again, any other return on capital, be it through distribution growth or be it through incremental buyback, really we need to get more visibility of what the macroeconomic backdrop looks like and what the demand for energy looks like before we make any other decisions on that. And Gabe, what was the second part of your question?\nGabe Moreen: Yes. It was just on whether some of the JVs that you are negotiating for some of those projects which you have shaded in blue, which you have deferred. So depending on how the JV works out, could those potentially be brought, I mean, I guess brought back --\nRandy Fowler: Yes. And Gabe on that one, that's where Jim said, with these discussions, it's for assets across all four segments.\nGabe Moreen: Okay. And then Randy, I just had one follow-up in terms of the marketing opportunities you talked about and the working capital draw. I don't know if you care to talk about how large that working capital usage might be. I realize that's sort of a dynamic number. And then also, can you just talk about maybe the cadence of when you might recognize those marketing earnings in 2020? I assume it's the back half type of the year recognition.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. I will let Jim or Brent hit the timing of the earnings. I think the one benefit from low commodity prices is it doesn't take a lot of working capital to execute on contango.\nJim Teague: Yes. I think we are going to see, in the past, we have had some rather large contango opportunities at $16, $17 crude oil. The working capital is a hell of a lot less. And the way we do in contango, by and large is where do you get the biggest spread. I mean I think it's probably going to be throughout the year. Brent?\nBrent Secrest: Yes. Certain commodities we have targeted closer to the front. And other commodities, frankly, we have kind of spread it out based on liquidity and some other things. But I think for the balance of the year, you are going to see these numbers show up month-by-month.\nGabe Moreen: Got it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And your next question is from Ujjwal Pradhan with Bank of America.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Good morning everyone. This is Ujjwal. Thanks for taking my question. First one, just following up on your earlier comments around share repurchase. So maybe to ask the question a little differently, how do you view the appropriate distribution yield on your units in the current environment? And how that informs your buyback program beyond the plan to repurchase 2% of 2020 cash flow from operations?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. As far as the distribution growth question goes, we have been public since 1998 and we have provided distribution growth in every year since our IPO. So that's been one of our objectives over time is to provide consistent distribution growth. And so that's been important, it was over time. But you may have asked the question a different way, I am probably going to go back to the same answer. Given the uncertainty, again, this economic sudden stop that we have had on a global basis, it's historic. And just there is a lot of uncertainty of how the next three months, six months are going to progress. And I think we just need to have more visibility of how that's going to progress before we make any decisions about returning any additional capital above what we are doing now to investors at this point. I think this is a point where you really come in and protect your balance sheet, protect your debt rating, come in and protect your liquidity. And we have got a lot of good opportunities that our assets set us up for. And right now we are in execution mode big time over the next three, six, nine months.\nUjjwal Pradhan: Thank you. I appreciate your thoughts there. And my second question is regarding your PE reversal, the partial reversal plan. Can you discuss how that came about despite Cushing already filling up rapidly? And what sort of uplift you expect from that reversal?\nJim Teague: Brent?\nBrent Secrest: Yes. This is Brent Secrest. That basically came about because you guys saw what was going on in the market and there was a flight to storage. And that was the open access storage and frankly that was where people were buying crude oil, whether that was financially or what have you. We look at our customer base and our Permian producers and our Eagle Ford producers ultimately wanted access to market. And some of them approached us to figure out if that could still be reversed. Graham Bacon and his team figured it out how to do it very cost efficiently and quickly. There was a lot of things still in place. So that was the thought behind that. And it just led to another optimization opportunity on our side and also a solution for our customers.\nRandy Burkhalter: Tina, this is Randy Burkhalter. Given the fact we have got calls coming up after ours and I apologize for anybody in the queue that couldn't get in, but we are going to take one more question before we end our call today.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering & Holt. Please go ahead.\nColton Bean: Thanks. I will keep it brief here. So just to circle back to LPG exports, I think you all noted that May was shaping up to be a record month. Any detail in terms of where those cargos are headed or preliminary discussions around June?\nJim Teague: I think they are by and large going to Asia, South America. I doubt if anything and I don't think anything is going to Europe that I know of.\nBrent Secrest: It's mainly things that are geographically advantaged. I would say the one big area of uptick that we saw was India and Indonesia. But certainly, India had an increase on what they were bringing in.\nColton Bean: Got it. Appreciate that. And then, Brent, maybe just to follow-up on some of your comments there around when and why we would see production curtailed. As you look across your system, is it really South Texas and the Permian that you would expect to be most exposed? Or are there any other maybe more nuanced regions that have rich gas exposure that you are keeping an eye on?\nBrent Secrest: I would say Delaware Basin light. You saw with differentials did out there. That became challenged for a little while. Eagle Ford condensate as certain buyers stepped away from the market. And then frankly, I see some opportunities that are going to offset that. And whether that's the Rockies or potentially Haynesville, some of those areas I think are going to have a resurgence.\nColton Bean: Okay. I will leave it there. I appreciate the time.\nJim Teague: Okay. Tina, before we end the call, would you give our listeners the replay information. And then let me just say thank you again for joining us today. And from Enterprise, we are going to go ahead and get off the call. And again, if you could give the replay information. Thank you.\nOperator: On a replay information, you may dial (1800)-859-2056, access code 9879389. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Jim Teague",
            "content": "Thank you Randy. We had a record year in 2019 and our first quarter results show that last year's momentum carried into the first quarter. We reported net income of $1.4 billion or $0.61 a unit representing a 7% increase from the same quarter in 2019. Distributable cash flow totaled $1.6 billion and provided 1.6 times coverage and we retained $574 million of DCF. Then in March, everyone's world turned upside down as we were invaded by an invisible enemy, Coronavirus, officially COVID-19. This is not the first time in my lifetime that we have been invaded by an invisible enemy. I remember, as a little boy the most feared disease of the 20th century, polio. It was a highly contagious virus. It struck without warning. It paralyzed and it killed. It put people in something called an iron lung to support their breathing. People who got polio were isolated from others, quarantined, if you would. My mom, who was a registered nurse, caught polio. I remember standing outside the hospital with my little brothers and my dad so we could see her through a window. Mitigation steps were taken. Swimming pools and movie theaters were closed. We weren't allowed to go to public playgrounds. In effect, we practiced our own kind of social distancing. What I don't remember is shutting down the entire economy and 30 million people losing their jobs in one month. Just as polio was defeated, so will COVID-19, this too shall pass. It starts with changing our behavior as we have done. I have learned what social distancing is, and my hands have never been as clean as they are. As this pandemic spread, our primary objective was the safety of our people. Our secondary objective was the continuity of our business. 80% of our headquarters' people are working remotely from home. Zoom meetings are being held routinely throughout the day and throughout the company. And as I understand it, there has been a lot of Zoom happy hours after work. So even though our folks are working remotely, through technology and alcohol at happy hours, team work continues to be a part of our culture, a part of our DNA. We immediately staffed half our pipeline control people at our backup location in San Antonio. So, we are operating our pipelines out of two locations to make sure that we always have an eye on our pipe and our plants. Many of our larger facilities went to seven-on seven-off to allow for social distancing. Those of us that remained in our headquarters were disciplined in distancing and hygiene. Further, Purell has become a valuable commodity at Enterprise. I have been through many cycles in my life, but I have never seen anything like what we are going through now. Demand literally fell off a cliff in March, seems like it was overnight. As demand cratered, our good buddies Russia and Saudi Arabia piled on by pumping an additional 4 million barrels a day of crude oil into the market and the result was what no one would have ever guessed, negative price crude oil. At Enterprise, we immediately adjusted to this reality. Our operations people have gone into a managed cost mode. Our commercial groups have reduced CapEx from almost $4 billion in 2020 to $2.5 billion , $1 billion of which has already been spent. Six potential joint ventures are being negotiated, which could further reduce CapEx. In our businesses, our LPG exports continue to be virtually sold out. In fact, May with a little luck could be a record month. Three NGO wells at Mont Belvieu have been converted to refined products. Tanks have been converted to crude oil services. Our people have found places to store crude oil that two months ago we didn't even know existed. To enhance our financial flexibility, we did a $1 billion credit facility to bring our liquidity to almost $8 billion. All of this and much more is being done to succeed in this environment. Chaos leads to inefficient markets, which leads to volatility. We don't fear volatility. We embrace it and inefficient markets work to our strength. Some of our businesses are steady as a rock. Our NGL fractionators are full and will remain so. And our NGL pipelines, overall, haven't seen a downturn. Our Permian crude oil pipelines are fully contracted, and Seaway is virtually full. Our petrochemical business is challenged as motor gasoline demand has fallen and refinery runs have been cut. Once refinery runs improve, so will our petrochemicals. Natural gas throughput on our Texas and Louisiana intrastate pipelines have been full. While our natural gas processing has suffered, this is a business that I believe has potential upside in the second half of the year. Opportunities around our assets are abundant. Our storages work as wait and go, as there is contango on every hydrocarbon, and we have even seen some cases of backwardation and there are location differentials around our pipelines. It's anyone's guess as to when the economy will open and things return to normal. During this time, our people are driven to continue to perform to deliver the results that create the value they have always delivered. I will give a personal perspective. As a young naval officer in an attack helicopter squadron in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, I took a great deal of pride that I was part of a special fraternity. It took a long time to have that feeling again. But I have that same kind of pride today being a part of this fraternity. At Enterprise, everyone understands the mission and understands their role in accomplishing the mission. The mission, add value. How we add value may change, but we always add value. In closing, we want every member of the Enterprise family to know how much we appreciate all that you do. You are this company's greatest asset. You are what makes this a special fraternity. And with that, I will turn the call over to Randy. Good morning. Well, this is Jim. I think I've said in my prepared remarks, so far our, for example, our LPG export facility is pretty full, Brent, and it has been. I think I said that our crude oil pipelines, if you look at our crude oil pipelines out of the Permian, do we expect some downturn in production? Yes. But those crude oil pipelines, I think we have 1.5 million half barrels a day of contracts, Brent. They are all take-or-pay contracts and they all have associated dock deals. Some of them storage deals that are all take-or-pay, and as Randy said, they are all investment-grade. From an NGL perspective, we are seeing on the supply side, we are seeing some slight downturns, but on the demand side we are seeing increases. Where I think we are probably most challenged right now is our petrochemicals as refinery runs have been cut. But I see upside on that as refinery runs increase. I think our petrochemical business in the second half will do a hell of a lot better than it's doing now. Brent, you have got anything else? Comments on the cost, G&A. Thank you. Why don't you start, I will jump in. More than I thought. Brent, take it. Refer back to my script notes, we take our storage as worth its weight in gold. That's a good answer. Well, first of all, we are talking to strategic partners. And secondly, yes, we are in discussions with six. I would say three of those are highly engaged. We would call that a price majeure and that's not in our contracts. We have looked at all our contracts and we feel pretty comfortable that we are not going to have any issue with force majeures as it relates to price. I will take a shot and then Brent and Tony might follow-up. Yes, I think in our LPG export facility, I feel pretty good about that for this year. I don't know who the hell can answer you on crude oil. Fortunately, we have got a most of our crude deals are take-or-pay at the dog. Brent, I think you said 90%. But it really boils down to when does this economy come back? Now, in terms of storage, I just fundamentally don't believe that you fill up storage. Something always happens that creates an outlet or stops production. I think Brent, we have seen here recently, we were exporting what, a million barrels a day of crude plus before this and then all of a sudden everything stopped. But now, I think we are getting calls and starting to do some deals on crude exports. Yes. Both of those projects are underwritten with long term contracts. So in our mind, not cancelable. The answer to that is no. And I don't believe for a minute they are going to do anything in terms of prorationing production. Yes. And I am sorry. Could you repeat your question one more time? Yes. I would say, a significant amount of it was attributable to the larger projects. If you would, there was a bucket of other projects that may have accounted for $200 million, $300 million. I think what he just said is, we have been too damn busy. I guess, it was hard to understand the question. Yes. I don't think there is an M&A that we would look at right now. And yes, I think we talked about on our LPG export dock. If you go and compete with us, you better be willing to get down and dirty. And we contracted that dock out. I think we kept a couple of spots a month. And then in terms of embracing volatility, we have got a 20-year track record of creating value. And sometimes that comes in different forms. I am not sure how much credit we get for it. But when we say embrace volatility, we have benefited from crude falling on the floor, refined products, LPG. We have a footprint that lends itself to having opportunities that in normal circumstances aren't there. And that's been the case through hurricanes and financial meltdowns and now through Coronavirus. Yes. We can reduce CapEx by entering into joint ventures on assets that are in virtually every one of our businesses, none of which touches the assets. Yes. I think we are going to see, in the past, we have had some rather large contango opportunities at $16, $17 crude oil. The working capital is a hell of a lot less. And the way we do in contango, by and large is where do you get the biggest spread. I mean I think it's probably going to be throughout the year. Brent? Brent? I think they are by and large going to Asia, South America. I doubt if anything and I don't think anything is going to Europe that I know of. Okay. Tina, before we end the call, would you give our listeners the replay information. And then let me just say thank you again for joining us today. And from Enterprise, we are going to go ahead and get off the call. And again, if you could give the replay information. Thank you."

            "name": "Randy Fowler",
            "content": "Thank you Jim, and good morning everyone. I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings support slides are posted on our website for your reference. Starting with income statement items for the first quarter, as Jim mentioned, net income attributable to limited partners for the first quarter 2020 was $1.4 billion or $0.61 per unit on a fully diluted basis. Net income for the first quarter included $187 million or $0.08 per unit benefit in deferred tax expense associated with the settlement of the liquidity option on March 5 in subsequent accounting for a related deferred tax liability. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $2 billion for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $1.2 billion for the first quarter of 2019. Excluding changes in working capital accounts, cash flow from operations for the first quarter of 2020 was 3% lower than the first quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2020, which we define as cash flow from operations minus investing activities plus any contributions from non-controlling interest, was $916 million. Free cash flow was $3.4 billion for the last 12 months ended March 2020, which was 78% higher than the $1.9 billion reported for the last 12 months ending March 2019. We define payout ratio as the sum of cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from operations. Our payout ratio was approximately 56% for the first quarter of 2020 cash flow from operations. In January, we provided guidance that we expected to increase our distribution related to the first quarter of 2020 by 0.25% to $0.4475 per unit. Given the economic sudden stop and uncertainty related to Coronavirus, we thought it was prudent to hold our distribution flat at $0.445. It will be paid on May 12. This distribution represents a 1.7% increase when compared to the same quarter of 2019. Given the current macroeconomic backdrop, it will be delivered and our Board will evaluate our distribution growth quarterly in 2020. With respect to buybacks, we purchased $140 million of common units during the first quarter of 2020, substantially all prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, which is 6.4 million unit reduction. Additionally EPD's distribution reinvestment plan and the employee unit purchase plan purchased a total of 1.4 million EPD units in the open market in the first quarter and affiliates of our general partner purchased approximately 1.5 million units in the open market during the first quarter of 2020. Now moving on capital expenditures. As Jim mentioned, we effectively reduced 2020 capital expenditures by $1.1 billion in our initial review. We now anticipate spending between $2.5 billion and $3 billion in growth capital projects this year. We currently expect growth capital investments for 2021 and 2022 to be approximately $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, based solely on sanctioned projects already approved. As Jim also mentioned, we are currently in negotiations on joint ventures, which could lead to a further reduction in growth capital expenditures for 2020, 2021 and 2022. We currently expect sustaining capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $300 million, which is a $100 million reduction from previous guidance. Total capital investments in the first quarter of 2020 were $1.1 billion, which includes $69 million of sustaining capital expenditures. Turning to capitalization. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, 2020. Assuming the first call date of our hybrids and as well as the final maturity date, the average life of our debt portfolio is 16.1 years and 20.2 years, respectively. Our average effective cost of debt is 4.5%. As mentioned on our last quarterly call, we completed our issuance of 10-year, 31-year and 40-year notes in January 2020. The aggregate amount of that issuance was $3 billion. We are very appreciative for the continued strong support from our term debt investors in this offering. Currently we do not expect to have the need to return to the debt capital markets in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12-months ended March 31, 2020 was $8.1 billion and our net consolidated leverage ratio was 3.3 times after adjusting debt for partial equity credit in the hybrid debt securities given by the rating agencies and further reduced for unrestricted cash. Our consolidated liability was approximately $7 billion at March 31, 2020, including availability under our existing credit facilities and approximately $2 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. As of today, our liquidity is approximately $8 billion with additional liquidity provided by the new 364-day facility entered into on April 3. We are grateful for the support and responsiveness of our bank group in providing us additional flexibility during this time. We anticipate elevated uses of working capital in the near term for contango opportunities. Regarding our cash balance, our only remaining debt maturity in 2020 is a $1 billion maturity of 5.2% notes due in September. I would like to thank our employees, many of who were challenged to work from home while maintaining their same level of productivity. I would like to thank them for their efforts not only in our business continuity but also in the comprehensive SOX testing at our accounting controls and processes that attest the earnings we announce today and the 10-Q that will be filed on May 8. I want to take a minute to speak to the durability of our business as we see it currently. Our top 200 customers represented 96% of 2019 revenues. 78% of the revenues from our top 200 customers were comprised of investment-grade customers or those backed by letter of credit. This is based on public debt ratings through April 23, 2020. So it takes into consideration three of our formally investment-grade customers that have become high-yield fallen angels in the past few weeks. Only 11% of the revenues from our top 200 customers represented independent E&P companies. Our earnings are typically 80% to 90% fee-based depending on the commodity price and spread environment. When we break down the fee-based areas, we compartmentalize those into three broad categories. The first, take-or-pay or minimum volume commitments, which comprise 45% to 55% of our fee-based earnings. Second, durable fee earnings which we think of as storage throughput and wholesale residential deliveries make up another 20% to 30%. Fee earnings with more volumetric exposures such as wellhead dedication and certain demand base volumes make up the balance. Even within our volumetric based earnings, we have a high degree of competence in a lot of the earnings capture given the many ways our commercial and operational teams have hustled to keep our assets full such as repurposing storage and pipeline assets. Finally, I would like to iterate our financial objectives as to defend and maintain our distribution, our strong balance sheet and our debt rate, maintain ample liquidity and continue to high grade and invest in projects underwritten by high credit quality customers, long term fee-based contracts and underpinned by solid long term fundamentals. Before I turn the call over to Randy, we would like to thank our long-term investors for their feedback, confidence and support through these volatile times. To all of you and your families, stay safe. Yes. Shneur, on the buyback target, the company bought back $140 million worth of units in the first quarter. And if we use last year's cash flow from operations as a guide, 2% of that number was about $130 million, $140 million. So, I think we have pretty much addressed that. I think for a long time, the way we return capital to investors is consistent distribution growth. And again this year, we added the additional component of doing the buybacks. But I think right now, there is just too much uncertainty at this point in time with this economic sudden stop and how long does the effects of this Coronavirus last on the broader economy and energy demand. So, I think we will take a look quarterly as the Board meets and see how the business performs. What did you say? Well, our folks Graham Bacon back in operations is focused on reducing OpEx and sustaining CapEx. And I think I don't know how to answer the fact that we are hyper focused on cost and we are hyper focused on CapEx. So, I don't have an answer to it other than that. Thank you. And Christine, our travel and entertainment expenses are down too. Yes. Tristan, pretty much it was a combination of things because we had some projects that the capital expenditures were deferred. So yes, some moved from 2020 into 2021. But we had some that were indefinitely deferred, so they dropped out of 2020 and 2021. So it was a little bit of a combination of both. Yes. Tristan, we are in a pretty unusual time right now. I would say, if we think about base level of opportunities, it seems like invariably, we have opportunities to come in and debottleneck the system or come in and reduce costs. And they can be $10 million, $25 million, $50 million to throw. And all of a sudden, in a whole year, it adds up to $250 million to $500 million. So we have those type opportunities. As we think of things right now on the horizon, we don't see a lot of opportunities facing from the upstream side of our customer base, but we could very well see some opportunities on the downstream side and on the demand pull side as well. So I think as you are thinking about it, probably something in the $1 billion, $1.5 billion opportunity from a growth CapEx is a good base level. Yes. I will be honest. Really that hasn't been our priority is to come in and evaluate MLP versus C-Corp here the last few weeks. It's really about executing on the business in these uncertain times and getting us positioned from a liquidity standpoint and to take advantage of funding some of these contango opportunities. I think you hit on some key things there. I mean, it seems like invariably you can have some investor turnover. I think MLPs had our fair share of it here over the last six weeks. But if I come in and I think you hit on a key point, I think everybody is going to pay more in income taxes including C-Corps going down the roads. We will see what happens there. Somebody has got to pay the tab for all these $1 trillion stimulus packages. But also I think frankly what surprised me was some of the volatility and the C-Corp names that we saw some of those names just plummet. But we have not gone into a deep dive or any kind of reevaluation. Yes. If you could repeat your question one more time, maybe just a little bit louder? Yes. Gabe, on the first part, I think any use of proceeds that we had, whether it would be incremental areas where we may see additional room to reduce CapEx in 2020 or if there was any proceeds from any JV opportunities, it would really just come in and go to delevering. At this point in time, again, any other return on capital, be it through distribution growth or be it through incremental buyback, really we need to get more visibility of what the macroeconomic backdrop looks like and what the demand for energy looks like before we make any other decisions on that. And Gabe, what was the second part of your question? Yes. And Gabe on that one, that's where Jim said, with these discussions, it's for assets across all four segments. Yes. I will let Jim or Brent hit the timing of the earnings. I think the one benefit from low commodity prices is it doesn't take a lot of working capital to execute on contango. Yes. As far as the distribution growth question goes, we have been public since 1998 and we have provided distribution growth in every year since our IPO. So that's been one of our objectives over time is to provide consistent distribution growth. And so that's been important, it was over time. But you may have asked the question a different way, I am probably going to go back to the same answer. Given the uncertainty, again, this economic sudden stop that we have had on a global basis, it's historic. And just there is a lot of uncertainty of how the next three months, six months are going to progress. And I think we just need to have more visibility of how that's going to progress before we make any decisions about returning any additional capital above what we are doing now to investors at this point. I think this is a point where you really come in and protect your balance sheet, protect your debt rating, come in and protect your liquidity. And we have got a lot of good opportunities that our assets set us up for. And right now we are in execution mode big time over the next three, six, nine months."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Brent Secrest",
            "content": "No. I think you hit it. I mean on the flow side, we will have a record month for LPGs in April. We will have close to record in May, maybe a little bit less than April. And as we go out further, you could see some effects on production declines. But in the end, our dock space is over 90% contracted for LPGs and crude oil for take-or-pay. So, we haven't seen big drop-offs yet. I think maybe on the G&P side, we will see some volume decline on that side. But in terms of the customers that we deal with, if you look at the barrels that are going to be cut out, the barrel that's the highest cost to produce will be first. The second barrel that will probably get cut out is that the highest cost to get to market. And then the third will be some sort of a quality issue. So, if you look at our system and our customer base, I think we are, I don't want to say we will be the last ones to see reduction in volume, but I think they are pretty well positioned in terms of our customer base to keep on producing it at some sort of level. Christine, this is Brent Secrest. So, on a high level for LPGs, the contracts and as you go out further in time, this percentage goes down slightly. But on the LPGs side, over 90% are take-or-pay. If for some reason, the vessel doesn't show up, there is a payment that's made to Enterprise that is essentially an offset to what it would be for us to operate and recover our variable costs. So, there is kind of a fixed reservation. There is a reservation component and then there is a -- if they do show up with the vessel, there is a variable component that offsets our variable costs, and that varies contract-by-contract and term-by-term. On the crude side, again the volume is over 90%. The duration on our crude contracts is actually longer than the LPG side and that component is take-or-pay, and there is no sort of offset. It is take-or-pay whether the vessel shows up or does not show up, the fee is essentially the same. On the ethylene side, I am looking at Chris D'Anna next to me. All those, I think it's almost on 100%, 90% to 100%, Chris, that are being contracted as take-or-pay? When it comes to exports, I would let Jim or Randy correct me, but from a variability to our earnings as it relates to exports, it's essentially what you are talking about as some sort of, call it, walk up opportunity we would have on volume. It's pretty much set in stone. Yes. I mean that's fairly sensitive in my opinion. So in terms how we are going to contract this stuff, there is a chance for us to have some opportunities long term with people that it's probably not going to be a different approach than how we did some of our crude oil pipelines as there is some short term opportunity and if it made sense for us and it made sense for the customer, we did long term deals on the pipeline side of the Permian. So what may have not looked so great early on, looks pretty good now in the case of storage. It's a balance, frankly, of us trying to secure long term deals and then take advantage of the opportunity. But in terms of specific numbers, I will just echo Jim. You take hard look to your business and you get a lot of people involved and you find things that frankly you forgot about. And we have been pleasantly surprised with how much crude oil storage that we have access to. And T.J., I think one other thing that we talk, it was just three months ago, feels like it's three years ago when we had our fourth quarter earnings call. We talked about in 2019, we had what we would call outsized spread capture in 2019 that we thought it maybe $500 million to $600 million of that would not repeat in 2020. We have the potential to come in and have that kind of number again in 2020. Yes, I mean if you look at first quarter, we are on pace to track the same numbers as second quarter. But you know, if there is this is pace to be made and I understand it that production declines, then by default, I would say that crude exports are going to decline. I just think a lot of this crude exports are walk-up opportunities for other terminals. I would think that if people have take-or-pay contracts with us, I don't think you will see a big impact on volumes on our side and certainly not going to see a big impact on dollars on our side. In the case of trying to reconvert crude LPG, I think that sounds much simpler than it is. I mean it's essentially a dock is what you gain. And if crude oil production declines, you are going to make the assumption that NGL production will go with it. Now you may see different basins that return that aren't crude-centric. So I would think along those lines. There may be a resurgence in some of those basins that maybe value or have NGLs and gas. So I think there's some opportunity there for us. Yes. Certain commodities we have targeted closer to the front. And other commodities, frankly, we have kind of spread it out based on liquidity and some other things. But I think for the balance of the year, you are going to see these numbers show up month-by-month. Yes. This is Brent Secrest. That basically came about because you guys saw what was going on in the market and there was a flight to storage. And that was the open access storage and frankly that was where people were buying crude oil, whether that was financially or what have you. We look at our customer base and our Permian producers and our Eagle Ford producers ultimately wanted access to market. And some of them approached us to figure out if that could still be reversed. Graham Bacon and his team figured it out how to do it very cost efficiently and quickly. There was a lot of things still in place. So that was the thought behind that. And it just led to another optimization opportunity on our side and also a solution for our customers. It's mainly things that are geographically advantaged. I would say the one big area of uptick that we saw was India and Indonesia. But certainly, India had an increase on what they were bringing in. I would say Delaware Basin light. You saw with differentials did out there. That became challenged for a little while. Eagle Ford condensate as certain buyers stepped away from the market. And then frankly, I see some opportunities that are going to offset that. And whether that's the Rockies or potentially Haynesville, some of those areas I think are going to have a resurgence."

At this time all participants are on a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Randy Burkhalter, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, DeWanda. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss fourth quarter and year-end 2021 earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise\u2019s general partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance today. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the Company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise\u2019s management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. And so, with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim now.\nJim Teague: Thank you, Randy. We reported net income attributable to common unitholders for 2021 of $4.6 billion or $2.10 per unit compared to $3.8 billion or $1.71 per unit on a fully diluted basis for 2020. Cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion for \u201821 compared to $5.9 billion for 2020. Both \u201821 and \u201820 were impacted by large changes in the working capital and opposite directions brought about by significant storage opportunities. We generated $6.6 billion of DCF in \u201821 compared to $6.4 million in 2020. We had 1.7 times coverage. We retained $2.6 billion of DCF in \u201821 and head into \u201822 with significant financial flexibility. We also increased our distribution again in 2021 to $1.815 per common unit, making this the 23rd consecutive year of distribution growth since our IPO in 1998. In addition, 2021 marked another year of records for enterprise, including 12 financial records and five operating records. Our NGL Pipelines & Services and Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segments set gross operating margin records. We\u2019ve also been focused on growing our Petrochemicals & Refined Products Services segment, which had a record gross operating margin of $1.4 billion for 2021 with a huge contribution in petrochemicals, where gross operating margin exceeded $1 billion for 2021. We set five operational performance records in \u201821, including record ethane marine volumes, record natural gas transportation volumes, record refined products and petrochemical transportation volumes, record propylene production volumes and record -- propylene production volumes. We also finished 2021 with a solid fourth quarter, reporting total gross operating margin of $2.1 billion. Our quarterly results were driven by another strong quarter from petrochemicals, our natural gas processing margins, an increase in equity NGL production, the continuing recovery in crude oil pipeline volumes to near pre-COVID levels and record natural gas pipeline volumes. As to CapEx, our growth capital spending in 2021 was $1.8 billion with approximately $2.2 billion of major projects currently under construction. The largest projects put into service in 2021 include a C5 hydrotreater at Mont Belvieu, and we added pipeline capacity to move ethane from Mont Belvieu to Beaumont, another project to provide feedstocks to the growing Gulf Coast petrochemicals. In our Natural Gas Services group, our Gillis Lateral and Acadian Haynesville expansion were put into service in December of \u201821. These projects move growing volumes from Haynesville down to the LNG quarter in South Louisiana. In our Petrochemicals segment, we completed our ethylene export terminal and ethylene storage and pipelines. Our sector PDH remains on budget and on schedule for in-service in the first half of 2023. Our project team has done an outstanding job to ensure supply chain issues would not impact project schedule. And Graham and his team are happy to report that almost all major equipment is now on site, significantly derisking any major equipment issues. We were also excited to announce the agreement to acquire Navitas Midstream. Navitas gives us an attractive entry point for our natural gas processing and NGL businesses in the Midland Basin. We anticipate closing this acquisition in the first quarter of 2022, subject to customary regulatory approvals. Navitas plans for the construction of another natural gas processing plant, which would also provide us additional organic growth. Last year, we have announced that we joined forces with Magellan and ICE to promote a U.S. Gulf Coast futures crude oil contract. Early indications are that the contract is going to be well received as ICE announced last week that the contract traded well over 1 million barrels a day in just the first few days of trading. We\u2019re excited about what this contract means, not just for the U.S. producer but for the global oil industry. We learned the hard way in April of 2020 that the perils that come with a futures contract that doesn\u2019t have adequate physical infrastructure, the ICE Midland WTI AGC futures contract has access to 14 ship docks in the Houston area, providing significant direct access for exports. In addition, Enterprise and Magellan\u2019s combined distribution systems offer access to approximately 150 million barrels of total crude oil storage capacity and 4.5 million barrels of refining capacity. As we finish up \u201821 and move into \u201822, I\u2019d also like to highlight the momentum from our evolutionary technology team. This team led by Angie Murray and from a commercial perspective, Carrie Weaver is home to bright and creative people. We have a number of initiatives underway with major players in each segment of the energy value chain. In addition to working on lower carbon opportunities in the areas like hydrogen, carbon sequestration, circular plastics and renewable fuels, this team and our big data group constantly have a number of important projects underway using the billions of pieces of data that Enterprise has in order to improve the reliability of our systems and optimize these systems every day. For enterprise, in addition to supplying the developing world with the cleaner fuels it needs today, these teams are on a path to developing lower carbon projects that both complement our systems and are profitable. We would not have thrown the amount of horsepower into these initiatives if we didn\u2019t believe in their potential and profitability for our company. We had our best year ever for safety in 2021. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that our employees truly care about one another and the communities where we operate. As we said in the press release, we are extremely proud and grateful for the teamwork and contribution of our 7,000 employees to Enterprise\u2019s financial, operating and safety performance in 2021. Over the last two years, COVID-19 has whipsawed the global economy, including the U.S. energy sector. As always is the case, our people responded. In 2021, it was their efforts that enabled 3 of our 4 business segments to report record earnings that resulted in our company posting record gross operating margin, cash flow from operations and free cash flow. Regardless of the situation, whether it\u2019s a freeze that shuts down the entire state, the world went into a dark hole caused by a global pandemic are the complete opposite in 2021 when demand and prices for our products and services soared, our people proved to be creative and determined. We want to thank each and every one of them for yet another outstanding performance in 2021. Today, Randy and I are largely going to focus on \u201821 results, and you\u2019ll probably have a lot of questions about 2022. But before we get to Randy, I\u2019ll finish with our thoughts on the changing sentiments around oil and gas. For some time now, the sentiment towards all traditional forms of energy, especially in political circles has been very negative. Many said that the world should pull the plug on traditional energy as soon as possible and completely devote our capital and efforts toward renewable energy. Without a doubt, this was always na\u00efve. The world now realizes that an overnight transition to renewable sources of energy is not at all possible as evidenced by the rapid development of various global crises, including high natural gas and LNG prices, high crude oil prices not seen since 2014 and runaway inflation not seen for about 40 years. Europe is starved for gas and is faced with heat or eat, while Russia with its major oil and gas supplier is amassing troops on the Ukraine border. Try as you may, it\u2019s hard to blame these crises on the pandemic. Over one-third of the world lives in energy poverty, mainly in developing countries. Europe\u2019s energy policies have now made energy poverty a reality in first world countries. As an oil analyst said, energy is the economy. We, in the United States, live in a country of plenty. We are origination with the high quality of life of creative culture, now also blessed with abundant energy. Maybe that has distorted our thinking about the situation in other countries or regions. People who don\u2019t want developing nations to have what we have are either in denial, hypocrites or both. At Enterprise, we\u2019ve been outspoken that is going to take all of the above, not for a few years, but for decades to come. Look to comments made by a variety of sources, everyone from the IEA to the Head of Saudi Aramco, members of the European Union and even the U.S. Energy Secretary. Ultimately, they all message the same thing: Investment in oil and gas needs to ramp up sharply in order to provide the badly needed baseload traditional sources of energy that will be needed alongside low-carbon fuels and green energy to meet the world\u2019s growing demand. At Enterprise, we\u2019ve never seen supplying energy to meet growing needs as two competing paths. We\u2019re going to remain focused on supplying the world with a clean, low-cost and reliable fuels it needs today, while also playing a role and important part in developing lower carbon alternatives. I think I\u2019ve said enough. Randy, I\u2019ll let you.\nRandy Fowler: All right. Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Starting with the fourth quarter income statement items. Net income attributable to common unitholders for the fourth quarter was $1 billion or $0.47 per unit on a fully diluted basis compared to $337 million or $0.15 per common unit on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter of last year. Net income was reduced by noncash asset impairment charges of $120 million or $0.05 per unit in the fourth quarter of 2021. This compares to $800 million or $0.36 per common unit for asset impairment charges of fourth quarter 2020. So, before the impairment charges, EPU was $0.52 per unit for 2021 compared to $0.51 per unit for 2020. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter 2020. On a full year basis, cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion and $5.9 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash flow from operations benefited from approximately $1.4 billion of net cash provided by changes in working capital accounts in 2021. By comparison, cash flow from operations was reduced by $768 million in 2020 due to changes in working capital. So if you would, a swing of $2.2 billion between the two years. Again, doing the math, cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $7.1 billion for 2021 compared to $6.7 billion in 2020. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $6.3 billion compared to $2.7 billion for 2020. Before cash provided by changes in working capital, free cash flow was $4.9 billion in 2021 compared to $3.4 billion in 2020. We declared a distribution of $0.465 per common unit with regard to the fourth quarter of 2021, which represents a 3.3% increase compared to the distribution that we declared for the fourth quarter of 2020. This distribution will be paid February 11th to all common unitholders of record as of the close of business, January 31st. During the fourth quarter, we also repurchased approximately $125 million or 5.8 million common units. This brought our repurchases under our buyback program to $200 million or 9.2 million common units for 2021. As of year-end 2021, we have utilized 24% of our outstanding $2 billion buyback program, which was authorized in 2019. In addition to these buybacks, Enterprise\u2019s distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined $37 million of EPD common units in the open market during the fourth quarter of \u201821 and $144 million for the full year. Our payout ratio, which we define as the sum of our cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from operations before working capital changes was 58% for 2021. The payout, the return of capital to investors includes $4 billion of declared distributions and $200 million of common unit buybacks. Our 2021 payout ratio as a percent of free cash flow before cash provided by changes in working capital was 84%. As we previously discussed, our capital allocation strategy remains focused on an all-the-above approach, investing in quality midstream infrastructure with attractive returns, supporting and growing distributions, executing buybacks opportunistically, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. In terms of capital investments in the fourth quarter, total capital investments were $424 million, which included $325 million of growth CapEx and $99 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Total capital investments in 2021 were $2.2 billion, which included investments in growth capital projects of $1.8 billion and $430 million for sustaining CapEx. For 2022, we estimate growth capital investments to be approximately $1.5 billion. This estimate does not include capital investments associated with the partnership\u2019s proposed Seaport Oil Terminal, SPOT, which remains subject to governmental approval. We currently expect sustaining capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $350 million. We currently expect the acquisition of Navitas to close in the first quarter of 2022 and our estimate of $1.5 billion in growth CapEx in 2022 includes any Navitas related CapEx in the year. Our total debt principal outstanding was $29.8 billion as of December 31, 2021. Assuming the first call date or final maturity date of our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio was 16.5 years and 20.7 years, respectively. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.4%. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $7.3 billion at December 31, 2021, including availability under our bank credit facilities and approximately $2.8 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. This amount of cash on hand, while elevated by historical standards, was reduced this morning as we retired $750 million of senior notes that matured and we will retire an additional $650 million of senior notes on February 15th. Further, as we previously communicated, we expect to fund our acquisition of Navitas with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the partnership\u2019s existing commercial paper facility and bank credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $2.1 billion and $8.4 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021. Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.1 times after adjusting debt for the partial equity trade of hybrid securities by the rating agencies and also being reduced by the partnership\u2019s unrestricted cash on. With that, Randy, we can open it up for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter:\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering.\nColton Bean: Good morning. So, now that you have the updated capital budget in hand, can you update us on how you\u2019re evaluating your payout ratio for 2022? I think based on the budget today, it seems like the increase in free cash should outpace the distribution rates, but hoping to understand if Navitas funding would steer you to lower payout.\nRandy Fowler: Colton, this is Randy. We\u2019ve -- our payout ratio has really been averaging between 56% and 62% of cash flow from operations before working capital changes. And I think we\u2019ll most likely be in that range in 2022.\nColton Bean: Okay. And so, the Navitas acquisition, does that factor into the thinking?\nRandy Fowler: Well, I mean, it is an allocation of capital for $3.25 billion that we\u2019ll pay for. So, some of our -- as we mentioned, we\u2019ll have some cash on hand after we\u2019ve come in and pay this debt maturities in February. So, some of the cash would go towards the purchase price as well as borrowings on our bank credit facility.\nColton Bean: And then just on the operational front, a significant step-up in frac unit margins relative to recent history. Can you expand a bit on what you\u2019re seeing in that market and the sustainability of those margins in \u201822?\nZach Strait: This is Zach. Some of that is a little bit of commodity exposure as the fracs have. So, there\u2019s some blending margins. Some of that on the revenue side, we have a variable cost component. And so as gas prices go higher, you\u2019re seeing our revenue go up, but our expenses are also going up.\nColton Bean: Okay. And in terms of the operating expenses that -- it seems like that would have been backed out of the unit margins or the operating margin, but I just want to clarify that.\nZach Strait: Yes. It should be. So, a lot of what you\u2019re seeing on the increase is the commodity exposure on the blending margins. As far as frac margins as a fee base, there hasn\u2019t been a significant change there, nor do we sort of see one in the near future.\nColton Bean: But as gas prices go up, your frac fee goes up?\nZach Strait: Correct. As gas prices go up, our fees go up, offset by some higher operational expenses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: So, quick question. I guess, there\u2019s growing concern when you think about the Permian and potential bottlenecks on the natural gas side as we kind of go through 2023. And so, I\u2019d kind of be curious on some of your thoughts around this topic and kind of how this bottleneck potentially gets resolved. I mean, we\u2019ve got, obviously, private E&Ps driving the majority of the growth, which makes it a little bit more difficult to sanction large greenfield projects just given that everybody is going to want 10-year take-or-pay contracts. And the private E&Ps may not be willing to kind of give that because they just don\u2019t have 10 years of drilling inventory. So just kind of curious, your thoughts on kind of how you think this ultimately gets resolved.\nJim Teague: You want to take it, Brent, or do you want me to?\nBrent Secrest: Yes. This is Brent Secrest. It feels like a lot of the majors and the bigger publics out there are fairly well set in terms of the gas takeaway capacity. Most of the customers that we deal with and you can see our customer list, they seem like they\u2019re in pretty good shape. So, when it comes to basis, in the past, the private guys have probably been the last ones to step up for capacity. And it\u2019s benefited them in this environment from a crude perspective, from a gas perspective and some other things that they have had to and there was other people that stepped up to get projects done and to remove those type of basis dislocations. Ultimately, somebody is going to need to step up or a collection of people are going to need to step up. And every month that goes by without a gas pipeline being announced is just going to add to the problem. But there are certainly opportunities for us as Enterprise in terms of the capacity that we have remained open to participate in these types of dislocations. We talk to our customers about a potential for a pipeline project, but right now, we haven\u2019t been able to get anything done on that side.\nChase Mulvehill: So, can I just follow up on this a bit and ask? I mean it seems like obviously somebody is going to have to take more risk, whether it\u2019s the private E&P and whether it\u2019s the person going to build the pipe and do not 10 years or 5 years or they\u2019re probably not going to do, or is it going to be the gas processor. Like obviously, now you\u2019re going to be the largest gas processor in the Permian. So, let me ask you the question. Are you willing to take more risk in the Permian on the gas processing side and maybe the contracts may have to be signed by the gas processor versus kind of the private E&P?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. That\u2019s just something in the past, we haven\u2019t done Chase and it\u2019s hard. I mean, there\u2019s times where we step up for some last bit of remaining capacity that we can overperform from an operation standpoint, and we\u2019ll take on a minute amount of risk. But ultimately the folks that are realizing $85 a barrel and the folks that are realizing gas prices at these levels and NGL prices at these levels, and terms of how we go pitch projects, those are the ones, that probably need to step up. Can we be complementary to it? Possibly, but to me, ultimately, this is about producers stepping up to get this project done.\nChase Mulvehill : Okay, perfect. Quick follow-up on ethane exports. During the quarter you averaged 171,000 barrels a day, and I think your dock capacity is 240,000 barrels a day. So, I don\u2019t know if Justin\u2019s there. I don\u2019t know if somebody can kind of comment on where do you think you can take this, do you take it to the 240,000 barrels a day, or are there actually some constraints with vessels or imports on the other side, these docs that would present some constraints.\nJustin Kleiderer: Hey, Chase. I think that as we think about dock capacity or ethane export capacity, we think 200 a day, maybe slightly above is a going run rate. But more often than not, when we start approaching those levels, those things that are outside of our system that start becoming constraints primarily around freight. So, it\u2019s a milk run business and freight has to be there on a consistent basis for the units to be able to run at those rates. And more often than not, we don\u2019t see that. Over time, we expect that market to get more mature for us to be able to get closer to the sustainable rates of 200, maybe slightly above.\nJim Teague: So 240 is really your instantaneous, 200 is basically your operating.\nJustin Kleiderer: That\u2019s right.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTristan Richardson: Hey. Good morning, guys. I appreciate your comments on Navitas and the opportunity in the Midland. I mean, should we think of that asset base as running pretty full today, and that\u2019s driving the new plant investment? And then, should we think of a development schedule as planned activity by existing customers or maybe recent commercial wins with new customers?\nRandy Fowler: We think that we -- I think everybody knows they\u2019re bringing a new plan on as we speak. We understand they have plans for an additional plan. Frankly, I don\u2019t think we know whether it\u2019s what their existing customers or what their plans are. So, we haven\u2019t dug in too deep going through this regulatory process.\nTristan Richardson: Understood. And then just on the LPG side, you\u2019ve talked about -- obviously, we saw substantial growth in total U.S. exports as part of the overall kind of global recovery. But recently, you guys have also noted that there\u2019s a competing incremental domestic poll that\u2019s emerged that may create one-off opportunities here or there to keep molecule safe side. But, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing sort of as we start the year? And how 2022 unfolds on that dynamic?\nJim Teague: I\u2019ll start it out and then take it from there. When we see increases on the domestic side, those are weather-related. At the end of the day, Tristan, the market for the incremental NGLs from the United States, which are substantial, is going to be at the dock. There\u2019s just no doubt about it. And unless Justin feels otherwise, we\u2019re going to say they\u2019re largely pointed towards Asia. Am I missing something?\nJustin Kleiderer: No. That\u2019s it. Everything is going balance at the dock.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury: This one is probably for Brent. Your NGL Pipeline segment was down $200 million in 2021 versus 2020. And you gave some helpful color in the release that Permian and Rockies pipes had pipeline or less. I guess, my question is what inning are we in, in terms of these NGL contract roll-offs? Obviously, a ton of Permian processing plants kind of came out in the last five or six years. So should we think of more contract rolls could still be to come?\nBrent Secrest: So, I think this is the first full quarter that we\u2019ve seen the Rocky Mountain contract roll-off in effect. On the Permian side, there\u2019s some incentive rates that are in place. So, those are there to stay for a while. And then, if you look at across the MAPL system, the fact of the matter is in the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t really get much of a winter. So, from a propane demand perspective, quarter -- fourth quarter to fourth quarter, we saw some effects of that. We\u2019re seeing a good January and a good start to the year, but there were some -- definitely some effects to propane lack of demand domestically.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then as my follow-up, this one might be for Tony. What is your latest projection of when Permian NGL production will warrant enterprise, either building more NGL takeaway or possibly switching Seminole [ph] back to NGLs?\nAnthony Chovanec: It\u2019s certainly...\nJim Teague: Go ahead, Tony.\nAnthony Chovanec: Yes. Well, I\u2019ll tell you what, Teague, do you want to take it?\nJean Ann Salisbury: Sorry, Tony, I didn\u2019t mean to cut you out.\nJim Teague: Yes. I mean, if you look at our system, we have a lot of options, and you mentioned that we can repurpose certain assets, but call it, late 2024, we\u2019ll be assessing whether we can do some brownfield expansions or evaluated greenfield project. Jean Ann, I want to make the assumption that it\u2019s -- M2E2 is the one that gets repurposed. I mean, there\u2019s some other better cost alternatives than potentially that one.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Just one follow-up on the last set of questions on the MAPL contract rolling off. Just wanted to clarify, was that renewed at a lower rate, or is it just not renewed in its operating more on a spot basis?\nRandy Fowler: I believe so, and correct me on this. But, Michael, those were not renewed. Those contracts were to support the expansion from a number of years ago. And there\u2019s those volumes are still flowing on this. They\u2019re just kind of rolling at the tariff rate -- I\u2019m sorry, there is deficiency revenue we are recognizing that we were no longer recognizing.\nMichael Blum: And second question, I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit of insight into your current conversations with producers. Are you seeing any change in their approach, any willingness to add more rigs, or is it pretty much status quo in terms of the real discipline you\u2019re seeing certainly from the publics?\nJim Teague: Go ahead, Tony.\nAnthony Chovanec: Obviously, the publics remain very committed to discipline. That said, if you look at what Chevron has said in the last couple of days, you look at what Exxon said this morning, the Permian is their hot basin and they\u2019re both going to increase activity there for 2022 and beyond. The other thing that\u2019s very hard to get your arms around is there\u2019s a lot of acreage, and I hate to just use that term generically that\u2019s changing hands and what I would call is Tier 2 acreage. And that will be drilled. The private equities are picking it up and the privates are picking it up. So, that\u2019s how we see it. We see rig counts, completions continuing to be added, and it\u2019s very profitable. As Brent talked about, the gas takeaway situation has to be resolved. But we\u2019ve been really, really outspoken about a large number. People thought it was very large, 1.8 million barrels for \u201821, \u201822 and \u201823, that\u2019s crude oil production. And you can think about somewhere between 800,000 and 900,000 barrels of NGLs associated with that. And if you look at the crude oil number that the EIA published in December, we\u2019re talking 600,000 barrels of increase in 2021. So, it\u2019s not a stretch to say that that $1.8 million is probably a little on the low side, as is the liquids number. Did that answer your question, Michael?\nMichael Blum: Yes. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.\nSpiro Dounis: First question is just on spread opportunities heading into the year. I know in the past, you talked about anywhere between $500 million to $800 million in spread opportunities in any given year. So, curious on two fronts. One, do you have a sense of what that number ended up being in 2021? And as you look out into 2022, does it seem like this could be an environment to improve upon that number?\nJim Teague: Last year? \u201821 is between $800 million and $1 billion. And I\u2019d say, 2022 is probably going to be between $500 million and $800 million.\nSpiro Dounis: Back to the average. Got it. That makes sense. Thanks, Jim. Second one, just -- I know you\u2019re going through the Navitas process now, so you probably can\u2019t say much, but would just love to get your general thoughts on M&A in general. Just curious if there are other assets out there that check a lot of those same boxes as Navitas, and then just to get your overall appetite to do more tuck-in transactions that fit nicely into the EPD system.\nJim Teague: I think I love Randy\u2019s -- what Randy says. Price matters and it has to fit our value chain. So, I don\u2019t think -- you never say never, but it\u2019s got to meet some criteria. If you look at anything that Enterprise has ever done in terms of acquisitions, invariably, it brings something to the total value chain. And that\u2019s a criteria we\u2019re not going to breach.\nRandy Fowler: And Spiro, this is Randy. I\u2019d just add, Navitas is special because not only did it broaden our natural gas business into the Midland Basin where we didn\u2019t have anything, it also broadened relationships with customers that we already had. And as Jim said, it\u2019s complementary to our system. And again, the other thing is the cash accretion on the deal was superior to any assumption on buybacks. And also, no matter where we assume synergy capture, or even if we don\u2019t capture $1 of synergies, this was superior doing a leverage parity buyback. So, very excited about the Navitas deal. And again, it\u2019s a special transaction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: I wanted to start on CapEx. So, the $1.5 billion spend for this year, that\u2019s obviously consistent with the $1 billion to $1.5 billion you said that you thought you\u2019d get to. But it\u2019s up from $800 million, I guess, committed spend that you had talked to last time. So, can you talk to specific projects that were added? And then on the major capital project slide, it looks like it\u2019s about $2.2 billion for \u201822 and beyond, was $2 billion previously. Just is that apples-to-apples, or how can I think about kind of comparing those two data points?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Hi, Keith. Good morning. Yes, we were -- what we were finding is when we were coming in and just talking about sanctioned projects only, it was tending to I guess it was understating really where we thought our CapEx would be. And I think Jim\u2019s highlighted that we are working on a number of projects. And we came out this year and said, look, rather than coming in and trying to do surgery on what\u2019s sanctioned and what\u2019s not sanctioned that we\u2019re working on, the $1.5 billion is just where we think we\u2019re going to wind up for the year. And those are the sanctioned projects that we\u2019ve been talking about that are included on that sheet that you saw in our supplemental slides that we posted this morning. And it was also some -- it also included these projects under development as well. The difference between the $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, I think there are some small things that we\u2019re doing from a natural gas gathering standpoint over the next two, three years that aggregated enough, it rounded to another $100 million. So, if you would have made that schedule.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. Got it. That makes sense. A separate question just on Navitas. Do you have any -- can you give us a sense just of how much of the, I guess, revenue or DCF you\u2019re thinking for 2023 is tied to commodity prices? Is it similar to your existing processing business in terms of fee floors, or is there more or less commodity exposure in this business versus your existing business?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. And I\u2019ll take a shot at this and Jim and Brent may want to come in and add some color. I think the way we look at it, just when we think about our equity NGL production, we\u2019re probably adding probably an incremental 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day of liquids exposure as a result of the Navitas deal.\nJim Teague: The way we look at what we see over the next few years, commodity exposure isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing for us. I think we\u2019ve -- Chris, we -- I think you said we had 18% commodity exposure last year? Was that your number? Where I saw that number -- but it\u2019s not -- my point is, in this environment, a little more commodity exposure is not a bad thing.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. And what Jim is highlighting is actually on page 9 of our supplemental slide deck. If you look over the last few years and really put that on the other side, when we come in and think about our fee-based earnings, they\u2019ve ranged from 82% to 87% over the last three years. In 2021, it was 82%. So, spread related and commodity based was the 18%. And coming in and what we\u2019ve said in the past, we really don\u2019t mind a lower fee because that just means our commodity businesses are doing better. And again, just expanding on what Jim said, in this world where there -- and again, we think some of this is turning, but where there is an underinvestment in oil and gas globally, we just think from a structure standpoint, commodity prices will hold up well, and we just want more exposure to it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle May with Capital One Securities.\nKyle May: Just one question for me today. You mentioned the Haynesville as an area that could drive growth this year. Can you talk more about what you\u2019re seeing in that area? And what kind of growth you expect this year?\nJim Teague: Where is Natalie? Do you want to answer it? You can take the mask off to answer it.\nNatalie Gayden: We\u2019re seeing growth. In fact, well, one of the things we\u2019re doing right now is bringing [indiscernible] back up because Cotton Valley is being drilled. So, we\u2019re bringing that processing plant back up. But as far as lean gas, our systems are starting to fill and our vision is that we\u2019re going to have to probably go through some expansions as far as treating goes. So, all good things, all we\u2019re seeing is increases in production.\nRandy Fowler: Okay. DeWanda, this is Randy. We have time for one more question before we terminate the call.\nOperator: All right. Our final question comes from the line of Yves Siegel with Siegel Asset.\nYves Siegel: Just a quick question. How do you think about the Northeast natural gas and NGLs, given problems with takeaway capacity?\nAnthony Chovanec: Yves, this is Tony. We\u2019ve always felt that that area was challenged. The rock, the resource is tremendous, both for dry gas and for NGL rich. The resource is incredible. But getting it out and getting it to market remains a challenge. And so, I think, you see the producers in the capital markets calibrating in that way. The question, just -- so I wondered three or four years ago, where is the incremental gas going to come from? Is it going to come from Appalachia or Haynesville? Well, it\u2019s clear now that it\u2019s going to come from the Haynesville. 50 rigs, 20 frac crews working. And as Natalie mentioned, Cotton Valley, we see the Haynesville on the marginal gas molecule as being the provider outside of oil-related gas.\nJim Teague: Did that answer your question, sir?\nYves Siegel: Really well. Yes. Thank you. That\u2019s it for me.\nJim Teague: Okay. DeWanda, before you give the replay information, we\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today for our call. And the Company is going to sign off now, and if you would go ahead and give the replay information to our listeners. Thank you. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "content": "Hey, Chase. I think that as we think about dock capacity or ethane export capacity, we think 200 a day, maybe slightly above is a going run rate. But more often than not, when we start approaching those levels, those things that are outside of our system that start becoming constraints primarily around freight. So, it's a milk run business and freight has to be there on a consistent basis for the units to be able to run at those rates. And more often than not, we don't see that. Over time, we expect that market to get more mature for us to be able to get closer to the sustainable rates of 200, maybe slightly above. That's right. No. That's it. Everything is going balance at the dock."

            "content": "Thank you, Randy. We reported net income attributable to common unitholders for 2021 of $4.6 billion or $2.10 per unit compared to $3.8 billion or $1.71 per unit on a fully diluted basis for 2020. Cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion for \u201821 compared to $5.9 billion for 2020. Both \u201821 and \u201820 were impacted by large changes in the working capital and opposite directions brought about by significant storage opportunities. We generated $6.6 billion of DCF in \u201821 compared to $6.4 million in 2020. We had 1.7 times coverage. We retained $2.6 billion of DCF in \u201821 and head into \u201822 with significant financial flexibility. We also increased our distribution again in 2021 to $1.815 per common unit, making this the 23rd consecutive year of distribution growth since our IPO in 1998. In addition, 2021 marked another year of records for enterprise, including 12 financial records and five operating records. Our NGL Pipelines & Services and Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segments set gross operating margin records. We've also been focused on growing our Petrochemicals & Refined Products Services segment, which had a record gross operating margin of $1.4 billion for 2021 with a huge contribution in petrochemicals, where gross operating margin exceeded $1 billion for 2021. We set five operational performance records in \u201821, including record ethane marine volumes, record natural gas transportation volumes, record refined products and petrochemical transportation volumes, record propylene production volumes and record -- propylene production volumes. We also finished 2021 with a solid fourth quarter, reporting total gross operating margin of $2.1 billion. Our quarterly results were driven by another strong quarter from petrochemicals, our natural gas processing margins, an increase in equity NGL production, the continuing recovery in crude oil pipeline volumes to near pre-COVID levels and record natural gas pipeline volumes. As to CapEx, our growth capital spending in 2021 was $1.8 billion with approximately $2.2 billion of major projects currently under construction. The largest projects put into service in 2021 include a C5 hydrotreater at Mont Belvieu, and we added pipeline capacity to move ethane from Mont Belvieu to Beaumont, another project to provide feedstocks to the growing Gulf Coast petrochemicals. In our Natural Gas Services group, our Gillis Lateral and Acadian Haynesville expansion were put into service in December of \u201821. These projects move growing volumes from Haynesville down to the LNG quarter in South Louisiana. In our Petrochemicals segment, we completed our ethylene export terminal and ethylene storage and pipelines. Our sector PDH remains on budget and on schedule for in-service in the first half of 2023. Our project team has done an outstanding job to ensure supply chain issues would not impact project schedule. And Graham and his team are happy to report that almost all major equipment is now on site, significantly derisking any major equipment issues. We were also excited to announce the agreement to acquire Navitas Midstream. Navitas gives us an attractive entry point for our natural gas processing and NGL businesses in the Midland Basin. We anticipate closing this acquisition in the first quarter of 2022, subject to customary regulatory approvals. Navitas plans for the construction of another natural gas processing plant, which would also provide us additional organic growth. Last year, we have announced that we joined forces with Magellan and ICE to promote a U.S. Gulf Coast futures crude oil contract. Early indications are that the contract is going to be well received as ICE announced last week that the contract traded well over 1 million barrels a day in just the first few days of trading. We're excited about what this contract means, not just for the U.S. producer but for the global oil industry. We learned the hard way in April of 2020 that the perils that come with a futures contract that doesn't have adequate physical infrastructure, the ICE Midland WTI AGC futures contract has access to 14 ship docks in the Houston area, providing significant direct access for exports. In addition, Enterprise and Magellan's combined distribution systems offer access to approximately 150 million barrels of total crude oil storage capacity and 4.5 million barrels of refining capacity. As we finish up \u201821 and move into \u201822, I'd also like to highlight the momentum from our evolutionary technology team. This team led by Angie Murray and from a commercial perspective, Carrie Weaver is home to bright and creative people. We have a number of initiatives underway with major players in each segment of the energy value chain. In addition to working on lower carbon opportunities in the areas like hydrogen, carbon sequestration, circular plastics and renewable fuels, this team and our big data group constantly have a number of important projects underway using the billions of pieces of data that Enterprise has in order to improve the reliability of our systems and optimize these systems every day. For enterprise, in addition to supplying the developing world with the cleaner fuels it needs today, these teams are on a path to developing lower carbon projects that both complement our systems and are profitable. We would not have thrown the amount of horsepower into these initiatives if we didn't believe in their potential and profitability for our company. We had our best year ever for safety in 2021. There's no doubt in my mind that our employees truly care about one another and the communities where we operate. As we said in the press release, we are extremely proud and grateful for the teamwork and contribution of our 7,000 employees to Enterprise's financial, operating and safety performance in 2021. Over the last two years, COVID-19 has whipsawed the global economy, including the U.S. energy sector. As always is the case, our people responded. In 2021, it was their efforts that enabled 3 of our 4 business segments to report record earnings that resulted in our company posting record gross operating margin, cash flow from operations and free cash flow. Regardless of the situation, whether it's a freeze that shuts down the entire state, the world went into a dark hole caused by a global pandemic are the complete opposite in 2021 when demand and prices for our products and services soared, our people proved to be creative and determined. We want to thank each and every one of them for yet another outstanding performance in 2021. Today, Randy and I are largely going to focus on \u201821 results, and you'll probably have a lot of questions about 2022. But before we get to Randy, I'll finish with our thoughts on the changing sentiments around oil and gas. For some time now, the sentiment towards all traditional forms of energy, especially in political circles has been very negative. Many said that the world should pull the plug on traditional energy as soon as possible and completely devote our capital and efforts toward renewable energy. Without a doubt, this was always nai\u0308ve. The world now realizes that an overnight transition to renewable sources of energy is not at all possible as evidenced by the rapid development of various global crises, including high natural gas and LNG prices, high crude oil prices not seen since 2014 and runaway inflation not seen for about 40 years. Europe is starved for gas and is faced with heat or eat, while Russia with its major oil and gas supplier is amassing troops on the Ukraine border. Try as you may, it's hard to blame these crises on the pandemic. Over one-third of the world lives in energy poverty, mainly in developing countries. Europe's energy policies have now made energy poverty a reality in first world countries. As an oil analyst said, energy is the economy. We, in the United States, live in a country of plenty. We are origination with the high quality of life of creative culture, now also blessed with abundant energy. Maybe that has distorted our thinking about the situation in other countries or regions. People who don't want developing nations to have what we have are either in denial, hypocrites or both. At Enterprise, we've been outspoken that is going to take all of the above, not for a few years, but for decades to come. Look to comments made by a variety of sources, everyone from the IEA to the Head of Saudi Aramco, members of the European Union and even the U.S. Energy Secretary. Ultimately, they all message the same thing: Investment in oil and gas needs to ramp up sharply in order to provide the badly needed baseload traditional sources of energy that will be needed alongside low-carbon fuels and green energy to meet the world's growing demand. At Enterprise, we've never seen supplying energy to meet growing needs as two competing paths. We're going to remain focused on supplying the world with a clean, low-cost and reliable fuels it needs today, while also playing a role and important part in developing lower carbon alternatives. I think I've said enough. Randy, I'll let you. You want to take it, Brent, or do you want me to? So 240 is really your instantaneous, 200 is basically your operating. I'll start it out and then take it from there. When we see increases on the domestic side, those are weather-related. At the end of the day, Tristan, the market for the incremental NGLs from the United States, which are substantial, is going to be at the dock. There's just no doubt about it. And unless Justin feels otherwise, we're going to say they're largely pointed towards Asia. Am I missing something? Go ahead, Tony. Yes. I mean, if you look at our system, we have a lot of options, and you mentioned that we can repurpose certain assets, but call it, late 2024, we'll be assessing whether we can do some brownfield expansions or evaluated greenfield project. Jean Ann, I want to make the assumption that it's -- M2E2 is the one that gets repurposed. I mean, there's some other better cost alternatives than potentially that one. Go ahead, Tony. Last year? \u201821 is between $800 million and $1 billion. And I'd say, 2022 is probably going to be between $500 million and $800 million. I think I love Randy's -- what Randy says. Price matters and it has to fit our value chain. So, I don't think -- you never say never, but it's got to meet some criteria. If you look at anything that Enterprise has ever done in terms of acquisitions, invariably, it brings something to the total value chain. And that's a criteria we're not going to breach. The way we look at what we see over the next few years, commodity exposure isn't necessarily a bad thing for us. I think we've -- Chris, we -- I think you said we had 18% commodity exposure last year? Was that your number? Where I saw that number -- but it's not -- my point is, in this environment, a little more commodity exposure is not a bad thing. Where is Natalie? Do you want to answer it? You can take the mask off to answer it. Did that answer your question, sir? Okay. DeWanda, before you give the replay information, we'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for our call. And the Company is going to sign off now, and if you would go ahead and give the replay information to our listeners. Thank you. Goodbye."

Some of that on the revenue side, we have a variable cost component. And so as gas prices go higher, you're seeing our revenue go up, but our expenses are also going up. Yes. It should be. So, a lot of what you're seeing on the increase is the commodity exposure on the blending margins. As far as frac margins as a fee base, there hasn't been a significant change there, nor do we sort of see one in the near future. Correct. As gas prices go up, our fees go up, offset by some higher operational expenses."

            "name": "Randy Fowler",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Starting with the fourth quarter income statement items. Net income attributable to common unitholders for the fourth quarter was $1 billion or $0.47 per unit on a fully diluted basis compared to $337 million or $0.15 per common unit on a fully diluted basis for the fourth quarter of last year. Net income was reduced by noncash asset impairment charges of $120 million or $0.05 per unit in the fourth quarter of 2021. This compares to $800 million or $0.36 per common unit for asset impairment charges of fourth quarter 2020. So, before the impairment charges, EPU was $0.52 per unit for 2021 compared to $0.51 per unit for 2020. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter 2020. On a full year basis, cash flow from operations was $8.5 billion and $5.9 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash flow from operations benefited from approximately $1.4 billion of net cash provided by changes in working capital accounts in 2021. By comparison, cash flow from operations was reduced by $768 million in 2020 due to changes in working capital. So if you would, a swing of $2.2 billion between the two years. Again, doing the math, cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $7.1 billion for 2021 compared to $6.7 billion in 2020. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $6.3 billion compared to $2.7 billion for 2020. Before cash provided by changes in working capital, free cash flow was $4.9 billion in 2021 compared to $3.4 billion in 2020. We declared a distribution of $0.465 per common unit with regard to the fourth quarter of 2021, which represents a 3.3% increase compared to the distribution that we declared for the fourth quarter of 2020. This distribution will be paid February 11th to all common unitholders of record as of the close of business, January 31st. During the fourth quarter, we also repurchased approximately $125 million or 5.8 million common units. This brought our repurchases under our buyback program to $200 million or 9.2 million common units for 2021. As of year-end 2021, we have utilized 24% of our outstanding $2 billion buyback program, which was authorized in 2019. In addition to these buybacks, Enterprise's distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined $37 million of EPD common units in the open market during the fourth quarter of \u201821 and $144 million for the full year. Our payout ratio, which we define as the sum of our cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from operations before working capital changes was 58% for 2021. The payout, the return of capital to investors includes $4 billion of declared distributions and $200 million of common unit buybacks. Our 2021 payout ratio as a percent of free cash flow before cash provided by changes in working capital was 84%. As we previously discussed, our capital allocation strategy remains focused on an all-the-above approach, investing in quality midstream infrastructure with attractive returns, supporting and growing distributions, executing buybacks opportunistically, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. In terms of capital investments in the fourth quarter, total capital investments were $424 million, which included $325 million of growth CapEx and $99 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Total capital investments in 2021 were $2.2 billion, which included investments in growth capital projects of $1.8 billion and $430 million for sustaining CapEx. For 2022, we estimate growth capital investments to be approximately $1.5 billion. This estimate does not include capital investments associated with the partnership's proposed Seaport Oil Terminal, SPOT, which remains subject to governmental approval. We currently expect sustaining capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $350 million. We currently expect the acquisition of Navitas to close in the first quarter of 2022 and our estimate of $1.5 billion in growth CapEx in 2022 includes any Navitas related CapEx in the year. Our total debt principal outstanding was $29.8 billion as of December 31, 2021. Assuming the first call date or final maturity date of our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio was 16.5 years and 20.7 years, respectively. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.4%. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $7.3 billion at December 31, 2021, including availability under our bank credit facilities and approximately $2.8 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. This amount of cash on hand, while elevated by historical standards, was reduced this morning as we retired $750 million of senior notes that matured and we will retire an additional $650 million of senior notes on February 15th. Further, as we previously communicated, we expect to fund our acquisition of Navitas with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the partnership's existing commercial paper facility and bank credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $2.1 billion and $8.4 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021. Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.1 times after adjusting debt for the partial equity trade of hybrid securities by the rating agencies and also being reduced by the partnership's unrestricted cash on. With that, Randy, we can open it up for questions. Colton, this is Randy. We've -- our payout ratio has really been averaging between 56% and 62% of cash flow from operations before working capital changes. And I think we'll most likely be in that range in 2022. Well, I mean, it is an allocation of capital for $3.25 billion that we'll pay for. So, some of our -- as we mentioned, we'll have some cash on hand after we've come in and pay this debt maturities in February. So, some of the cash would go towards the purchase price as well as borrowings on our bank credit facility. Yes. That's just something in the past, we haven't done Chase and it's hard. I mean, there's times where we step up for some last bit of remaining capacity that we can overperform from an operation standpoint, and we'll take on a minute amount of risk. But ultimately the folks that are realizing $85 a barrel and the folks that are realizing gas prices at these levels and NGL prices at these levels, and terms of how we go pitch projects, those are the ones, that probably need to step up. Can we be complementary to it? Possibly, but to me, ultimately, this is about producers stepping up to get this project done. We think that we -- I think everybody knows they're bringing a new plan on as we speak. We understand they have plans for an additional plan. Frankly, I don't think we know whether it's what their existing customers or what their plans are. So, we haven't dug in too deep going through this regulatory process. I believe so, and correct me on this. But, Michael, those were not renewed. Those contracts were to support the expansion from a number of years ago. And there's those volumes are still flowing on this. They're just kind of rolling at the tariff rate -- I'm sorry, there is deficiency revenue we are recognizing that we were no longer recognizing. And Spiro, this is Randy. I'd just add, Navitas is special because not only did it broaden our natural gas business into the Midland Basin where we didn't have anything, it also broadened relationships with customers that we already had. And as Jim said, it's complementary to our system. And again, the other thing is the cash accretion on the deal was superior to any assumption on buybacks. And also, no matter where we assume synergy capture, or even if we don't capture $1 of synergies, this was superior doing a leverage parity buyback. So, very excited about the Navitas deal. And again, it's a special transaction. Yes. Hi, Keith. Good morning. Yes, we were -- what we were finding is when we were coming in and just talking about sanctioned projects only, it was tending to I guess it was understating really where we thought our CapEx would be. And I think Jim's highlighted that we are working on a number of projects. And we came out this year and said, look, rather than coming in and trying to do surgery on what's sanctioned and what's not sanctioned that we're working on, the $1.5 billion is just where we think we're going to wind up for the year. And those are the sanctioned projects that we've been talking about that are included on that sheet that you saw in our supplemental slides that we posted this morning. And it was also some -- it also included these projects under development as well. The difference between the $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, I think there are some small things that we're doing from a natural gas gathering standpoint over the next two, three years that aggregated enough, it rounded to another $100 million. So, if you would have made that schedule. Yes. And I'll take a shot at this and Jim and Brent may want to come in and add some color. I think the way we look at it, just when we think about our equity NGL production, we're probably adding probably an incremental 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day of liquids exposure as a result of the Navitas deal. Yes. And what Jim is highlighting is actually on page 9 of our supplemental slide deck. If you look over the last few years and really put that on the other side, when we come in and think about our fee-based earnings, they've ranged from 82% to 87% over the last three years. In 2021, it was 82%. So, spread related and commodity based was the 18%. And coming in and what we've said in the past, we really don't mind a lower fee because that just means our commodity businesses are doing better. And again, just expanding on what Jim said, in this world where there -- and again, we think some of this is turning, but where there is an underinvestment in oil and gas globally, we just think from a structure standpoint, commodity prices will hold up well, and we just want more exposure to it. Okay. DeWanda, this is Randy. We have time for one more question before we terminate the call."

        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Brent Secrest",
            "content": "Yes. This is Brent Secrest. It feels like a lot of the majors and the bigger publics out there are fairly well set in terms of the gas takeaway capacity. Most of the customers that we deal with and you can see our customer list, they seem like they're in pretty good shape. So, when it comes to basis, in the past, the private guys have probably been the last ones to step up for capacity. And it's benefited them in this environment from a crude perspective, from a gas perspective and some other things that they have had to and there was other people that stepped up to get projects done and to remove those type of basis dislocations. Ultimately, somebody is going to need to step up or a collection of people are going to need to step up. And every month that goes by without a gas pipeline being announced is just going to add to the problem. But there are certainly opportunities for us as Enterprise in terms of the capacity that we have remained open to participate in these types of dislocations. We talk to our customers about a potential for a pipeline project, but right now, we haven't been able to get anything done on that side. So, I think this is the first full quarter that we've seen the Rocky Mountain contract roll-off in effect. On the Permian side, there's some incentive rates that are in place. So, those are there to stay for a while. And then, if you look at across the MAPL system, the fact of the matter is in the fourth quarter, we didn't really get much of a winter. So, from a propane demand perspective, quarter -- fourth quarter to fourth quarter, we saw some effects of that. We're seeing a good January and a good start to the year, but there were some -- definitely some effects to propane lack of demand domestically."

            "name": "Anthony Chovanec",
            "content": "It's certainly... Yes. Well, I'll tell you what, Teague, do you want to take it? Obviously, the publics remain very committed to discipline. That said, if you look at what Chevron has said in the last couple of days, you look at what Exxon said this morning, the Permian is their hot basin and they're both going to increase activity there for 2022 and beyond. The other thing that's very hard to get your arms around is there's a lot of acreage, and I hate to just use that term generically that's changing hands and what I would call is Tier 2 acreage. And that will be drilled. The private equities are picking it up and the privates are picking it up. So, that's how we see it. We see rig counts, completions continuing to be added, and it's very profitable. As Brent talked about, the gas takeaway situation has to be resolved. But we've been really, really outspoken about a large number. People thought it was very large, 1.8 million barrels for \u201821, \u201822 and \u201823, that's crude oil production. And you can think about somewhere between 800,000 and 900,000 barrels of NGLs associated with that. And if you look at the crude oil number that the EIA published in December, we're talking 600,000 barrels of increase in 2021. So, it's not a stretch to say that that $1.8 million is probably a little on the low side, as is the liquids number. Did that answer your question, Michael? Yves, this is Tony. We've always felt that that area was challenged. The rock, the resource is tremendous, both for dry gas and for NGL rich. The resource is incredible. But getting it out and getting it to market remains a challenge. And so, I think, you see the producers in the capital markets calibrating in that way. The question, just -- so I wondered three or four years ago, where is the incremental gas going to come from? Is it going to come from Appalachia or Haynesville? Well, it's clear now that it's going to come from the Haynesville. 50 rigs, 20 frac crews working. And as Natalie mentioned, Cotton Valley, we see the Haynesville on the marginal gas molecule as being the provider outside of oil-related gas."

Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Jim.\nJim Teague : Thank you, Randy. Our businesses continued to perform extremely well during the third quarter. We reported $2 billion of EBITDA even though we were impacted by $30 million of headwinds due to hurricane Ida. Cash flow from operations was a record $2.4 billion, which more than fully funded both our capital expenditures and our distributions. Year-to-date distributable cash flow is almost $5 billion, which has provided coverage of 1.7x and $2 billion in retained cash year-to-date. As we head into the final quarter of the year, while we don't take anything for granted, it looks like our businesses are going to finish with another strong year in 2021. Our results reflect the ongoing recovery in demand for crude, NGLs, primary petrochemicals and refined products as the global economy continues to recover. For 2022, most experts agree on continued strong demand and economic growth worldwide. We believe that economic backdrop plus the need to restock virtually everything will continue to provide strong demand growth for oil and gas, natural gas liquids and plastics. In addition to the record cash flow from operations, we had record profits from our propylene business, which contributed to the record gross operating income for our petrochemical and refined product service sector. Our PDH and splitters complement one another in our value chain, and we were able to take advantage of strong propylene spreads. Long term, petrochemical fundamentals are very strong and U.S. petrochemicals have multiple competitive advantages compared to almost all of their global peers. And likewise, Enterprise remains strongly positioned to provide the petrochemicals midstream services, including feedstock, storage, distribution and exports. It's a footprint that's not easily copied. Our liquids pipelines have substantially recovered to near pre-pandemic levels at 6.3 million barrels a day with gas processing volumes benefiting from higher prices for NGLs. Enterprise's natural gas pipeline and transportation for the third quarter exceeded pre-pandemic 2019 levels at a record 14.6 Bcf a day. In total, our crude oil equivalent pipeline transportation volumes were 10.1 million barrels a day for the quarter. NGL fractionation volumes remained supported at 1.3 million barrels a day. Our propylene production for the third quarter of 2021 was 96,000 barrels a day. Liquid volumes handled by our marine terminals for the third quarter were 1.5 million barrels a day. We completed construction of approximately $480 million of organic growth projects. These projects are in various stages -- varying stages of startup. The major projects include a natural gasoline hydrotreater, which reduces sulfur content and blend stocks used for motor gasoline and several petrochemical pipelines and natural gas pipelines that expand those integrated systems. We expect to complete the Acadian Haynesville and Gillis lateral natural gas pipeline expansions in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Acadian Haynesville gas pipelines are strategically located to move growing Haynesville and Cotton Valley natural gas supplies to growing and higher-valued industrial and LNG markets. We have developed a -- an impactful project to utilize hydrogen as a fuel at our PDH 2 plant. This project will provide significant environmental benefits as well as upgrade the co-product value of produced hydrogen. The change involves adding the capability to utilize hydrogen produced by the facility is fueled rather than relying on natural gas. By modifying the design of the heaters for PDH 2, we will reduce the plant's absolute carbon equivalent emissions by almost 90%. Construction of PDH 2 remains on schedule and on budget with completion expected in the second quarter of 2023. We became very bullish on hydrocarbon prices on April 20, 2020. And at $80 a barrel, crude oil has increased in excess of $30 since the beginning of the year and propylene and natural gas prices have doubled since the 1st of the year. U.S. oil and gas industry is now in the hands of highly disciplined parties. We like to believe they prefer doing business with large and similarly responsible companies like us. But now crude oil pricing remains on a path that is dictated by OPEC+, who need to receive higher prices for their products in order to balance their budgets and improve their economy. Clearly, they don't seem to be interested in any more price wars. OPEC is also signaling that they believe the world is going to need every barrel we can get our hands on in the future, including U.S. sales. We believe natural gas now has a sustained price up to $3 plus in order to encourage nonassociated production in places like the Haynesville and the lean Eagle Ford. Likewise, we believe that all signs point to some level of staying power for the stronger price to WTI ratios we are seeing for propane and butane. Over the last 10 years, we've seen significant growth in global demand for U.S. liquids because of their price transparency, environmental attributes and transportability. We're very proud of what has evolved into a hydrocarbon franchise that has a strong domestic presence and a global reach. And with that, Randy, it's yours.\nRandy Fowler: Okay. Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. In looking at the income statement, Net income attributable to common unitholders for the third quarter of 2021 was $1.2 billion or $0.52 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.1 billion or $0.48 per common unit on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter of 2020. Net income was reduced by noncash asset impairment charges of $29 million or $0.01 per unit for the third quarter of this year, and this compares to a charge of $77 million or $0.03 per unit for the third quarter of last year. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flows from operations was $2.4 billion for the third quarter of 2021. This compares to $1.1 billion for the third quarter of last year. It should be noted that the third quarter of 2021 cash flow from operations benefited by $648 million of net cash provided by changes in working capital accounts. The swing in cash provided by or used for working capital accounts between the 2 quarters accounts for substantially all of the $1.3 billion favorable variance between the 2 quarters. Free cash flow for the 12 months ended September 30, 2021, which is cash flow from operations less investing activities less net cash flow to noncontrolling interest, our JV partners was $5.6 billion, compared to $2.1 billion for the comparable trailing-12 months in 2020. We declared a distribution of $0.45 per unit with respect to the third quarter of 2021 to be paid on November 12. This distribution of approximately $1 billion for the quarter represents a 1.1% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $75 million or 3.4 million EPD common units. In addition to these buybacks, EPD's distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined $36 million or approximately 1.6 million EPD common units in the open market during the third quarter. Our payout ratio, which we define as the sum of cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from our operations for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021, as reported, was 51% and was 58% after adjusting cash flow from operations for cash provided by working capital changes. This is consistent with the 55% to 80% payout ratio we have maintained over the past decade, throughout volatile business cycles and the pandemic. We are in the middle of our planning process for the 2022 budget. Our priorities for capital allocation are all-of-the-above approach with a goal to facilitate the long-term financial health of the partnership. Our first priority is supporting and growing distributions to investors. Secondly, to support investments that complement our midstream system that have attractive rates of return in excess of our cost of capital with the objective of growing the partnership's cash flow per unit. Next is to maintain financial flexibility that enables us to weather business cycles and evolving legislative and regulatory risk to the energy sector. Finally, it will be to execute buybacks on an opportunistic basis. As we have for the past several years, we plan to announce distribution growth guidance for 2022 in January. During the quarter, we issued $1 billion of senior notes at a fixed rate coupon of 3.3%, with the net proceeds to be used for general company purposes, including the repayment of our $750 million, 3.5% senior notes and our $650 million of 4.05% senior notes that mature in February 2022. We elected to issue during the third quarter rather than refinancing in 2022 to avoid interest rate risk. We were able to extend these maturities by 30 years while reducing the coupon of the debt by almost 0.5 percentage point. We would like to thank our fixed income investors for their continued support as this offering was -- had over $4 billion of demand on the busiest issuance day of the year. During the quarter, we also renewed our 364-day and multiyear revolving credit facilities in September. In addition to extending the tenure of these facilities, we proactively decided to reduce the overall size of the multiyear facility by $500 million to $3.0 billion. Together with our $1.5 billion 364-day facility, we have $4.5 billion of borrowing capacity under these facilities. Over the past 2 years, we have proactively reduced Enterprise's bank credit commitments by a total of $1.5 billion or 25%. This has principally been in response to our lower level of expected capital expenditures while also trying to be a responsible client to our bank, many of whom have been under investor pressure to reduce capital commitments to the traditional energy industry. Our total debt principal outstanding was $29.8 billion as of September 30, 2021. Assuming the first call date or the final maturity date for our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio is 16.8 years and 20.9 years, respectively. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.4%. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $6.7 billion at September 30, 2021, including available -- which includes availability under our bank credit facilities and approximately $2.2 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. This amount of cash on hand, while elevated by historical standards is primarily due to having already completed our refinancing and having cash available to retire $1.4 billion of senior notes in the first quarter of next year. It also provides us additional flexibility to respond to market opportunities. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2021 was $2 billion and $8.3 billion for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021. Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.2x after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of the hybrid debt securities and reduced by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand. With that, Randy, we can open it up for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Randy. Dylan, we're ready to take questions from our listeners. [Operator  Instructions] Thank you. Go ahead, Dylan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS.\nShneur Gershuni: I was wondering if you can share your latest thoughts around potentially accelerating return of capital. Many of your peers are pursuing buybacks. Some have announced special increases and so forth, we're seeing positive stock reactions. A lot of the producer customers are electing to pursue buybacks instead of investing in growth. And so kind of wondering about your latest thoughts. In the past, you've mentioned some uncertainty with respect to Washington, but there's now a draft reconciliation bill out. Has that thought process changed at all? And if so, is there a preference towards buyback given where the stock is trading or would you be thinking about these distribution increases or special distribution increases?\nRandy Fowler : Okay. Shneur, I appreciate the question this morning. Here -- as we stated in prepared remarks, I think our -- when we think about allocation of capital, it's all-of-the-above approach. We have been deliberate on buybacks. And some of that is because of the legislative and regulatory uncertainty. And we -- as far as -- looking out, we're still working, you may see clarity in Washington, D.C, we don't. And I think we'll get -- will come in and get better clarity over the next few months. On the buyback activity that you mentioned from, I guess, you were referring to Magellan and MPLX, I think we need to give a little bit more time to see market reaction to that. There were a couple of research notes that we saw was -- where -- what was it -- they -- during the time period that they did buybacks that Magellan actually underperformed in that August and September period during the point in time when they actually did buybacks. And then since the time they announced all those buybacks, they had pretty much performed in line with others. So I think -- I don't think we're ready to make a knee-jerk reaction to their performance or the outperformance as a result of the buyback. I would also note that if we go back and look at several years, we're allocating a good bit of cash. In fact, we're one of the highest in paying out returning capital to our investors. And again, that's principally through distributions. Magellan has come in. I'll note, Magellan has come in, in the last year and really increase their payout ratio, but a lot of that has been as a result of proceeds from asset sales that they've been returning to investors, which makes sense. We -- but if you've noticed, we just not had much in the way of proceeds to asset sales. So we'll be coming in. We're going through our 2020 budget cycle. We'll come in and announce what our plans are for distribution increase next year in January. I would note that 2021 marks our 23rd year of distribution growth. I don't think any other midstream company can say that. And so it's our practice to return capital to investors and that includes both distributions and buybacks. And -- but we'll come in and we need to go through our budget cycle to come in and provide any more clarity on that.\nJim Teague: You did a pretty good job in your script laying out the priorities we look at, right?\nRandy Fowler: Right.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay. I appreciate the color. I guess I was thinking along the lines of that you've got a $4 billion annual distribution and that if you reduce the unit count that it would actually fund more distribution growth in the future. But I guess we'll wait and see for the next update. Maybe pivoting a little bit here. Your CapEx growth range for the next year, kind of -- you sort of tightened the range and you sort of seem to have a $1.5 billion cap, I guess, for next year. Is that the winning process of some prospects dropping off and if some ideas dropped off the table? Or is it a function of producers continue to remain disciplined on production and more focused on buybacks? Just kind of wondering on the tightening of the range there.\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Shneur, on that, not anything has dropped off the table as far as projects under development that really that we've been referring to the first 9 months of this year. It's more just from a standpoint of maybe timing of when some of those capital expenditures would hit in 2022.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay. So -- but at the end of the day, the high end, right now, you're looking at is $1.5 billion for growth CapEx.\nRandy Fowler: Shneur, as we sit here today on November 2, our best estimate for growth CapEx in 2022 is $1 billion to $1.5 billion. That will be subject to change as we get into \u2013 as things develop.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: I just wanted to start off with the Build Back Better bill and just see if it's passed -- as it's written today, how that might impact Enterprise going forward, be it the higher 45Q levels, be it including renewables. Just wondering what impacts that would have -- could have on your business if it is passed?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Jeremy, again, you guys in New York must have a better visibility to D.C. than what we see. Because I mean, from what we've seen, the Build Back Better plan is still a great deal of plugs and statements that have come out of the Senate, especially Senate Finance Committee, there -- it sounds like they are still pursuing some proposals there. So I think everything is really still in very much in a state of plug. So from the standpoint of first in Senate Finance Committee, you've got -- where they were looking to eliminate oil and gas tax preference items, which again includes the qualified earnings for MLPs attributable to fossil fuels. The counter to that is on -- out of the house ways and means where you have -- they do not have the provision to eliminate the oil and gas tax preference items, which, again, are intangible drilling costs, cost depletion and MLPs. And in fact, they actually expand the qualified business activities for MLPs to pick up some renewable activities. And you've got some saying that the legislation is going to go from the House to the Senate but then we're hearing that also in the Senate that they want to start in the Senate and move to the House. So again, you guys and on the East Coast might have better visibility, but that's sort of the last thing we see. As far as on the 45Q credits, it is encouraging that they are looking to come in and increase the amount of credits, I think, in order to come in and get carbon sequestration, whether it's sequestration or whether it's through EOR, I think the credits do need to be higher. It's also encouraging to see a direct pay be included in that as well. But I think we -- right now, anything we would comment on would really just be pure speculation based on where the legislation is currently.\nJeremy Tonet: Okay. Maybe just taking a step back, just curious, I guess, Enterprise in past years has been kind of a top performer in the space. This year has not as much. Just wondering what you think could be the driver of the relative performance this year? And could anything be kind of changed going forward to help that out?\nJim Teague: You answer that one.\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Jeremy, we're -- from a business standpoint, we're putting up good numbers. I would go back and we think we're doing our part as far as returns on capital, the cash flow that we're generating, the performance that we're recording throughout business cycles. As I said on the last call, when we come back in and look at probably our highest correlation is to the S&P energy sector. And I think that's the comp we're -- that's the comp that we track most closely. As far as coming in and comparing to various midstream companies, hard to say. Every dog has its today. And we're going to continue to execute on what we're doing well. And our allocation of capital strategy is going to be all of the above.\nJim Teague: And we just keep doing 1.7x coverage, keep retaining a lot of cash and sooner or later, it pays off.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury: In the release, you note that your major Permian and Rockies NGL pipelines were down $31 million versus 3Q 2020 due to lower fees and volumes. Can you expand on what's happening? I had thought that NGL pipelines were kind of relatively safe from rate competition. And I'm not clear also if that $31 million is related to the Hurricane Ida impacts that you referenced.\nBrent Secrest: Jean Ann, this is Brent. There's volumes in the Rockies that continue to decline. We started to see a little bit of rig activity up there, but for most part, volumes are declining. Also the fee structure up there has declined in the third quarter. In terms of the Permian, we offered some incentive rates in the short term on transportation to help entice volumes. And then, Tug, I'm looking at you on impacts from the hurricane, I don't think we had any big impacts from the hurricane as it relates to MAPL.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up is on the Texas Intrastate, kind of a similar question. There was a $34 million decrease from 3Q '20 based on lower capacity reservations. I think that makes sense because overall utilization on gas pipelines, Whistler kind of started, but it feels like it should improve from here. There's no more new pipelines coming. Is that kind of what you're seeing as well? Or do you think that you could see Texas Intrastate go lower in the next few quarters as more contracts roll?\nBrent Secrest: Okay. I think going forward, Jean Ann, you're going to see those volumes increase and those margins get better.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess just like quickly following up on what you said about -- sorry, the answer to my first question about the incentive rates from the Permian. Is that like a competitive situation, I guess, where that plant has multiple pipelines and you're trying to get them to use Enterprise instead of a third party.\nBrent Secrest: That\u2019s it. At the end of the day, if we can cover our costs and make some money, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. But ultimately, a lot of these processing plants in the Permian, it\u2019s a very efficient market, and we just have to compete harder.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: I guess first thing I wanted to follow up on was the propylene business. Gross margin was pretty strong coming in at $260 million, and this was despite 34 days of unplanned downtime on PDH 1. So I guess maybe could you just talk to that a little bit, what drove that? And then how sustainable on a go-forward basis, do you think this $260 million gross operating margin number is?\nJim Teague: Chris, do you want to take it?\nChris D'Anna: Sure. Chase, this is Chris D'Anna. Overall, we have several -- actually a significant number of contracts that are structured in a way that it's a fixed fee, but when the spread blows out, we participate. So a lot of what you saw this quarter is some of that benefit. And as to sustainability, I think you just look at the global supply chain issues across many industries. And when that gets solved, maybe we return back to some normalcy and spreads. But until then, I think we'll continue to see wide spreads.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. All right. On a follow-up, just kind of thinking about ethane and LPG exports as we kind of move into 2022, kind of what underlying trends are you seeing today? And what do you expect to see in the 2022 for LPG and ethylene exports.\nJim Teague: Did you say ethane or ethylene or both?\nChase Mulvehill: I said ethane. Well, you can talk to both if you want to. I'll slide that in there as well.\nJim Teague: Justin? And then Chris.\nJustin Kleiderer: Yes, Chase, this is Justin Kleiderer. With respect to ethane and LPG, I mean, ethane is probably more of a domestic story versus LPG. But I think both the case remains, which is demand will continue to outstrip the pace of supply growth as we forecasted. So we feel good about our LPG export dock continuing to remain at full regardless of how it's contracted today, and we continue to feel good about ethane prices as a whole because domestically, we still think demand is going to outstrip supply.\nJim Teague: And what you -- how full are you on ethane exports, right now?\nJustin Kleiderer: November should be a record month.\nJim Teague: Okay. Chris, ethylene?\nChris D'Anna: Yes. The same for ethylene, November is going to be a record month for us. And we\u2019re 95% contracted to the nameplate, but we\u2019ve demonstrated we can run much higher than nameplate.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: I think I recall there might have been -- just following up on propylene. There might have been a local press article saying the company was considering adding another splitter. Is that something you'd be exploring with the market conditions very strong and I guess how do you think about the economics for that? And then relatedly, the potential upside to CapEx for next year going to $1 billion to $1.5 billion, is that tied to a particular chunky project or several smaller ones?\nJim Teague: As far as a splitter, I think some of the projects we're working on that we haven't finalized, we'll dictate whether we look at another splitter. Do you have anything on that, Chris?\nChris D'Anna: And Graham can comment on this, but we have a pretty standard process for projects and the tax piece is the first step of that. So that's probably what you saw in the press.\nJim Teague: What was the rest of the question?\nUnidentified Company Representative: The $1 billion to $1.5 billion.\nJim Teague: I think we're working on -- as Randy said, we're working on some projects that if they come about, well that could see a little bit of an upturn in that CapEx. Right, Tug?\nMichael Hanley: That's right.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. And Keith, that's just not one chunky project. That's several projects.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. Okay. Got it. And then -- just a clarification question on the special distribution concept, which you referenced MPLX. I don't think Randy, that was in your list of options, but is a special distribution something you would think about and consider next year if you had excess cash and just how you think about that versus buybacks? I'm assuming it's more efficient in your view to do a special if that was an option.\nRandy Fowler: Keith, I think our focus would really be more on regular way increasing the base distribution, and then we\u2019ll see what we do on buybacks. And the buybacks, obviously, all depend on opportunistic buybacks, market conditions and also business opportunities at the time.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum : I just want to talk a little bit about the Haynesville. You've seen a little bit of an uptick in your systems around there. Wondering if you can just give us an idea of if you're seeing producers -- increased producer activity there. And what's sort of driving the uptick in volumes on those systems?\nJim Teague: Do you want to take it?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. So we're seeing increased activity from our existing producer customers. But not only that, we're seeing new opportunities arise from potential new customers, some hit in the Cotton Valley but all from a gathering, treating and processing perspective. I'd say, we're working on a project to expand Acadian one more time, adding 400 million a day. So by the time that's done, Gillis will add 1.025 Bcf a day of takeaway to LNG markets, and then we'll add another 400 of Acadian capacity after that.\nMichael Blum: Got it. That's helpful. And then an interesting announcement around hydrogen for PDH 2. Just curious, is it feasible to look at PDH 1 and like trying to retrofit it effectively for the same hydrogen application? Or is that not possible?\nJim Teague: Graham or Angie?\nGraham Bacon: Graham, I'll take that. I think to a limited extent we can, but the technology lends itself better to the technology we've used for PDH 2. There's a lot more technical hurdles to overcome on PDH 1.\nJim Teague: What about other plants that your contracts roll up, Graham?\nGraham Bacon: I think we've got other opportunities where we can -- where our contracts roll off, and we've got optionality on how we look at hydrogen, versus the market, how we consume and as well as the consumers in the facility, there's some options there. Some of the other units that are probably more suited to hydrogen than may be even PDH 1. And we're taking a look at all of those right now.\nJim Teague: We've been -- Michael we've been selling our hydrogen, what I think Graham is saying is, as those contracts roll off, there ought to be other opportunities for us to use that hydrogen.\nGraham Bacon: And you\u2019ve got that option. We\u2019ve got that option to the market or internally.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cusimano from Pickering and Partners.\nMichael Cusimano: So the press release mentioned lower NGL marketing activities as an impact of hedging. I was hoping you could talk about the significance of those hedges as well as how it affects 4Q and then moving into '22?\nBrentSecrest: I think in terms -- I'll talk -- this is Brent. In terms of the margins on NGLs, it's more a function of contango storage place that we had in the past. And in terms of the hedging aspect, Justin?\nJustin Kleiderer: Yes, I think any hedges you see there are -- will be realized when physical delivery of product is made. So I would view those as transitory. And I think to Brent's point, the second half of 2020 saw a significant storage revenue as a function of April of 2020 in COVID.\nMichael Cusimano: Okay. So it's less of a -- there's not much like NGL equity exposure that you've hedged away that would be impacting that?\nJustin Kleiderer: We have very little processing exposure hedged.\nMichael Cusimano: Okay. And then staying on the NGL segment, it looks like the ethane rejection from higher natural gas prices negatively affected the NGL segment, like looking quarter-to-quarter. Can you talk about what you're seeing today relative to 3Q? And then also if that rejection in the NGL segment improved what you saw in the natural gas segment for 3Q?\nBrent Secrest: I think in terms of what we see going forward, so you\u2019re accurate in terms of the rejection that was going on within our system. In terms of going forward, we\u2019re going to have to watch to see how fast producers get back. But I think ultimately, it comes a point in time, and we\u2019ll see when it happens where the demand of the petrochemical sector is going to outstrip supply. So we\u2019ll see how far away ethane has to be to get recovered from places that aren\u2019t nearly as close to the Gulf Coast as the Permian or the Eagle Ford or Haynesville or some areas like that. I think that answers your question.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Ed Siegel from Siegel Asset Management.\nEd Siegel: I just have 2 questions. I guess I'm only allowed 2 questions, but in terms of growth going forward and capital expenditures going forward, what are the areas that excite you in terms of the opportunity set and could M&A be part of that? So that's one. And then the second is on inflation. And Randy, my crystal ball is pretty bad. But to the extent that we see inflation, what's the philosophy around the distribution regarding inflation? And are you focusing any inflationary pressures in the business right now?\nJim Teague: I'll take the first, Randy, you take the second one. In terms of what we -- some of the things we are -- we would like to do, Yves, is we've been pretty good at repurposing pipelines. So you can probably assume that we're looking at repurposing pipelines. And as far as M&A, I love what Randy has said all along where M&A is concerned, price matters, and we kick a lot of tires. And if the right price comes along, we're not going to -- we're probably going to have a look at it.\nEd Siegel: And can I just interrupt right there? Has there been a subtle shift in terms of how you think about M&A? I mean, from a -- and I get what you said about price. But strategically, is M&A becoming a little bit more interesting to you?\nJim Teague: I don't think anything's changed, Ed. By the way, that's your second question. I don't think anything's changed. I think maybe some valuations are little more -- are a little better. And that's what price matters means.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. And Ed going to, I guess, what is now your third question. On inflation, I want to say over 90% of our revenues have some sort of escalation mechanism in there, which are benchmarked to various indices. So we feel like we have a pretty good protection from inflation. I think Graham and his team have done a great job on our capital projects. As far as on long lead items, we've really been in pretty good shape as far as not seeing cost creep on those projects. As far as how we think about the distribution, we said -- really what we're trying to achieve is trying to keep to, what is it, purchase power parity. And so we would like to come in. And with the increased inflation, have an increase in the distribution growth rate compared to what you've seen over the last 3 or 4 years. And really, if I could use this just in terms of that, and this might get back to Jeremy's question of as far as recognition of the progress we've made and not showing up in the unit price. Some of it may be, what have you done for me lately? And we came in and we shifted our posture in 2017 to come in and be able to finance the business better rather than coming in and relying on both the debt and equity capital markets, I think we were the first mover in coming in and self-financing the business. First, it was providing our own sources of equity capital. And this year, our cash flow from operations is going to cover all of our CapEx. So I think we made that shift. And to a degree, it may come down to a long-term view and the -- and maybe because the feedback that we get from our long-term investors, they are quite pleased with what we've been doing. And it -- versus short term. And I think a good bit of the liquidity in the stock market these days is high velocity, short-term-oriented money, and which may not align with how we've been allocating capital over the last couple of years. But we think the way that we're progressing here is best for long term -- best for the long-term financial health of the partnership. We've been -- I go back. During this time period, you had a lot of MLPs, 150-plus, come in and cut distributions, and we did not. So as a result, they actually decreased the amount of capital they returned to their partners over the last 3 or 4 years, while we continue to increase ours. But now we're at a position of what have you done for me lately. You've got some people that might have a little bit more [indiscernible] in short-term gains that they can do because they cut their distribution so deeply. So again, we're running a long race here. We're mindful of returning capital. Again, we're going to come in and do the all-of-the-above approach. And -- but that's sort of a follow-up on Jeremy's questions without charging you an extra question, Jeremy.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.\nColton Bean: So a couple of follow-ups here. Following up a $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. Can you clarify what level of spend was contemplated for SPOT? Or was that not one of the development projects in there?\nJim Teague: That's not in that number.\nColton Bean: Got it. So that would be incremental to the range?\nJim Teague: Yes.\nColton Bean: Understood. And then maybe sickling back to NGL marketing. I can appreciate on a year-over-year basis, the impact of contango. But I think on a sequential basis, it also looked like there was a pretty material step down. So just trying to better understand what changed from Q2 to Q3 in the NGL marketing business? And then again, what the expectations are as we move towards the year-end and 2022?\nJustin Kleiderer: Yes, Colton, this is Justin Kleiderer. I mean I could sum it up pretty simply. It's just timing of spread capture, and that's going to change based upon markets.\nColton Bean: Okay. And also then I have a final one here. Brent, you talked on or touched on how far away ethane might need to be pulled from? I guess as you look across your system, whether it's ATEX or MAPL, are there any opportunities that you all see from increased extraction?\nBrent Secrest: I think there's -- Rockies volumes, ATEX to some extent. There's not a whole lot of capacity left on there, but we do have some. And then ultimately, I think the bulk of the volume could come from the Permian, the stuff that's being [reshifted] up there currently.\nOperator: I show our last question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Congrats on a decent quarter. Real quick, just curious how you're thinking about the battle between Corpus and Houston for crude export volumes. Obviously, export volumes have been pretty weak for the last couple of months. But just curious how you're thinking about the share over the next quarter or so and maybe even over the next 12 to 18 months?\nJim Teague: I don't know about the next quarter. I think ultimately, it becomes a battle between Corpus and SPOT. Brent?\nBrent Secrest: Look, to me, what's going on is something that we have preached for a long time about Houston being a market and Corpus being destination as some people get tired of hearing that, but I don't think in terms of the export business, they're one. I think it's just a function of where the pipelines end up and what they have to do. Ultimately, the value of the barrel is worth more domestically than it is across the water. So that's what you're seeing going on in Houston which -- frankly, we've got customers that have take-or-pay contracts and ultimately, what their netback is, is quite a bit higher domestically across our system in the Gulf Coast. Where we want to be long term is going across the VLCC dock. And ultimately, over time, we think that SPOT can pull the barrels away that want to go to the export markets.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you. And Dylan, we\u2019re ready to \u2013 for you to give our listeners the replay information, if you don\u2019t mind. And I\u2019d like to thank our participants for joining us today, and we\u2019re going to go ahead and go offline if you\u2019d give them that information. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir.

There's a lot more technical hurdles to overcome on PDH 1. I think we've got other opportunities where we can -- where our contracts roll off, and we've got optionality on how we look at hydrogen, versus the market, how we consume and as well as the consumers in the facility, there's some options there. Some of the other units that are probably more suited to hydrogen than may be even PDH 1. And we're taking a look at all of those right now. And you've got that option. We've got that option to the market or internally."

Overall, we have several -- actually a significant number of contracts that are structured in a way that it's a fixed fee, but when the spread blows out, we participate. So a lot of what you saw this quarter is some of that benefit. And as to sustainability, I think you just look at the global supply chain issues across many industries. And when that gets solved, maybe we return back to some normalcy and spreads. But until then, I think we'll continue to see wide spreads. Yes. The same for ethylene, November is going to be a record month for us. And we're 95% contracted to the nameplate, but we've demonstrated we can run much higher than nameplate. And Graham can comment on this, but we have a pretty standard process for projects and the tax piece is the first step of that. So that's probably what you saw in the press."

            "content": "Yes, Chase, this is Justin Kleiderer. With respect to ethane and LPG, I mean, ethane is probably more of a domestic story versus LPG. But I think both the case remains, which is demand will continue to outstrip the pace of supply growth as we forecasted. So we feel good about our LPG export dock continuing to remain at full regardless of how it's contracted today, and we continue to feel good about ethane prices as a whole because domestically, we still think demand is going to outstrip supply. November should be a record month. Yes, I think any hedges you see there are -- will be realized when physical delivery of product is made. So I would view those as transitory. And I think to Brent's point, the second half of 2020 saw a significant storage revenue as a function of April of 2020 in COVID. We have very little processing exposure hedged. Yes, Colton, this is Justin Kleiderer. I mean I could sum it up pretty simply. It's just timing of spread capture, and that's going to change based upon markets."

            "name": "Jim Teague",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Our businesses continued to perform extremely well during the third quarter. We reported $2 billion of EBITDA even though we were impacted by $30 million of headwinds due to hurricane Ida. Cash flow from operations was a record $2.4 billion, which more than fully funded both our capital expenditures and our distributions. Year-to-date distributable cash flow is almost $5 billion, which has provided coverage of 1.7x and $2 billion in retained cash year-to-date. As we head into the final quarter of the year, while we don't take anything for granted, it looks like our businesses are going to finish with another strong year in 2021. Our results reflect the ongoing recovery in demand for crude, NGLs, primary petrochemicals and refined products as the global economy continues to recover. For 2022, most experts agree on continued strong demand and economic growth worldwide. We believe that economic backdrop plus the need to restock virtually everything will continue to provide strong demand growth for oil and gas, natural gas liquids and plastics. In addition to the record cash flow from operations, we had record profits from our propylene business, which contributed to the record gross operating income for our petrochemical and refined product service sector. Our PDH and splitters complement one another in our value chain, and we were able to take advantage of strong propylene spreads. Long term, petrochemical fundamentals are very strong and U.S. petrochemicals have multiple competitive advantages compared to almost all of their global peers. And likewise, Enterprise remains strongly positioned to provide the petrochemicals midstream services, including feedstock, storage, distribution and exports. It's a footprint that's not easily copied. Our liquids pipelines have substantially recovered to near pre-pandemic levels at 6.3 million barrels a day with gas processing volumes benefiting from higher prices for NGLs. Enterprise's natural gas pipeline and transportation for the third quarter exceeded pre-pandemic 2019 levels at a record 14.6 Bcf a day. In total, our crude oil equivalent pipeline transportation volumes were 10.1 million barrels a day for the quarter. NGL fractionation volumes remained supported at 1.3 million barrels a day. Our propylene production for the third quarter of 2021 was 96,000 barrels a day. Liquid volumes handled by our marine terminals for the third quarter were 1.5 million barrels a day. We completed construction of approximately $480 million of organic growth projects. These projects are in various stages -- varying stages of startup. The major projects include a natural gasoline hydrotreater, which reduces sulfur content and blend stocks used for motor gasoline and several petrochemical pipelines and natural gas pipelines that expand those integrated systems. We expect to complete the Acadian Haynesville and Gillis lateral natural gas pipeline expansions in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Acadian Haynesville gas pipelines are strategically located to move growing Haynesville and Cotton Valley natural gas supplies to growing and higher-valued industrial and LNG markets. We have developed a -- an impactful project to utilize hydrogen as a fuel at our PDH 2 plant. This project will provide significant environmental benefits as well as upgrade the co-product value of produced hydrogen. The change involves adding the capability to utilize hydrogen produced by the facility is fueled rather than relying on natural gas. By modifying the design of the heaters for PDH 2, we will reduce the plant's absolute carbon equivalent emissions by almost 90%. Construction of PDH 2 remains on schedule and on budget with completion expected in the second quarter of 2023. We became very bullish on hydrocarbon prices on April 20, 2020. And at $80 a barrel, crude oil has increased in excess of $30 since the beginning of the year and propylene and natural gas prices have doubled since the 1st of the year. U.S. oil and gas industry is now in the hands of highly disciplined parties. We like to believe they prefer doing business with large and similarly responsible companies like us. But now crude oil pricing remains on a path that is dictated by OPEC+, who need to receive higher prices for their products in order to balance their budgets and improve their economy. Clearly, they don't seem to be interested in any more price wars. OPEC is also signaling that they believe the world is going to need every barrel we can get our hands on in the future, including U.S. sales. We believe natural gas now has a sustained price up to $3 plus in order to encourage nonassociated production in places like the Haynesville and the lean Eagle Ford. Likewise, we believe that all signs point to some level of staying power for the stronger price to WTI ratios we are seeing for propane and butane. Over the last 10 years, we've seen significant growth in global demand for U.S. liquids because of their price transparency, environmental attributes and transportability. We're very proud of what has evolved into a hydrocarbon franchise that has a strong domestic presence and a global reach. And with that, Randy, it's yours. You did a pretty good job in your script laying out the priorities we look at, right? You answer that one. And we just keep doing 1.7x coverage, keep retaining a lot of cash and sooner or later, it pays off. Chris, do you want to take it? Did you say ethane or ethylene or both? Justin? And then Chris. And what you -- how full are you on ethane exports, right now? Okay. Chris, ethylene? As far as a splitter, I think some of the projects we're working on that we haven't finalized, we'll dictate whether we look at another splitter. Do you have anything on that, Chris? What was the rest of the question? I think we're working on -- as Randy said, we're working on some projects that if they come about, well that could see a little bit of an upturn in that CapEx. Right, Tug? Do you want to take it? Graham or Angie? What about other plants that your contracts roll up, Graham? We've been -- Michael we've been selling our hydrogen, what I think Graham is saying is, as those contracts roll off, there ought to be other opportunities for us to use that hydrogen. I'll take the first, Randy, you take the second one. In terms of what we -- some of the things we are -- we would like to do, Yves, is we've been pretty good at repurposing pipelines. So you can probably assume that we're looking at repurposing pipelines. And as far as M&A, I love what Randy has said all along where M&A is concerned, price matters, and we kick a lot of tires. And if the right price comes along, we're not going to -- we're probably going to have a look at it. I don't think anything's changed, Ed. By the way, that's your second question. I don't think anything's changed. I think maybe some valuations are little more -- are a little better. And that's what price matters means. That's not in that number. Yes. I don't know about the next quarter. I think ultimately, it becomes a battle between Corpus and SPOT. Brent?"

            "name": "Randy Fowler",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. In looking at the income statement, Net income attributable to common unitholders for the third quarter of 2021 was $1.2 billion or $0.52 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.1 billion or $0.48 per common unit on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter of 2020. Net income was reduced by noncash asset impairment charges of $29 million or $0.01 per unit for the third quarter of this year, and this compares to a charge of $77 million or $0.03 per unit for the third quarter of last year. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flows from operations was $2.4 billion for the third quarter of 2021. This compares to $1.1 billion for the third quarter of last year. It should be noted that the third quarter of 2021 cash flow from operations benefited by $648 million of net cash provided by changes in working capital accounts. The swing in cash provided by or used for working capital accounts between the 2 quarters accounts for substantially all of the $1.3 billion favorable variance between the 2 quarters. Free cash flow for the 12 months ended September 30, 2021, which is cash flow from operations less investing activities less net cash flow to noncontrolling interest, our JV partners was $5.6 billion, compared to $2.1 billion for the comparable trailing-12 months in 2020. We declared a distribution of $0.45 per unit with respect to the third quarter of 2021 to be paid on November 12. This distribution of approximately $1 billion for the quarter represents a 1.1% increase compared to the third quarter of 2020. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $75 million or 3.4 million EPD common units. In addition to these buybacks, EPD's distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined $36 million or approximately 1.6 million EPD common units in the open market during the third quarter. Our payout ratio, which we define as the sum of cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from our operations for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021, as reported, was 51% and was 58% after adjusting cash flow from operations for cash provided by working capital changes. This is consistent with the 55% to 80% payout ratio we have maintained over the past decade, throughout volatile business cycles and the pandemic. We are in the middle of our planning process for the 2022 budget. Our priorities for capital allocation are all-of-the-above approach with a goal to facilitate the long-term financial health of the partnership. Our first priority is supporting and growing distributions to investors. Secondly, to support investments that complement our midstream system that have attractive rates of return in excess of our cost of capital with the objective of growing the partnership's cash flow per unit. Next is to maintain financial flexibility that enables us to weather business cycles and evolving legislative and regulatory risk to the energy sector. Finally, it will be to execute buybacks on an opportunistic basis. As we have for the past several years, we plan to announce distribution growth guidance for 2022 in January. During the quarter, we issued $1 billion of senior notes at a fixed rate coupon of 3.3%, with the net proceeds to be used for general company purposes, including the repayment of our $750 million, 3.5% senior notes and our $650 million of 4.05% senior notes that mature in February 2022. We elected to issue during the third quarter rather than refinancing in 2022 to avoid interest rate risk. We were able to extend these maturities by 30 years while reducing the coupon of the debt by almost 0.5 percentage point. We would like to thank our fixed income investors for their continued support as this offering was -- had over $4 billion of demand on the busiest issuance day of the year. During the quarter, we also renewed our 364-day and multiyear revolving credit facilities in September. In addition to extending the tenure of these facilities, we proactively decided to reduce the overall size of the multiyear facility by $500 million to $3.0 billion. Together with our $1.5 billion 364-day facility, we have $4.5 billion of borrowing capacity under these facilities. Over the past 2 years, we have proactively reduced Enterprise's bank credit commitments by a total of $1.5 billion or 25%. This has principally been in response to our lower level of expected capital expenditures while also trying to be a responsible client to our bank, many of whom have been under investor pressure to reduce capital commitments to the traditional energy industry. Our total debt principal outstanding was $29.8 billion as of September 30, 2021. Assuming the first call date or the final maturity date for our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio is 16.8 years and 20.9 years, respectively. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.4%. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $6.7 billion at September 30, 2021, including available -- which includes availability under our bank credit facilities and approximately $2.2 billion of unrestricted cash on hand. This amount of cash on hand, while elevated by historical standards is primarily due to having already completed our refinancing and having cash available to retire $1.4 billion of senior notes in the first quarter of next year. It also provides us additional flexibility to respond to market opportunities. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2021 was $2 billion and $8.3 billion for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021. Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.2x after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of the hybrid debt securities and reduced by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand. With that, Randy, we can open it up for questions. Okay. Shneur, I appreciate the question this morning. Here -- as we stated in prepared remarks, I think our -- when we think about allocation of capital, it's all-of-the-above approach. We have been deliberate on buybacks. And some of that is because of the legislative and regulatory uncertainty. And we -- as far as -- looking out, we're still working, you may see clarity in Washington, D.C, we don't. And I think we'll get -- will come in and get better clarity over the next few months. On the buyback activity that you mentioned from, I guess, you were referring to Magellan and MPLX, I think we need to give a little bit more time to see market reaction to that. There were a couple of research notes that we saw was -- where -- what was it -- they -- during the time period that they did buybacks that Magellan actually underperformed in that August and September period during the point in time when they actually did buybacks. And then since the time they announced all those buybacks, they had pretty much performed in line with others. So I think -- I don't think we're ready to make a knee-jerk reaction to their performance or the outperformance as a result of the buyback. I would also note that if we go back and look at several years, we're allocating a good bit of cash. In fact, we're one of the highest in paying out returning capital to our investors. And again, that's principally through distributions. Magellan has come in. I'll note, Magellan has come in, in the last year and really increase their payout ratio, but a lot of that has been as a result of proceeds from asset sales that they've been returning to investors, which makes sense. We -- but if you've noticed, we just not had much in the way of proceeds to asset sales. So we'll be coming in. We're going through our 2020 budget cycle. We'll come in and announce what our plans are for distribution increase next year in January. I would note that 2021 marks our 23rd year of distribution growth. I don't think any other midstream company can say that. And so it's our practice to return capital to investors and that includes both distributions and buybacks. And -- but we'll come in and we need to go through our budget cycle to come in and provide any more clarity on that. Right. Yes, Shneur, on that, not anything has dropped off the table as far as projects under development that really that we've been referring to the first 9 months of this year. It's more just from a standpoint of maybe timing of when some of those capital expenditures would hit in 2022. Shneur, as we sit here today on November 2, our best estimate for growth CapEx in 2022 is $1 billion to $1.5 billion. That will be subject to change as we get into \u2013 as things develop. Yes, Jeremy, again, you guys in New York must have a better visibility to D.C. than what we see. Because I mean, from what we've seen, the Build Back Better plan is still a great deal of plugs and statements that have come out of the Senate, especially Senate Finance Committee, there -- it sounds like they are still pursuing some proposals there. So I think everything is really still in very much in a state of plug. So from the standpoint of first in Senate Finance Committee, you've got -- where they were looking to eliminate oil and gas tax preference items, which again includes the qualified earnings for MLPs attributable to fossil fuels. The counter to that is on -- out of the house ways and means where you have -- they do not have the provision to eliminate the oil and gas tax preference items, which, again, are intangible drilling costs, cost depletion and MLPs. And in fact, they actually expand the qualified business activities for MLPs to pick up some renewable activities. And you've got some saying that the legislation is going to go from the House to the Senate but then we're hearing that also in the Senate that they want to start in the Senate and move to the House. So again, you guys and on the East Coast might have better visibility, but that's sort of the last thing we see. As far as on the 45Q credits, it is encouraging that they are looking to come in and increase the amount of credits, I think, in order to come in and get carbon sequestration, whether it's sequestration or whether it's through EOR, I think the credits do need to be higher. It's also encouraging to see a direct pay be included in that as well. But I think we -- right now, anything we would comment on would really just be pure speculation based on where the legislation is currently. Yes, Jeremy, we're -- from a business standpoint, we're putting up good numbers. I would go back and we think we're doing our part as far as returns on capital, the cash flow that we're generating, the performance that we're recording throughout business cycles. As I said on the last call, when we come back in and look at probably our highest correlation is to the S&P energy sector. And I think that's the comp we're -- that's the comp that we track most closely. As far as coming in and comparing to various midstream companies, hard to say. Every dog has its today. And we're going to continue to execute on what we're doing well. And our allocation of capital strategy is going to be all of the above. Yes. And Keith, that's just not one chunky project. That's several projects. Keith, I think our focus would really be more on regular way increasing the base distribution, and then we'll see what we do on buybacks. And the buybacks, obviously, all depend on opportunistic buybacks, market conditions and also business opportunities at the time. Yes. And Ed going to, I guess, what is now your third question. On inflation, I want to say over 90% of our revenues have some sort of escalation mechanism in there, which are benchmarked to various indices. So we feel like we have a pretty good protection from inflation. I think Graham and his team have done a great job on our capital projects. As far as on long lead items, we've really been in pretty good shape as far as not seeing cost creep on those projects. As far as how we think about the distribution, we said -- really what we're trying to achieve is trying to keep to, what is it, purchase power parity. And so we would like to come in. And with the increased inflation, have an increase in the distribution growth rate compared to what you've seen over the last 3 or 4 years. And really, if I could use this just in terms of that, and this might get back to Jeremy's question of as far as recognition of the progress we've made and not showing up in the unit price. Some of it may be, what have you done for me lately? And we came in and we shifted our posture in 2017 to come in and be able to finance the business better rather than coming in and relying on both the debt and equity capital markets, I think we were the first mover in coming in and self-financing the business. First, it was providing our own sources of equity capital. And this year, our cash flow from operations is going to cover all of our CapEx. So I think we made that shift. And to a degree, it may come down to a long-term view and the -- and maybe because the feedback that we get from our long-term investors, they are quite pleased with what we've been doing. And it -- versus short term. And I think a good bit of the liquidity in the stock market these days is high velocity, short-term-oriented money, and which may not align with how we've been allocating capital over the last couple of years. But we think the way that we're progressing here is best for long term -- best for the long-term financial health of the partnership. We've been -- I go back. During this time period, you had a lot of MLPs, 150-plus, come in and cut distributions, and we did not. So as a result, they actually decreased the amount of capital they returned to their partners over the last 3 or 4 years, while we continue to increase ours. But now we're at a position of what have you done for me lately. You've got some people that might have a little bit more [indiscernible] in short-term gains that they can do because they cut their distribution so deeply. So again, we're running a long race here. We're mindful of returning capital. Again, we're going to come in and do the all-of-the-above approach. And -- but that's sort of a follow-up on Jeremy's questions without charging you an extra question, Jeremy."

            "name": "Brent Secrest",
            "content": "Jean Ann, this is Brent. There's volumes in the Rockies that continue to decline. We started to see a little bit of rig activity up there, but for most part, volumes are declining. Also the fee structure up there has declined in the third quarter. In terms of the Permian, we offered some incentive rates in the short term on transportation to help entice volumes. And then, Tug, I'm looking at you on impacts from the hurricane, I don't think we had any big impacts from the hurricane as it relates to MAPL. Okay. I think going forward, Jean Ann, you're going to see those volumes increase and those margins get better. That's it. At the end of the day, if we can cover our costs and make some money, that's what we're going to do. But ultimately, a lot of these processing plants in the Permian, it's a very efficient market, and we just have to compete harder. I think in terms -- I'll talk -- this is Brent. In terms of the margins on NGLs, it's more a function of contango storage place that we had in the past. And in terms of the hedging aspect, Justin? I think in terms of what we see going forward, so you're accurate in terms of the rejection that was going on within our system. In terms of going forward, we're going to have to watch to see how fast producers get back. But I think ultimately, it comes a point in time, and we'll see when it happens where the demand of the petrochemical sector is going to outstrip supply. So we'll see how far away ethane has to be to get recovered from places that aren't nearly as close to the Gulf Coast as the Permian or the Eagle Ford or Haynesville or some areas like that. I think that answers your question. I think there's -- Rockies volumes, ATEX to some extent. There's not a whole lot of capacity left on there, but we do have some. And then ultimately, I think the bulk of the volume could come from the Permian, the stuff that's being [reshifted] up there currently. Look, to me, what's going on is something that we have preached for a long time about Houston being a market and Corpus being destination as some people get tired of hearing that, but I don't think in terms of the export business, they're one. I think it's just a function of where the pipelines end up and what they have to do. Ultimately, the value of the barrel is worth more domestically than it is across the water. So that's what you're seeing going on in Houston which -- frankly, we've got customers that have take-or-pay contracts and ultimately, what their netback is, is quite a bit higher domestically across our system in the Gulf Coast. Where we want to be long term is going across the VLCC dock. And ultimately, over time, we think that SPOT can pull the barrels away that want to go to the export markets."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Randy Burkhalter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, and welcome everyone to the Enterprise Products Partners\u2019 conference call to discuss second quarter 2021 earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise\u2019s General Partner, Jim Teague, and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise\u2019s management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Teague: Thank you, Randy. Our businesses continued to perform extremely well during the second quarter. We reported over $2 billion of EBITDA for the second quarter. Our distributable cash flow was 1.6 times coverage. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $2 billion was more than fully funded both our CapEx and our distributions. So as we sit halfway through the year, our distributable cash flow totaled $3.3 billion, providing $1.35 billion in retained cash. Second quarter results reflect the ongoing recovery in demand for hydrocarbons as the global economy continues to reopen some COVID lockdowns. Our liquids pipelines transported 6.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter. Our natural gas pipelines transported 4.2 billion BTUs a day for the second quarter that equals 2019 volumes. Summing it all up in crude oil equivalent, we transported 10.2 million barrels a day. Our fractionation volumes remained strong at or near record of 1.2 million barrels a day. Our propylene production for the second quarter of 2021 was a record 113,000 barrels a day, and liquid volumes handled by our marine terminals for the second quarter were 1.6 million barrels a day, which continues to lag pre-pandemic first quarter 2020 performance of 2 million barrels a day, primarily due to the weakness in crude oil exports. Really, this would be expected as strong prices, backward-dated markets and lower inventories at Cushing are signaling that volume needs to stay at home at least for now. In short, it shows that markets worked. This time last year, we were slipping deeper into the pandemic. It looked and felt like a black hole to some. But by this time last year, we had already returned to our headquarters office in what was virtually an empty Downtown Houston. We set protocols. We started wearing masks before they were mandated. We put plexiglass around our cubicles. We insisted on keeping our distance. And we had hand sanitizers all over the building. But I really think it was a competitive advantage being back, because we worked as a team, we\u2019ve moved products for our customers and our producers. We were buying and selling. We were arb [ph] in the system and collecting on steep contango in about every product we touched. We were determined in the middle of the pandemic to make money, not make excuses. If fast forward to today and the environment and sentiment are completely different. In the second quarter, crude averaged $28 a barrel, and as we all know, traded severely negative on April 20, 2020. Almost overnight, rig counts dropped from 800 to less than 250, producers shut in significant amounts of production and the Texas Railroad Commission held an own land hearing on mandatory proration that was attended by 35,000 people worldwide. I gave testimony to this hearing, and I was very straightforward and probably wouldn\u2019t have been as much so had I known we had 35,000 people listening. Today, WTS sits at $72. Natural gas has more than doubled from $1.75 to around $4. Rig counts have returned to 500 and growing. Producers are self-financing their capital, paying down debt, and returning funds to their shareholders. Just to give you an idea for a couple of key products. We won\u2019t go through all of them. This time last year, ethane was selling at $0.18 a gallon. Today, it\u2019s $0.33. Propane moved from $0.35. Today, it\u2019s what, $1.09, Brent. Eagle Ford Natural Gas prices up though, our gross processing spreads in the Permian, in particular, have gone from around $0.22 to $0.50 a gallon, responding to significantly increasing demand. Wholesale gasoline has moved from $0.75 to $2. It was as low as $0.50 in March of last year. And refining utilization has moved from an anemic 70% at the low to over 90%. Crude and product inventories have gone from a hard to imagine 3.6 billion barrels, at least 600 million barrels of overstocked to below normal levels of 2.8 billion and continuing to fall. The economies are recovering and demand for virtually everything is increasing worldwide, pressuring supply chains. Our cash flow \u2013 while our cash flows are markedly different largely because of the movement in all commodities from steep contango into backwardation. Our businesses and our employees prove time and time again that they will perform regardless of the environment, are today in what feels like something like hyper-growth. While a press release has a lot of details or bullets this way. During last year\u2019s collapse, we leaned hard on our marketing teams. And we said at the time, our storage was worth its weight in gold as we took advantage of steep contango arb in the system, coupled with a significant cost cutting by our operations. This year, with prices and volumes up considerably, our assets are who is leading the way with significant increases in volume for gathering and processing, pipeline transportation and exports, and what I\u2019ll generate is described as fairly steady. Moving to an update on capital. We expect our growth capital for 2021 to be $1.7 billion. We haven\u2019t changed, I don\u2019t think, Randy. For the rest of 2021, we continue to be on schedule to complete our Acadian gas system to Giles, the expansion of our ethylene and propylene pipeline systems, and the construction of our natural gasoline hydrotreater. Our growth CapEx in 2022 and 2023 projects currently sanctioned is $800 million and $400 million respectively. But we expect these to increase as some of the projects under developer \u2013 development are sanctioned. The long-dated capital is largely around our PDH 2. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the market fundamentals and momentum that we see in our petrochemicals business. The reopening of global economies has caused a surge in demand for propylene due to high demand from durables, which has caused the refinery grade to polymer-grade spread to widen from $0.15 a pound historically to $0.40 a pound. Our petrochemicals and refined products segment contributed five out of the total six financial and operational records. The strong performance of our petrochemicals business was led by our propylene segment, which offset lower results from our octane enhancement due to a planned turnaround. Our Mont Belvieu propylene splitters achieved record throughput of 98% of nameplate, with strong margins, and our PDH plant operated at an average of 112% of nameplate following the planned maintenance in the first quarter. Finally, we recently closed on a transaction acquiring the ethylene storage business from NOVA. This transaction, although it didn\u2019t take a lot of cash is meaningful in that it is yet another milestone and the development of our petrochemical hubs, which is a key in furthering our petrochemical growth strategy. We feel very good about our strong position and our momentum in the midstream petrochemical space. We\u2019re pleased with how our assets and our people performed again last quarter. We have been outspoken about why we have been bullish on prices for well over a year, and have been preparing accordingly. The global inventory excess is that came with the global pandemic for the most part been exhausted. And it\u2019s nice to see both supply and demand participating in what we believe will be a very strong extended recovery cycle. We expect continued upside in demand, both in the U.S. and globally, and appropriate production increases from the healthy U.S. E&P industry. With that, Randy?\nRandy Fowler: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. First, I\u2019ll hit some of the income segment items. Net income attributable to common unitholders for the second quarter of 2021 was $1.1 billion or $0.50 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1 billion or $0.47 per common unit for the second quarter of 2020. Net income was reduced by non-cash impairment charges of $0.01 per fully diluted unit, both for the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flows from operations increased to $2 billion for the second quarter, compared to $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2020. The swing in cash provided by or used for working capital accounts between the two quarters explains $731 million or 90% of the increase. So again, changes in working capital accounts. Free cash flow for the 12 months ended June 30, 2021. And again, we define that as cash flow from operations less investing activities, less distributions paid out to non-controlling interest in our joint venture projects, was $4.2 billion, compared to $2.7 billion for the comparable trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2020. We declared a distribution of $0.45 per common unit with respect to the second quarter of 2021. That will be paid on August 12. This distribution represents a 1.1% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020. EPD\u2019s distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined $38 million or approximately $1.6 million EPD common units in the open market during the second quarter. Our payout ratio, which we define as \u2013 some of our cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from operations over the trailing 12 months was 60% as of June 30, 2021. Compared to the latest available data, which is 12 months ending March 31, 2021, for our non-peer midstream C-corps and MLPs, Enterprise had one of the highest payout percentages. In the near term, while we wait for better visibility on federal regulatory and tax policies as it pertains to the energy industry as we assess the potential opportunities and related capital requirements for energy evolution projects, we are continuing to make financial flexibility our priority at the margin. However, we do plan to opportunistically buyback common units in the second half of this year. The amount of the buyback would probably be comparable to the $200 million we purchased in 2020. Turning to capitalization, our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $28.8 billion as of June 30. Assuming the first call date or the final maturity date for our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio was 16.5 years and 20.8 years, respectively. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 was $2 billion and $8.4 billion for the 12 months ended. Our consolidated leverage was 3.24 times after adjusting debt for the partial equity content attributed to the hybrid debt securities, and further reduced by any unrestricted cash. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $5.4 billion at June 30, including availability under our existing credit facilities, and approximately $400 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Finally, we expect to publish our annual sustainability report update, which is intended to supplement our 2019-2020 sustainability report next Monday on August 2. The report will be available on our website. We hope you have an opportunity to read it, and we look forward to publishing our next complete report in the summer of 2022. With that, Randy, I think we\u2019re ready for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay. Thank you, Randy. Shannon, we\u2019re ready to take questions from our participants.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nRandy Fowler: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to follow-up on the energy evolution initiatives there as it relates to carbon capture, and just wondering, if you might be able to provide a little bit more detail, I guess, on what you see as possible there? Is this something kind of in the Ship Channel itself, a hub concept, do you see that as something that is possible at some point in the future? And if so, where do you think the carbon could be stored? Do you think it\u2019s more of an onshore or offshore solution?\nRandy Fowler: I guess it could be both. We\u2019re looking at what we think are some low-hanging fruit. And then we\u2019re looking along with a major chemical company and major oil company as to what we could do beyond that. And you can make a case to sequester it offshore, but you\u2019ve got depleted reservoirs in the Permian, Tony, and so I mean we\u2019re still in an infancy stage, but we\u2019re beginning to see that there might be some low-hanging fruit that we can take advantage of.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense. I was just curious if poor \u2013 issues onshore kind of influenced the decision onshore versus offshore. But just also guess, I guess, what type of time line do you think that this could be really materialized over? It seems like we\u2019re really in the infancy here. If the Texas Railroad Commission gets kind of primacy on the Class VI wells, that could really change things a bit here. And if we get more federal legislation within the 45Q to 85, that could really change things here. But curious as far as what you think the time line is for things coming together here?\nJim Teague: Well, it\u2019s not immediate for sure. Tony, you can add this?\nTony Chovanec: Given the amount of regulation that\u2019s in front of us, anything short of three years would surprise me. Angie, do you feel any different?\nAngie Murray: No. I think that\u2019s about right on timing.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions about the quarter. Your NGL pipeline gross margin was down kind of 8% to 10% from its usual run rate. The news release referenced lower grades and volumes on Dixie and Maple also some downtime, but it wasn\u2019t clear to me how much was one-off and how much is kind of ongoing due to lower rates? Can you expand on that?\nRandy Fowler: It\u2019s a \u2013 Dixie was impact. We had a hydro test, so that would be, I\u2019ll call that a one-off.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. Because for the quarter, I guess, that segment was kind of 555 and it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve been in that low a couple of years. So just trying to figure out if that should be my new norm, plus some for the hydro test.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. And, Jean Ann, this is Randy. I think there were also some we\u2019ve got an integrated system. So to the extent we have NGL fracs down as well, I think we may have had some downtime over on Norco. But that could also impact the volumes moving across South Louisiana system, too. So there may be some ripple effects in that as well.\nJim Teague: Yes. I think [indiscernible] probably, I believe, was down.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then my other question is that the NGL prices year-to-date have obviously been very strong, but it hasn\u2019t seemed to really hit your processing gross margin. Can you kind of just talk about why that is because gas price has also been strong or you hedged or something else?\nBrent Secrest: I guess in terms of NGLs, Jean Ann, this is Brent. We have some key exposure, but it\u2019s probably not as much as some of our peers. So last year, I don\u2019t think in terms of when prices were very low, it wasn\u2019t probably nearly as impactful to us as it was to others. In the same vein when prices have been higher, we probably don\u2019t benefit as much as others. We do benefit, obviously. And I think the benefit that we have is more of a delayed effect in terms of what we see on volumes. And then ultimately, kind of what drives our business is it\u2019s not just as high prices, it\u2019s that gas to crude ratio where we see benefits in other parts of our business.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. And, Jean Ann, one other impact may be out there as well is at the processing plant, we elect to extract ethane. And we may be working on variable economics as far as extracting that ethane, which would not be \u2013 the benefit would not be reflected at the processing plants. If anything, it would be a cost associated with that as the processing plants, and you get benefit on your downstream assets.\nJean Ann Salisbury: That actually makes sense. Cool. That\u2019s all for me. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I appreciated the commentary in the prepared remarks today about returning capital to unitholders, including the $200 million of buybacks for this year. Randy, you spent a bit of time on today kind of highlighting the 60% payout ratio, kind of on a trailing 12-month basis for CFFO, which does include buybacks. Kind of wondering as you feel more comfortable with policy outlook and so forth, whether we could be thinking about 60% is kind of a signpost of where you\u2019d ideally like to pay out to kind of shakeout with buybacks being a portion of it for not just 2021 but for like 2022 and beyond? Just kind of curious how you\u2019re thinking about that?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Shneur, I have to go back in. I know we\u2019ve got a slide in the deck \u2013 in our investor deck that shows over time what our percent payout has been as a percentage of cash flow from operations. And some of that\u2019s impacted by changes of cash used or provided by working capital accounts. So it will move around depending on how much money we have tied up in working capital. But typically, I mean, if you go back and look over time, I want to say that I\u2019m going off memory, that has probably ranged from 55% to 65%. So, I think that\u2019s a range. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to come in and get precise dialed into the percentage that almost be like a tail wagging the dog. I think some of it is more of what\u2019s going on in the business, what kind of cash flows are we seeing being thrown off. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get as precise as 60% or 61% or 62%, but it would be more in a range.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay. That makes sense. Perfect. Appreciate that. And then sort of a follow-up to how you\u2019re thinking about CapEx for 2022. I understand that you have $100 million of sanctioned projects. In addition to spot, are there any larger-scale projects that you\u2019re evaluating, whether it\u2019s on energy evolution or kind of on the base business that\u2019s expensed today? But are there any projects that you\u2019re evaluating or even in the permitting process that could move the number by more than $500 million for next year? Just kind of curious, where you are in terms of what you\u2019re evaluating right now?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. I\u2019ll kick off with this, Shneur, and then see if Jim wants to add. We had mentioned really going back to, I think, our January call that we were working on a few projects that we \u2013 just for commercial sensitivity, we weren\u2019t going to provide a lot of detail, and that\u2019s still where we are today, that I can\u2019t provide a lot of detail. But those \u2013 we\u2019ll see \u2013 could it come in and add to 2022? Yes, it could. It could be in the $500 million incremental area. But I go back to what Jim said in the call back in these calls come around so quick in April, I guess, where he said, if you think longer term, something in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion run rate could be in the near term, what you could see our growth CapEx. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d get to that number for next year. But I think that\u2019s a good go above.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay. So, just to re-clarify, so 1.5% to 2% is kind of the range, but hard to kind of hit the top of the range next year?\nJim Teague: I hate to underestimate our guess. But, yes, we \u2013 that\u2019s how we feel.\nRandy Fowler: We\u2019d have to hurry, Jim.\nShneur Gershuni: Okay, that makes perfect sense. Really appreciate the color, and have a great day, guys.\nJim Teague: Thank you.\nRandy Fowler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTristan Richardson: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just remarking on the petchem business, strong results there, particularly on the propylene and PDH side. Clearly, the past few quarters have had some turnarounds and downtime. But just looking at this quarter, based on what you\u2019re seeing from a spread perspective, is this a good general run rate for gross margin when the spread is available to you and facilities are online and highly utilized?\nJim Teague: In the near term, I think we\u2019re going to be hanging in here with this kind of results. Chris?\nChris D\u2019Anna: Yes, Jim. I agree. We should be in the same run rate with everything running and refinery utilization hanging in there?\nJim Teague: Well, I was with \u2013 I\u2019ve talked to a couple of CEOs from petrochemical companies. And what they both said to me is everyone and pull-out and they can\u2019t catch up. So, we kind of like that business and probably see us do more things in it.\nTristan Richardson: That\u2019s great. And then I think you talked \u2013 historically, you guys have talked about in any given year there might be $500 million to $800 million of spread opportunities. And I think as of the most recent quarter, kind of talked about potentially 2021 being north of $600 million. Curious if that\u2019s still north of $600 million is a comfortable figure or how we should think about, how that\u2019s changed over the past quarter?\nJim Teague: North of $600 million will be conservative.\nTristan Richardson: Appreciate it. Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Good morning. I first, just wanted to clarify the demand response items. So the total benefit, it looks like for Q2 was the $66 million in the release, and that\u2019s across the fractionation and that seaway. And then also, I just want to confirm that\u2019s incremental to the $250 million year gain you talked about last quarter. Right?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Keith. So, I think what we\u2019re \u2013 probably in total, we\u2019re looking at about $300 million in total. And then in the second quarter, yes, the benefit was probably around $70 million. And some of the reasons why you didn\u2019t see that hit until the second quarter is frankly, we were waiting on clarity from the State of Texas as far as what the definitive settlement was going to be around ERCOT and around the LRS program.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. Okay, one follow-up question on capital allocation. So just looking back, you raised the distribution slightly in Q4 last year. Should we expect similar timing for distribution growth announcements? And I guess, how are you thinking about distribution growth generally into next year versus buybacks as part of the capital return story?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Keith, I think the Board comes in. I mean, we take a look at the distribution every quarter. But here the last two or three years, we\u2019ve done it where we\u2019ve come in and really announced the increase in January for the next year. And I think we would probably stick to that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s cast in stone. If you \u2013 as far as the whole thing on distributions versus buybacks, we\u2019re an MLP. The most tax-efficient way to return capital and cash to your partners is through distributions. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. I think we\u2019ve got \u2013 this is the 23 year in a row that we\u2019ve increased our cash distribution. And I \u2013 there\u2019s not another midstream company out there that I know of that can say that. So distributions are really our first go-to. As far as on the buyback side, I think as options professor talked one time, it depends. It depends on what your level of CapEx is, and I think we need to see not only the level of CapEx, we just need to get some better visibility on government policy because right now, there\u2019s just a lot of question marks. I thought we would have known something by now, but it looks like that\u2019s dragging out. But I think a lot of things go into the calculus of coming in and doing buybacks. But I think we\u2019ve demonstrated our willingness to come in and do buybacks, but we\u2019re just going to be deliberate in the way that we lag into it.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Your line is open.\nChristine Cho: Thank you. So maybe if I could start with the LPG market. There\u2019s been market reports that you guys have been buying back cargos in recent weeks. Is this just marketing \u2013 your marketing subsidiary preparing for what could potentially be a short propane market in the coming months? It seems like the amount that you\u2019ve been buying back is more than what your PDH facility could take, but any kind of color on what you guys are thinking there would be helpful?\nJim Teague: Hey, Chris. I\u2019ll start and give it to Brent. We bought it back because the fees were too cheap. We could make more money doing something else with the propane. Brent?\nBrent Secrest: That\u2019s it. I mean, at the end of the day, we look at every molecule and what the value of it is to Enterprise versus what we get across the dock, and what we achieved across the dock isn\u2019t worth what we have, keeping it in the system.\nChristine Cho: Now could \u2013 is some of this potentially going into storage for like later, I mean, the curve is backward dated, so it just didn\u2019t seem like you would be able to hedge things out.\nBrent Secrest: Yes. I would not look at it as a storage play.\nChristine Cho: Okay. And then could you give an update around spot, just where the regulatory process is? What the next milestones are, especially if it\u2019s to hit 2022 CapEx? And just given expectations for overall U.S. production growth isn\u2019t what it used to be. Can you just go over your thoughts on why SPOT is necessary? And would you still need your crude export facilities along the gulf? Or would you look to potentially repurpose those assets for something else?\nJim Teague: Yes. I think one of the things. We still believe SPOT is something \u2013 that we that is needed to serve. It\u2019s kind of a magnet to pull things through your pipeline system. But we\u2019ve got a strong anchor, and I think we\u2019ve got some interest from others. We expect the final EIS to come out. I think it\u2019s ready, by the Coast Guard. And the last time we heard from Marriott is to expect a permit in the fourth quarter. But yes, we feel like it\u2019s a project. Now, we can build this project in phases and that\u2019s what we intend to do.\nChristine Cho: And would you still keep your existing crude facilities along the Gulf?\nJim Teague: I\u2019m sorry, Christine, you did ask that. I think we need to \u2013 we\u2019re looking at a need to expand our LPG capability out of the Ship Channel. So that\u2019s what \u2013 is Bob Sanders in here? Let me talk to him \u2013 we\u2019re looking at \u2013 we\u2019ve got some expansion projects on our LPG facility on the ship channel.\nBrent Secrest: We have a lot of long-term contracts that are on enterprise assets. And so if we have joint venture partners on the VLCC terminal, there\u2019s still a need for what we have existing, and then it would be more of an optimization as it relates to the joint venture partners. But between petchem and NGLs, there\u2019s ways to use those docks\u2019 as crude oil.\nChristine Cho: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A little bit of a theoretical one. How do you think \u2013 when you think about capital allocation versus CapEx, whether that capital allocation is deleveraging, buybacks or even just normal course distribution growth or special distribution payouts? How do you think about what your cost of capital is? And what is the return on new project has to hit to make it kind of a more valuable use of cash relative to some of the other alternatives?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Michael, I\u2019m glad you asked that, because I was actually incomplete with my answer earlier. Because that\u2019s one of the things that factors in there is when we come in and look at our CapEx and if you come in and you look at the buyback, when you \u2013 we look at what our return on capital is on the project, but we also look at what the downstream benefits are from a project that, again, we run a value chain system. So if we add a project, it has the ability to come in and add incremental volumes and incremental margin to other parts of our system. So that adds on to the project economics. And we look at that holistic return. And also it adds on \u2013 it increases EBITDA as well. Compared to a buyback, I mean, I think, as I look this morning, I think we were yielding, I don\u2019t know, 7%, 7.5%, our coverage is about 1.5 times. So, I think that rough math is probably between 11% and 12% cash yield, if you think about it from \u2013 if I go back to distributable cash flow because, again, that\u2019s subtracting out maintenance CapEx. So that\u2019s the bogey that we look at on the buyback side. And those are the two of the returns that we look at just from a return threshold.\nJim Teague: Does that cover it all for you?\nMichael Lapides: Yes. That helps a ton. And just trying to think about special distributions. Are there any reasons why special distributions would ever be off the table?\nRandy Fowler: Michael, we\u2019ve not really contemplated them in the past. I mean, a little bit, I\u2019d turn that question on you. It seems like a lot of what I read in sell-side reports really dismisses the effectiveness of special distributions. If you\u2019re \u2013 and I understand not being able to come in \u2013 the inability for the equity markets to capitalize a special distribution into the unit price, but frankly, our guys ran some correlation analysis the other day, and it\u2019s crazy to me that when you come back in and you pick the period, three years, five years, 10 years, we actually have \u2013 our unit price has an inverse correlation to cash flow per unit. It has an inverse correlation to EBITDA. And really, the only correlation, the highest correlation that it has is to the price of the XLE, the S&P energy sector. So, I scratch my head anyway that the cash that we generate, our unit price didn\u2019t correlated to the cash that we generate anyway. So, I\u2019m \u2013 we\u2019re in a little bit of a quandary. So, I don\u2019t know if the special distribution would be good or bad, because I don\u2019t know what our unit price correlates to anymore. But I go back to what I said earlier, the most efficient, tax-efficient way to get cash and return capital to limited partners is through distributions.\nMichael Lapides: Understood. Cool. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGabe Moreen: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Recently, there was \u2013 I guess one of your peers announced a JV transaction with a private equity-backed gathering system. Just wondering if something like that, is it interest potentially maybe circumvent, some of I think beyond antitrust issues you\u2019ve raised in the past. Just curious what your thoughts on that?\nJim Teague: Our thoughts on that transaction?\nGabe Moreen: Yes. Specifically, if it might make sense in either the Permian or in over piped areas like the Eagle Ford, for example, and a way to consolidate the sector when private equity owns quite a bit of assets out there?\nJim Teague: I guess we never say never. And, Randy, we\u2019re kicking tires all the time. As to that, I don\u2019t know that we would be interested in the joint venture with the private equity. I\u2019d tell you, we\u2019re spending a lot of time right now looking at our pipeline system and trying to determine what are the opportunities to repurpose. But, I mean, we look at everything, but I can\u2019t see us doing a joint venture with a private equity. Can you, Brent? Do you\u2026\nBrent Secrest: I mean, to your comment never say never, but there\u2019s a lot of opportunities that we look at, and we\u2019ll see what comes of it.\nGabe Moreen: Got it. And then maybe if I can just follow-up and ask specifically as it pertains to Randy\u2019s comments about kind of waiting for definitive stuff out of D.C. on policy. What should we be looking for, is it really just tax rates? Are you looking kind of for the, I guess, the federal permitting, the infrastructure build, all of the above? I\u2019m just specifically wondering kind of what \u2013 of those things, what\u2019s most prominent, I guess, in your mind?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Gabe. I think it\u2019s all of the above. And I mean some of it, even you could come in and say it\u2019s even we\u2019re \u2013 I think the energy industry is in a little bit of a conundrum.\nJim Teague: Randy, you talk about the focus on supply and not on demand. You do good on that.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Because if you come in by last count, they are like 194 countries in the EU that have signed on to the Paris account. And part of that is coming in and trying to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. But none of those countries have enacted any policies addressed to oil and gas demand. And it seems like the policies that are being driven are more on supply. And more really, I think in the U.S., what we\u2019ve seen thus far this year is really on domestic supply and but not anything on demand. And you come back in, I think that what we\u2019ve heard out of you pick it IEA, EIA is the expectations, we\u2019re going to be back to 100 million barrels a day of crude demand by the end of the year. And looking for that demand to grow, I think, again, no matter what EIA or IEA that you look at, looking for crude oil demand to grow for the rest of the decade, at least. And \u2013 but really, the only policies out there domestically are on supply constraints. And so where that leads us is \u2013 and I think you\u2019ve seen it to a degree. You\u2019re going to end up with higher crude oil prices, higher motor gasoline prices across the board, which will be inflationary, but we\u2019re at a little bit of a conundrum on energy policy in the country as well. The other thing that \u2013 well, because I mean in the most recent example is, I guess, with the \u2013 some of this has been going on since January. Domestically, we\u2019ve come in and we were putting a freeze on permits on federal lands, but we\u2019re asking OPEC Plus to come in and produce more oil so oil prices won\u2019t go up, and so again, just a head-scratcher. And \u2013 but I think when you come in and you look, the world OPEC Plus countries, they have the capacity to produce more oil and they have the capacity to come in and respond to demand. Again, I think it\u2019s going to be at a higher price. And you\u2019ve seen recently whether it\u2019s the Saudi Oil Minister or the Prime Minister of Norway, and I believe Norway is part of the climate agreement. They\u2019ve both said that they\u2019re going to drill and withdraw every last barrel of oil that they have in the ground. So, we are \u2013 so gave up, I think there\u2019s just a lot of unknowns out there. We\u2019re early on in this energy evolution. We think we\u2019ve got a role to play. In fact, when we look at midstream companies, on this whole energy evolution in handling carbon sequestration and hydrogen, we may be one of the early on that we can respond quicker than a lot of companies that are trying to do this from the get-go because we already have pipes everywhere, and we know geology. So again, we just need some more clarity, whether it\u2019s tax policy, regulatory policy, energy policy. And then frankly, I think the other thing that will be out there is just what we\u2019re seeing, there\u2019s so much changes going on at the FTC as well. But I mean, that\u2019s more of a broad comment. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in energy or in tech as far as what\u2019s coming on into the \u2013 I mean, how the government in that regard too. So, I didn\u2019t mean to get on my soapbox to you, but just again, painting on a little bit more clarity. And \u2013 but that\u2019s not \u2013 but we will come in and act on opportunities as we see them come forward.\nGabe Moreen: Got it. Well, thank you. Appreciate all those thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I\u2019m currently showing no further questions at this time.\nJim Teague: Okay. Thank you, Shannon. With that, we will conclude the call today.

            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Our businesses continued to perform extremely well during the second quarter. We reported over $2 billion of EBITDA for the second quarter. Our distributable cash flow was 1.6 times coverage. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $2 billion was more than fully funded both our CapEx and our distributions. So as we sit halfway through the year, our distributable cash flow totaled $3.3 billion, providing $1.35 billion in retained cash. Second quarter results reflect the ongoing recovery in demand for hydrocarbons as the global economy continues to reopen some COVID lockdowns. Our liquids pipelines transported 6.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter. Our natural gas pipelines transported 4.2 billion BTUs a day for the second quarter that equals 2019 volumes. Summing it all up in crude oil equivalent, we transported 10.2 million barrels a day. Our fractionation volumes remained strong at or near record of 1.2 million barrels a day. Our propylene production for the second quarter of 2021 was a record 113,000 barrels a day, and liquid volumes handled by our marine terminals for the second quarter were 1.6 million barrels a day, which continues to lag pre-pandemic first quarter 2020 performance of 2 million barrels a day, primarily due to the weakness in crude oil exports. Really, this would be expected as strong prices, backward-dated markets and lower inventories at Cushing are signaling that volume needs to stay at home at least for now. In short, it shows that markets worked. This time last year, we were slipping deeper into the pandemic. It looked and felt like a black hole to some. But by this time last year, we had already returned to our headquarters office in what was virtually an empty Downtown Houston. We set protocols. We started wearing masks before they were mandated. We put plexiglass around our cubicles. We insisted on keeping our distance. And we had hand sanitizers all over the building. But I really think it was a competitive advantage being back, because we worked as a team, we've moved products for our customers and our producers. We were buying and selling. We were arb [ph] in the system and collecting on steep contango in about every product we touched. We were determined in the middle of the pandemic to make money, not make excuses. If fast forward to today and the environment and sentiment are completely different. In the second quarter, crude averaged $28 a barrel, and as we all know, traded severely negative on April 20, 2020. Almost overnight, rig counts dropped from 800 to less than 250, producers shut in significant amounts of production and the Texas Railroad Commission held an own land hearing on mandatory proration that was attended by 35,000 people worldwide. I gave testimony to this hearing, and I was very straightforward and probably wouldn't have been as much so had I known we had 35,000 people listening. Today, WTS sits at $72. Natural gas has more than doubled from $1.75 to around $4. Rig counts have returned to 500 and growing. Producers are self-financing their capital, paying down debt, and returning funds to their shareholders. Just to give you an idea for a couple of key products. We won't go through all of them. This time last year, ethane was selling at $0.18 a gallon. Today, it's $0.33. Propane moved from $0.35. Today, it's what, $1.09, Brent. Eagle Ford Natural Gas prices up though, our gross processing spreads in the Permian, in particular, have gone from around $0.22 to $0.50 a gallon, responding to significantly increasing demand. Wholesale gasoline has moved from $0.75 to $2. It was as low as $0.50 in March of last year. And refining utilization has moved from an anemic 70% at the low to over 90%. Crude and product inventories have gone from a hard to imagine 3.6 billion barrels, at least 600 million barrels of overstocked to below normal levels of 2.8 billion and continuing to fall. The economies are recovering and demand for virtually everything is increasing worldwide, pressuring supply chains. Our cash flow \u2013 while our cash flows are markedly different largely because of the movement in all commodities from steep contango into backwardation. Our businesses and our employees prove time and time again that they will perform regardless of the environment, are today in what feels like something like hyper-growth. While a press release has a lot of details or bullets this way. During last year's collapse, we leaned hard on our marketing teams. And we said at the time, our storage was worth its weight in gold as we took advantage of steep contango arb in the system, coupled with a significant cost cutting by our operations. This year, with prices and volumes up considerably, our assets are who is leading the way with significant increases in volume for gathering and processing, pipeline transportation and exports, and what I'll generate is described as fairly steady. Moving to an update on capital. We expect our growth capital for 2021 to be $1.7 billion. We haven't changed, I don't think, Randy. For the rest of 2021, we continue to be on schedule to complete our Acadian gas system to Giles, the expansion of our ethylene and propylene pipeline systems, and the construction of our natural gasoline hydrotreater. Our growth CapEx in 2022 and 2023 projects currently sanctioned is $800 million and $400 million respectively. But we expect these to increase as some of the projects under developer \u2013 development are sanctioned. The long-dated capital is largely around our PDH 2. We couldn't be more pleased with the market fundamentals and momentum that we see in our petrochemicals business. The reopening of global economies has caused a surge in demand for propylene due to high demand from durables, which has caused the refinery grade to polymer-grade spread to widen from $0.15 a pound historically to $0.40 a pound. Our petrochemicals and refined products segment contributed five out of the total six financial and operational records. The strong performance of our petrochemicals business was led by our propylene segment, which offset lower results from our octane enhancement due to a planned turnaround. Our Mont Belvieu propylene splitters achieved record throughput of 98% of nameplate, with strong margins, and our PDH plant operated at an average of 112% of nameplate following the planned maintenance in the first quarter. Finally, we recently closed on a transaction acquiring the ethylene storage business from NOVA. This transaction, although it didn't take a lot of cash is meaningful in that it is yet another milestone and the development of our petrochemical hubs, which is a key in furthering our petrochemical growth strategy. We feel very good about our strong position and our momentum in the midstream petrochemical space. We're pleased with how our assets and our people performed again last quarter. We have been outspoken about why we have been bullish on prices for well over a year, and have been preparing accordingly. The global inventory excess is that came with the global pandemic for the most part been exhausted. And it's nice to see both supply and demand participating in what we believe will be a very strong extended recovery cycle. We expect continued upside in demand, both in the U.S. and globally, and appropriate production increases from the healthy U.S. E&P industry. With that, Randy? Well, it's not immediate for sure. Tony, you can add this? Yes. I think [indiscernible] probably, I believe, was down. I hate to underestimate our guess. But, yes, we \u2013 that's how we feel. Thank you. In the near term, I think we're going to be hanging in here with this kind of results. Chris? Well, I was with \u2013 I've talked to a couple of CEOs from petrochemical companies. And what they both said to me is everyone and pull-out and they can't catch up. So, we kind of like that business and probably see us do more things in it. North of $600 million will be conservative. Hey, Chris. I'll start and give it to Brent. We bought it back because the fees were too cheap. We could make more money doing something else with the propane. Brent? Yes. I think one of the things. We still believe SPOT is something \u2013 that we that is needed to serve. It's kind of a magnet to pull things through your pipeline system. But we've got a strong anchor, and I think we've got some interest from others. We expect the final EIS to come out. I think it's ready, by the Coast Guard. And the last time we heard from Marriott is to expect a permit in the fourth quarter. But yes, we feel like it's a project. Now, we can build this project in phases and that's what we intend to do. I'm sorry, Christine, you did ask that. I think we need to \u2013 we're looking at a need to expand our LPG capability out of the Ship Channel. So that's what \u2013 is Bob Sanders in here? Let me talk to him \u2013 we're looking at \u2013 we've got some expansion projects on our LPG facility on the ship channel. Does that cover it all for you? Our thoughts on that transaction? I guess we never say never. And, Randy, we're kicking tires all the time. As to that, I don't know that we would be interested in the joint venture with the private equity. I'd tell you, we're spending a lot of time right now looking at our pipeline system and trying to determine what are the opportunities to repurpose. But, I mean, we look at everything, but I can't see us doing a joint venture with a private equity. Can you, Brent? Do you... Randy, you talk about the focus on supply and not on demand. You do good on that. Okay. Thank you, Shannon. With that, we will conclude the call today. And if you wouldn't mind, Shannon, would you please give our participants the replay information. And thank you all for joining us today."

            "name": "Randy Fowler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll hit some of the income segment items. Net income attributable to common unitholders for the second quarter of 2021 was $1.1 billion or $0.50 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1 billion or $0.47 per common unit for the second quarter of 2020. Net income was reduced by non-cash impairment charges of $0.01 per fully diluted unit, both for the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flows from operations increased to $2 billion for the second quarter, compared to $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2020. The swing in cash provided by or used for working capital accounts between the two quarters explains $731 million or 90% of the increase. So again, changes in working capital accounts. Free cash flow for the 12 months ended June 30, 2021. And again, we define that as cash flow from operations less investing activities, less distributions paid out to non-controlling interest in our joint venture projects, was $4.2 billion, compared to $2.7 billion for the comparable trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2020. We declared a distribution of $0.45 per common unit with respect to the second quarter of 2021. That will be paid on August 12. This distribution represents a 1.1% increase compared to the second quarter of 2020. EPD's distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined $38 million or approximately $1.6 million EPD common units in the open market during the second quarter. Our payout ratio, which we define as \u2013 some of our cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of cash flow from operations over the trailing 12 months was 60% as of June 30, 2021. Compared to the latest available data, which is 12 months ending March 31, 2021, for our non-peer midstream C-corps and MLPs, Enterprise had one of the highest payout percentages. In the near term, while we wait for better visibility on federal regulatory and tax policies as it pertains to the energy industry as we assess the potential opportunities and related capital requirements for energy evolution projects, we are continuing to make financial flexibility our priority at the margin. However, we do plan to opportunistically buyback common units in the second half of this year. The amount of the buyback would probably be comparable to the $200 million we purchased in 2020. Turning to capitalization, our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $28.8 billion as of June 30. Assuming the first call date or the final maturity date for our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio was 16.5 years and 20.8 years, respectively. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 was $2 billion and $8.4 billion for the 12 months ended. Our consolidated leverage was 3.24 times after adjusting debt for the partial equity content attributed to the hybrid debt securities, and further reduced by any unrestricted cash. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $5.4 billion at June 30, including availability under our existing credit facilities, and approximately $400 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Finally, we expect to publish our annual sustainability report update, which is intended to supplement our 2019-2020 sustainability report next Monday on August 2. The report will be available on our website. We hope you have an opportunity to read it, and we look forward to publishing our next complete report in the summer of 2022. With that, Randy, I think we're ready for questions. Good morning. I guess it could be both. We're looking at what we think are some low-hanging fruit. And then we're looking along with a major chemical company and major oil company as to what we could do beyond that. And you can make a case to sequester it offshore, but you've got depleted reservoirs in the Permian, Tony, and so I mean we're still in an infancy stage, but we're beginning to see that there might be some low-hanging fruit that we can take advantage of. It's a \u2013 Dixie was impact. We had a hydro test, so that would be, I'll call that a one-off. Yes. And, Jean Ann, this is Randy. I think there were also some we've got an integrated system. So to the extent we have NGL fracs down as well, I think we may have had some downtime over on Norco. But that could also impact the volumes moving across South Louisiana system, too. So there may be some ripple effects in that as well. Yes. And, Jean Ann, one other impact may be out there as well is at the processing plant, we elect to extract ethane. And we may be working on variable economics as far as extracting that ethane, which would not be \u2013 the benefit would not be reflected at the processing plants. If anything, it would be a cost associated with that as the processing plants, and you get benefit on your downstream assets. Yes. Shneur, I have to go back in. I know we've got a slide in the deck \u2013 in our investor deck that shows over time what our percent payout has been as a percentage of cash flow from operations. And some of that's impacted by changes of cash used or provided by working capital accounts. So it will move around depending on how much money we have tied up in working capital. But typically, I mean, if you go back and look over time, I want to say that I'm going off memory, that has probably ranged from 55% to 65%. So, I think that's a range. I don't think we're going to come in and get precise dialed into the percentage that almost be like a tail wagging the dog. I think some of it is more of what's going on in the business, what kind of cash flows are we seeing being thrown off. So, I don't think we're going to get as precise as 60% or 61% or 62%, but it would be more in a range. Yes. I'll kick off with this, Shneur, and then see if Jim wants to add. We had mentioned really going back to, I think, our January call that we were working on a few projects that we \u2013 just for commercial sensitivity, we weren't going to provide a lot of detail, and that's still where we are today, that I can't provide a lot of detail. But those \u2013 we'll see \u2013 could it come in and add to 2022? Yes, it could. It could be in the $500 million incremental area. But I go back to what Jim said in the call back in these calls come around so quick in April, I guess, where he said, if you think longer term, something in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion run rate could be in the near term, what you could see our growth CapEx. I don't know if we'd get to that number for next year. But I think that's a good go above. We'd have to hurry, Jim. Thank you. Yes, Keith. So, I think what we're \u2013 probably in total, we're looking at about $300 million in total. And then in the second quarter, yes, the benefit was probably around $70 million. And some of the reasons why you didn't see that hit until the second quarter is frankly, we were waiting on clarity from the State of Texas as far as what the definitive settlement was going to be around ERCOT and around the LRS program. Yes. Keith, I think the Board comes in. I mean, we take a look at the distribution every quarter. But here the last two or three years, we've done it where we've come in and really announced the increase in January for the next year. And I think we would probably stick to that. I don't think that's cast in stone. If you \u2013 as far as the whole thing on distributions versus buybacks, we're an MLP. The most tax-efficient way to return capital and cash to your partners is through distributions. And that's what we've done. I think we've got \u2013 this is the 23 year in a row that we've increased our cash distribution. And I \u2013 there's not another midstream company out there that I know of that can say that. So distributions are really our first go-to. As far as on the buyback side, I think as options professor talked one time, it depends. It depends on what your level of CapEx is, and I think we need to see not only the level of CapEx, we just need to get some better visibility on government policy because right now, there's just a lot of question marks. I thought we would have known something by now, but it looks like that's dragging out. But I think a lot of things go into the calculus of coming in and doing buybacks. But I think we've demonstrated our willingness to come in and do buybacks, but we're just going to be deliberate in the way that we lag into it. Yes. Michael, I'm glad you asked that, because I was actually incomplete with my answer earlier. Because that's one of the things that factors in there is when we come in and look at our CapEx and if you come in and you look at the buyback, when you \u2013 we look at what our return on capital is on the project, but we also look at what the downstream benefits are from a project that, again, we run a value chain system. So if we add a project, it has the ability to come in and add incremental volumes and incremental margin to other parts of our system. So that adds on to the project economics. And we look at that holistic return. And also it adds on \u2013 it increases EBITDA as well. Compared to a buyback, I mean, I think, as I look this morning, I think we were yielding, I don't know, 7%, 7.5%, our coverage is about 1.5 times. So, I think that rough math is probably between 11% and 12% cash yield, if you think about it from \u2013 if I go back to distributable cash flow because, again, that's subtracting out maintenance CapEx. So that's the bogey that we look at on the buyback side. And those are the two of the returns that we look at just from a return threshold. Michael, we've not really contemplated them in the past. I mean, a little bit, I'd turn that question on you. It seems like a lot of what I read in sell-side reports really dismisses the effectiveness of special distributions. If you're \u2013 and I understand not being able to come in \u2013 the inability for the equity markets to capitalize a special distribution into the unit price, but frankly, our guys ran some correlation analysis the other day, and it's crazy to me that when you come back in and you pick the period, three years, five years, 10 years, we actually have \u2013 our unit price has an inverse correlation to cash flow per unit. It has an inverse correlation to EBITDA. And really, the only correlation, the highest correlation that it has is to the price of the XLE, the S&P energy sector. So, I scratch my head anyway that the cash that we generate, our unit price didn't correlated to the cash that we generate anyway. So, I'm \u2013 we're in a little bit of a quandary. So, I don't know if the special distribution would be good or bad, because I don't know what our unit price correlates to anymore. But I go back to what I said earlier, the most efficient, tax-efficient way to get cash and return capital to limited partners is through distributions. Yes, Gabe. I think it's all of the above. And I mean some of it, even you could come in and say it's even we're \u2013 I think the energy industry is in a little bit of a conundrum. Yes. Because if you come in by last count, they are like 194 countries in the EU that have signed on to the Paris account. And part of that is coming in and trying to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. But none of those countries have enacted any policies addressed to oil and gas demand. And it seems like the policies that are being driven are more on supply. And more really, I think in the U.S., what we've seen thus far this year is really on domestic supply and but not anything on demand. And you come back in, I think that what we've heard out of you pick it IEA, EIA is the expectations, we're going to be back to 100 million barrels a day of crude demand by the end of the year. And looking for that demand to grow, I think, again, no matter what EIA or IEA that you look at, looking for crude oil demand to grow for the rest of the decade, at least. And \u2013 but really, the only policies out there domestically are on supply constraints. And so where that leads us is \u2013 and I think you've seen it to a degree. You're going to end up with higher crude oil prices, higher motor gasoline prices across the board, which will be inflationary, but we're at a little bit of a conundrum on energy policy in the country as well. The other thing that \u2013 well, because I mean in the most recent example is, I guess, with the \u2013 some of this has been going on since January. Domestically, we've come in and we were putting a freeze on permits on federal lands, but we're asking OPEC Plus to come in and produce more oil so oil prices won't go up, and so again, just a head-scratcher. And \u2013 but I think when you come in and you look, the world OPEC Plus countries, they have the capacity to produce more oil and they have the capacity to come in and respond to demand. Again, I think it's going to be at a higher price. And you've seen recently whether it's the Saudi Oil Minister or the Prime Minister of Norway, and I believe Norway is part of the climate agreement. They've both said that they're going to drill and withdraw every last barrel of oil that they have in the ground. So, we are \u2013 so gave up, I think there's just a lot of unknowns out there. We're early on in this energy evolution. We think we've got a role to play. In fact, when we look at midstream companies, on this whole energy evolution in handling carbon sequestration and hydrogen, we may be one of the early on that we can respond quicker than a lot of companies that are trying to do this from the get-go because we already have pipes everywhere, and we know geology. So again, we just need some more clarity, whether it's tax policy, regulatory policy, energy policy. And then frankly, I think the other thing that will be out there is just what we're seeing, there's so much changes going on at the FTC as well. But I mean, that's more of a broad comment. It doesn't matter if you're in energy or in tech as far as what's coming on into the \u2013 I mean, how the government in that regard too. So, I didn't mean to get on my soapbox to you, but just again, painting on a little bit more clarity. And \u2013 but that's not \u2013 but we will come in and act on opportunities as we see them come forward."

            "content": "I guess in terms of NGLs, Jean Ann, this is Brent. We have some key exposure, but it's probably not as much as some of our peers. So last year, I don't think in terms of when prices were very low, it wasn't probably nearly as impactful to us as it was to others. In the same vein when prices have been higher, we probably don't benefit as much as others. We do benefit, obviously. And I think the benefit that we have is more of a delayed effect in terms of what we see on volumes. And then ultimately, kind of what drives our business is it's not just as high prices, it's that gas to crude ratio where we see benefits in other parts of our business. That's it. I mean, at the end of the day, we look at every molecule and what the value of it is to Enterprise versus what we get across the dock, and what we achieved across the dock isn't worth what we have, keeping it in the system. Yes. I would not look at it as a storage play. We have a lot of long-term contracts that are on enterprise assets. And so if we have joint venture partners on the VLCC terminal, there's still a need for what we have existing, and then it would be more of an optimization as it relates to the joint venture partners. But between petchem and NGLs, there's ways to use those docks' as crude oil. I mean, to your comment never say never, but there's a lot of opportunities that we look at, and we'll see what comes of it."

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Randy Burkhalter, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners\u2019 call to discuss first quarter 2021 earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise\u2019s General Partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise\u2019s management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. And so with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Teague: Thank you, Randy. Our businesses continued to perform extremely well during the first quarter. We reported $2.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA. Distributable cash flow was $1.7 billion, and 1.8 times coverage, and we retained $700 million. Randy is going to get into the numbers deeper. We couldn\u2019t be prouder of our people. Time and time again, whether they\u2019re faced with a financial crisis, over 50 inches of rain from Hurricane Harvey at Mont Belvieu, or a combination of pandemic, global price war that was immediately followed by a record Gulf Coast hurricane season, or a historic winter storm that shuts down virtually the entire state, our people prepare, adjust when needed and they execute and make things happen, and for that we are extremely grateful. Relative to the winter storm, forecasters did a great job of calling for a major event, historic event at least a week in advance. As the storm developed, every county in Texas, as you know, was under a winter storm warning. It froze in supplies across the state and affected the entire energy value chain. It impacted much of the generating capacity across the state, at one point, even some of our nuclear. In spite of what you\u2019ve heard in the press, Texas ended up counting on natural gas as wind generation dropped to near zero at the height of the storm. Our people prepared, backing our pipelines, buying extra gas to prepare for freeze-offs, scheduling our assets and staging themselves in hotels and own cots at our plants. Most of our Texas assets, including our assets at Mont Belvieu and the Ship Channel were offline at the height of the storm mostly intentionally, as we work to make BTUs available through deep rejection, bypass and plant shutdowns. We sold natural gas to electricity generators, natural gas utilities and industrial customers to assist them in meeting their needs. Our gas business, which includes pipelines, gas storage, small gas storage and gas marketing is integral to what we do in many of our other businesses, but it\u2019s nowhere near the size of, say, a Kinder Morgan or Energy Transfer. During the freeze, our natural gas team, including the commercial gas control and gas marketing and schedulers worked tirelessly. They knew to start preparing long before the temperature had dropped, then they worked around the clock for days to deal with the problems and the opportunities. And it shows in our results. As to power, our people took proactive steps to minimize our exposure to $9,000 megawatt per hour power through participation in ERCOT\u2019s LARS program, which redeploys industrial power supplies to human needs and by voluntarily shedding a significant amount of load. Today, Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast petrochemical plants and refineries have completed repairs and have increased rates, with both industries realizing some of the best margins we have ever seen. As we emerge from COVID-related lockdowns, global demand continues to improve for crude, NGLs, primary petrochemicals and refined products. Diesel demand actually exceeds pre-COVID norms in much of the world, and gasoline demand is picking up, already exceeding 2019 levels in some countries. Downtown Houston is far from fully occupied, but traffic in this city is, at times, already back to what some term as awful. For the first time in my life, I think traffic jams are beautiful. Since April 20, 2020, we have been outspoken about why we felt oil prices would go up dramatically. While economic recoveries aren\u2019t uniform, when you look at the world\u2019s largest economies, demand has moved up, and all indications are that even Europe isn\u2019t far behind. Moving on to capital. We continue to expect our growth in capital investments for 2021 to be $1.6 billion and another $440 million for sustaining capital. The rest of 2021, we continue to be on schedule to complete the expansion of our Acadian Gas system to Gillis, Louisiana, which serves LNG markets, the expansion of our ethane, ethylene and propylene pipeline systems and the construction of our natural gasoline hydrotreater. Our growth capital in 2022 and 2023 for projects currently sanctioned is $800 million and $400 million, respectively. Longer-dated capital commitments are largely around our PDH 2 plant expected online in 2023. We know that we\u2019re in the show-me state for this project because of the difficulties we had in our first PDH. I will tell you I have a high level of confidence that PDH 2 will be highly successful and will generate consistent cash flow. As to PDH 1, we recently completed a 46-day turnaround. It was on time, and it was under budget. The restart went exactly as planned, and the unit is operating above design capacity. Sometimes I read reports that make me think investors are worried that we\u2019re running out of projects, and then the next report I pick up makes me think investors are worried that we\u2019re going to spend a dollar. We have never been afraid of opportunity, but we definitely respect this part of the cycle, and our expectation for returns on new projects have moved forward. Going forward, I think you should probably think about our capital run rate as somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. I hear a lot about energy evolution. Note that we don\u2019t say transition. We\u2019re thinking of things like hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization and storage, not just as threats, but as potential opportunities. Angie Murray, our Senior Vice President of Technology Services has taken on additional responsibilities around a deep-dive technical analysis of low-carbon technologies currently under discussion. Over the last two years, Angie and her team have worked closely with Operations and our Big Data team, identifying several areas to significantly cut our operating, in some case, our capital costs. What we\u2019re finding is these are not one-time hit, but are to be thought of as continual improvement. In addition to those responsibilities, Angie\u2019s role has been expanded to include a focus on evolutionary technology for lower-carbon opportunities. We have to have a strong technical focus on these opportunities. For example, for hydrogen, outside of the rather large presence we have today through our petrochemical assets, Angie\u2019s Evolutionary Technologies team, that\u2019s a mouthful, Randy, is leading the initiative to research and analyze where we might go next in applications for things like transportation and storage. Angie\u2019s team is also responsible for helping us understand the technology behind sequestering our own carbon. In addition to hydrogen and carbon capture, there are other new low-carbon areas that could be a fit. For example, as a member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, we are clearly interested in the different technologies used to recycle plastics and what opportunities might exist for Enterprise in handling the resultant products. As to new initiatives, we always have commercially sensitive things we are working on, but most of the things we\u2019re working on expand and in some cases, converts what we already have, think in terms of product upgrade and repurposing underutilized assets done in a manner that gives our customers new markets. Some of these initiatives even fit the definition of energy evolution. However, profitability will always be a prerequisite. Things are never typical, but what has become typical is, regardless of the environment, Enterprise people perform. The groundwork for our performance today was created 5 to 10 years ago, and what we will become in 5 to 10 years is being created today. Our natural extension of our value chain in 5 to 10 years could very well be things like hydrogen transportation and storage or sequestering carbon and transporting, storing and upgrading the by-products produced from recycled plastics. While nothing is off the table, demand for fossil fuel and its derivatives will continue to grow, and that will remain our foundation. And with that, Randy, you got it.\nA - Randy Fowler: Okay. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Starting off with the income statement. As far as on the first quarter, net income attributable to common unitholders for the first quarter of 2021 was $1.3 billion or $0.61 per unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.4 billion or $0.61 per unit on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter of 2020. Net income for the first quarter of this year was reduced by a non-cash asset impairment charge of approximately $66 million or $0.03 per fully diluted unit. The impairment charges were largely related to our legacy coal seam natural gas gathering system and Val Verde treating facility in the San Juan Basin that was held for sale at the end of the quarter. Notably, net income for the first quarter of 2020 included a $187 million or $0.08 benefit from deferred income-tax benefits. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $2 billion for both the first quarters of 2021 and 2020. Free cash flow for the 12 months ending March 2021, that is cash flow from operations less cash used for investing activities, netting out any contribution from our JV partners was 3.1 billion, this compares to 3.4 billion for the comparable trailing 12 months. We generated over $350 million of discretionary free cash flow in the first quarter. That\u2019s cash flow from operations minus capital investments and also minus cash distributions to partners. We believe we remain on track to be discretionary free cash flow positive for the entire year. We declared a distribution of $0.45 with respect to the first quarter to be paid on May 12. This distribution represents 1.1% increase compared with the first quarter of 2020. While we settled $14 million of unit purchases \u2013 unit repurchases in early January, these were associated with open market purchases in the month of December, and that really just the settlement of them. We did not execute any new additional unit purchases in the first quarter of 2021. EPD\u2019s distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined $33 million of EPD units in the open market during the first quarter. This was equivalent to about 1.6 million EPD units purchased off the open market. Our payout ratio, which we define as the sum of cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of our cash flow from operations over the trailing 12 months, was 68% as of March 31, 2021. As we said on our earnings call in February, while we currently expect to generate discretionary free cash flow for 2021, our first priority is financial flexibility until we get better visibility on regulatory, energy and tax policies of this new administration in Congress. We believe it would be premature to provide any distribution growth and buyback guidance at this time. Enterprise has a long history of responsibly returning capital to limited partners. It continues to be one of our primary financial objectives and has been since our IPO. And in fact, since our IPO, we have returned approximately $40 billion of capital to our limited partners, including $4.2 billion in 2020. Moving on to capitalization. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $29 billion at the end of the first quarter. Assuming the first call date for our hybrids or the final maturity date for the hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio is 16.7 years and 21 years, respectively. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.4%. In the first quarter, we repaid 1.325 billion of maturing senior notes using the remaining proceeds from our August 2020 senior notes offering and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under our commercial paper program. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021 was $2.2 billion and $8.3 billion for the 12 months ended with the first quarter. Our consolidated leverage was 3.3 times after adjusting debt for the partial equity credit given by the \u2013 on the hybrid securities given by the rating agencies and further reduced for unrestricted cash. This was at the lower end of our leverage target of 3.5 times plus or minus a quarter, or our target leverage range of 3.25 to 3.75 times. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter. That includes availability under our existing credit facilities and approximately $229 million of unrestricted cash on hand. At this time, we do not foresee the need to access the debt capital markets in 2021. However, depending on market conditions, we may elect to approach the debt capital markets later this year to pre-fund our 2022 maturities. And with that, Randy, I think we can open up with questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Randy. Christie, we\u2019re ready to take questions from our audience. Before you do that, let me remind our listeners, if you would, please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up question. Thank you. Christie, go ahead.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nJim Teague: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: I recognize it\u2019s probably kind of a complex question with Uri, but just want to know if you guys could provide any color as far as net-net what type of benefits you saw from the storm during the quarter, and then just to isolate kind of base business trends, I guess, how you see volumes recovering or not recovering at this point?\nJim Teague: Yes, Jeremy. I\u2019m going to look at Chris. I think around $250 million?\nChris Nelly: Yes.\nJim Teague: Did that answer it, Jeremy?\nJeremy Tonet: Yes. And just the base business then outside of that, do you still see kind of recovering at this point or just \u2013 trying to get a feel for that?\nJim Teague: Absolutely, we see it recovering. If you listen to my script, we\u2019re bullish. I mean, you think about crude oil, since April of last year has gone up, what, damn near $100 a barrel from a negative 37 print.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it.\nJim Teague: Yes. What\u2019s Goldman saying, $80 in the third quarter?\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Got it. And maybe just a quick one on energy evolution. Just wondering, as it relates to carbon capture right now, if you see the 45Q\u2019s being kind of sufficient policy to make projects economic such as gas processing there, and what other opportunities could this breed? I mean, could you have underutilized Permian pipelines move CO2 from the Gulf Coast into the Permian for injection there and kind of tightening take-away market? Just trying to think of what\u2019s possible here.\nJim Teague: Yes, I think everything\u2019s possible, Jeremy. We\u2019re not taking anything off the table. What we have done is we read everybody\u2019s going to net, whatever, past my lifetime. What we\u2019ve decided is we got to take a step back and that\u2019s why Angie\u2019s taken the lead on just looking at the technology associated with all of these different possibilities and understanding the technology. And then working with our people in other parts of \u2013 like our commercial groups and our operations group saying how does that fit here? Hell, if we just captured our own carbon at Mont Belvieu and sequestered it, it\u2019d be a nice thing. Graham?\nGraham Bacon: Yes, it would be about quite a bit. Yes, nothing really to elaborate more on what Jim said. We\u2019re still evaluating all of our pipelines and all of our opportunities. Everything\u2019s on the table and really just got a focused effort on it now and coordinated throughout the organization.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Christine Cho of Barclays.\nChristine Cho: Good morning.\nJim Teague: Good morning.\nChristine Cho: Can you give us an update on your outlook for crude production overall and specifically in the Permian? How that has evolved over the last couple of months, especially with the big surge in private activity in the Permian, how that shapes your volume and price outlook for the rest of this year and maybe next year? And also curious to the competition for getting the barrels from a lot of these private producers, most of which seem to have only one rig operating. And my guess is they don\u2019t have much contracted from the Midstream perspective, but any color would be helpful.\nTony Chovanec: Chris, it\u2019s Tony, I\u2019ll take the first part and Brent may add on the second part. Permian volumes, like everything else, it\u2019s hard to look at the latest EIA reports and make too much sense of it. But the long and the short of it is if you look at frac crews in the Permian, they\u2019re back to about almost 80% of their all-time highs, okay? The facts are the Permian is leading everything. The challenge there is in every other base, if we think about oil, is lagging. It\u2019s really all about Permian. So where we are as we have originally said at our analysts meeting, we thought that we\u2019d have somewhere short of 100,000 barrels December year-end 2020 to 2021 of increase across the United States. We think that number at this point is low. It\u2019s probably closer to 250 in the year 2021, all right? We also said that we thought in 2022 and 2023 that we have about 1.5 million barrels of production increase across the United States. So if you \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to say, is that going to happen in 2022, or is it going to happen in 2023? Of course, it\u2019s very difficult. But if you add that all up, that\u2019s 1.8 million barrels a day of incremental crude over three-year period with it very much loaded in 2022 and 2023s. That\u2019s a pretty good run rate and it\u2019s very much dominated by the Permian Basin. And Brent, I\u2019ll ask you how you think the privates are faring and how they\u2019re contracted.\nBrent Secrest: From our side, we\u2019ve seen these guys very active. At this point, really it comes down to geography and where your assets are. I\u2019d venture to guess we\u2019ve done more deals with privates in the last nine months than we probably did over the last nine years. They\u2019re not big capital projects, but they fill up pipeline capacity, they fill up processing capacity. On the crude side, there\u2019s some production that\u2019s close to our lines, we could use some gathering deals with them, but they\u2019re \u2013 and a lot of stuff is acreage dedication, but we feel very good about their activity and where that\u2019s going to end up.\nChristine Cho: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And then earlier this year, you guys mentioned that you still expect your \u2013 expect to capture $500 million to $600 million of margin from outside spread opportunities and marketing. With the first quarter out of the way and I think to Jeremy\u2019s question you said $250 million from weather impact. Is that $500 million to $600 million still something you\u2019re comfortable with? And where should we expect the remainder to come from in the remaining quarters?\nJim Teague: I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll let somebody else jump in. This is Jim. No, I\u2019m not comfortable with $500 million or $600 million. I think we might be approaching that now. So I think it could likely be a little more than that. What do you think, Randy?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Christine, because a little bit I go back there\u2019s something Jim said really I believe he said it on our fourth quarter call of 2020 and our fourth quarter call of 2019 that over the last few years, what we call out-sized spreads, have ranged $500 million to $800 million. And I think his comment was we seem to always find a way to come in and capture opportunity. And the way this year is shaping up and what we see, I think we may get to that, be back in that same range again this year as well.\nChristine Cho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury of Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi. Good morning. You were at 100% frac utilization at the end of last year. Should we expect another frac FID pretty soon?\nBrent Secrest: Jean, this is Brent. That\u2019s not in our plans.\nJean Ann Salisbury: All right. You guys have a way to send it to third-party frac or something I guess if you go over your capacity.\nBrent Secrest: I think if you look at our system and how we optimize our system and what the variable costs are for us to go access additional capacity, the economics are hard to justify for new frac for Enterprise.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Got it. Helpful. And I think you recently estimated getting approval for the SPOT terminal in the third quarter of this year. Would you need to see some of the rebound I think that Tony just talked about in a previous question? Like would you need to see volumes to start going up to continue to pursue that? Or you\u2019re happy with the project as it is? And as soon as you get the approval, you would need to see the rebound first.\nJim Teague: This is Jim. I think we\u2019re happy with where it is. We\u2019re also in discussions with some other companies as to coming in as joint venture partners, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we didn\u2019t do that.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Tristan Richardson of Truist Securities.\nTristan Richardson: Hi, good morning, guys. Just with the production commentary Tony and Brent discussed and the downstream demand recovery you\u2019re seeing, does this put us on a path for a stronger 2022, even despite sort of the non-recurring margin capture we saw in the first quarter?\nJim Teague: Yes. I\u2019ll start off. Yes. I think we\u2019re pretty bullish. I mean I think Tony said it best. We\u2019ve always had debates between Tony, and I have always been more bullish than he is. And this non-recurring or whatever we call it, and Randy just said it. When you do it every year, why is it nonrecurring? It just happens somewhere else. If it\u2019s not gas marketing, it\u2019s NGL marketing. If it\u2019s not contango, it\u2019s backwardation. We seem to \u2013 we have a footprint that lends itself to when there are issues, we have opportunities.\nTristan Richardson: That\u2019s helpful. And then just you talked about some of the carbon capture, hydrogen renewable gas opportunities. Should we think of the $1.5 billion to $2 billion of high level sort of annual spend as including some of these more energy evolution-oriented projects or technologies? Or would a project that comes in under that sort of umbrella be incremental to that annual number?\nJim Teague: I think the annual number is all inclusive.\nTristan Richardson: Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Shneur Gershuni of UBS.\nShneur Gershuni: Hi, good morning, everyone. Jim, it was very good to hear about the initiatives that you\u2019re embarking upon and Angie\u2019s new responsibilities. Maybe a follow-up to Tristan\u2019s question here. So when I\u2019m sort of thinking about Enterprise in terms of FID CapEx, you have $800 million FID for 2022, and you gave the $1.5 billion to $2 billion longer-term number. If I understood Tristan\u2019s question correctly, some of that may include some of these evolutionary opportunities. Can we assume that\u2019s going to be the case for the 2022 calendar year? How far down the path are we in terms of Angie\u2019s new responsibilities? Are there any technologies in particular that are in the later innings that would get us closer to FID, whether it\u2019s hydrogen or whether it\u2019s carbon capture? I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us a little color on that.\nGraham Bacon: Yes. This is Graham. We\u2019re still identifying what those projects are. Always our first opportunity is to really take the low-hanging fruit, utilize existing assets and minimize the capital and get a big bang for the buck with the assets that we have. Over the longer-term, we\u2019ll develop probably more extensive projects as the technology improves and becomes economical. So at this point, we\u2019re really looking how do we capture the biggest benefit with the assets that we have.\nJim Teague: Yes. We produce so much hydrogen. Graham, 150 million?\nGraham Bacon: 150 million.\nJim Teague: 150 million a day. So \u2013 and we use 40 million, 50 million a day, something like that?\nGraham Bacon: Yes. We\u2019re looking to use more of that. We\u2019re looking at technology that allows us to reuse that a lot more of that at our Mont Belvieu facility. It\u2019s a big bang for the buck on emissions, but it doesn\u2019t cost us a lot of capital. And those are the type of projects that we\u2019re really trying to move forward with as quickly as possible.\nJim Teague: So if we can optimize what we have within our own system and then let it evolve to see what other commercial opportunities might evolve from that carbon capture. If we can sequester our own carbon, then what other opportunities evolve from that? We\u2019re not going to announce a CO2 pipeline out of the Permian today, but who knows down the road.\nShneur Gershuni: That makes a lot of sense. Appreciate the color there. And maybe as kind of a follow-up on your current existing business. I was wondering if we \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure if this is a Jim or Tony question here, but if \u2013 can we talk about the kind of where you see the direction for hydrocarbons right now? We have upstream companies that are looking to be disciplined with respect to growth, so kind of more muted. At the same time, you have changing consumption patterns, whether it\u2019s energy transition or whether it\u2019s just commutes post pandemic. Is exports the path that you see forward to SPOT give Enterprise an opportunity to kind of optimize your asset footprint where you move crude to SPOT, add more LPG and ethane export capacity in the channel? Do you consider exporting refined products? I was just wondering if you can opine on that if you can.\nTony Chovanec: I\u2019ll take it. The forecast of energy economists of late, many of them \u2013 a large portion of them are showing that the U.S. will be back \u2013 I mean that the world will be back to 100 million barrels by the end of 2021. And you see it in diesel consumption, just because of the amount of money there is and pent-up demand. And now you\u2019re seeing it in gasoline comment Jim made in his script. Glad to hear him say that because that is the case around this town. While downtown is somewhat sparse, it\u2019s amazing at the traffic levels. There are no cars on the car lots for sale around Houston. I mean there are some, but there\u2019s a tremendous shortage. People have money. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but the savings rate in the United States has doubled. Those are meaningful stats. So then we look at the news, we see what\u2019s going on in India, which is not real positive for India. But at the end of the day, the U.S. and others are pitching in to get vaccine to India. Europe is going to catch up. We just look at the world, and we look at the change in GDP from 2020, 2021 and the potential for 2022. There\u2019s no way to deny the numbers. They\u2019re very meaningful. So do I think that hydrocarbon demand in the world, that we\u2019re going to see all-time highs probably in 2022? Could well happen. I\u2019ll say I\u2019d be surprised if it didn\u2019t. Randy, do you feel different?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. A little bit will come in and \u2013 again, a little bit of a theme that we talk about is you still have 3 billion people, almost 40% of the world living in energy poverty, meaning cooking with \u2013 not having access to clean cooking, so either cooking with charcoal or cooking with wood and leading to 4 million or 5 million deaths a year with in-home pollution. So there\u2019s still a huge need just to improve human life. And I think we\u2019ve seen it over the last 100 years that nothing has improved human life better than the products that come from natural gas and oil production.\nTony Chovanec: And I think relative to exports, I\u2019m going to start a little bit, and then I\u2019m going to hand over to Brent. But where do you think \u2013 let\u2019s think long-term in that regard and where you think U.S. is going to go as far as electric vehicles and hybrids. Certainly, we\u2019re going to have more of them. We\u2019re going to have efficiency standards on our gasoline. We\u2019re going to do more from an industrial standpoint here. But I don\u2019t talk to as many foreign customers as Brent does, but the message is always the same. We see them on Zoom calls. We\u2019re seeing them in person now, and they want to know that we believe that U.S. producer is in it to win it long-term.\nBrent Secrest: Yes. I think that\u2019s the question is, I mean, do you believe that the U.S. is going to increase production on crude, NGLs, and is there \u2013 are there economics for them to do that? And then at that point, if you believe that, you believe demand here in this country is staying flat to declining, then what\u2019s the most efficient and effective way to get to the water? So when you look at the projects that we have that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, you guys talk about SPOT, that\u2019s the most efficient way to get crude oil to the water. There\u2019s some contractual issues that exist right now, but those will go away. And that project is more strategic to our upstream system, and that\u2019s why we like it. On the NGL side, we still believe in NGL production. Frankly, it has to price to export. So there\u2019s different ways that once these things happen that we can optimize the system.\nShneur Gershuni: Great. Perfect. Really appreciate the expanded discussion. Thank you very much. And that\u2019s all for me today.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Blum of Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just maybe staying on the exports for a minute. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us any kind of real-time look into what you\u2019re seeing in terms of LPG export demand in light of the surge of COVID cases in India.\nJim Teague: What are we exporting?\nBrent Secrest: Yes. This month is\u2026\nJim Teague: 15 million, 16 million?\nBrent Secrest: It\u2019s around there. So it\u2019s not what you saw \u2013 this is Brent. It\u2019s not what we saw in fourth quarter, and there\u2019s some balancing going on right now. I don\u2019t know if as much it\u2019s \u2013 like the demand is there long-term. But if you look at just what prices have done on propane, first quarter of 2020, it was $0.37. Fourth quarter, it was $0.57. First quarter 2021, it was $0.90. So markets work, and you saw the backwardation in some of the LPG markets. And so I think you saw some deferrals or you got some cancellations. And then ultimately, this is how this is going to balance until production starts doing what Tony has talked about in the past. So we\u2019ve seen some drop-off in India. But certainly, China has been able to step up and help fill that gap.\nMichael Blum: Got it. My second question really relates to pipeline capacity rationalization. You talked a bit about that at your Analyst Day, and I\u2019m wondering if you could tell us do you \u2013 are there any discussions going on behind the scenes within the industry to make this happen? Or do you think it\u2019s just something that\u2019s going to be very difficult because there are just too many hurdles to actually achieving it, either yourselves or for the industry? Thanks.\nJim Teague: You\u2019re talking about repurposing pipelines, Michael?\nMichael Blum: Pipeline rationalization, however, it could get done.\nJim Teague: You\u2019re referring to some of Brent\u2019s comments on the last earnings call.\nMichael Blum: Correct.\nJim Teague: Yes. I hesitate to have Brent speak for himself. We\u2019re looking at repurposing for sure. And I think you\u2019ll see more of that. What Brent was saying last quarter is the same, Brent? You don\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s some of these guys that are going to have problems.\nBrent Secrest: I mean if you look at pipelines that don\u2019t have contracts, somebody asked about CO2 being repurposed, I mean, that looks like a good project. If you don\u2019t have contracts and you\u2019re exposed to an arb from a market to another market that\u2019s fairly flat. All the Permian capacity is very competitive regardless of the commodity. And no different than other companies, Enterprise tries to figure out the most efficient ways to move NGLs and crude oil in our system. And we have a Seminole pipeline that\u2019s in crude service and we have an NGL pipeline that, frankly, we only own two-thirds of. So, there\u2019s different ways that we can, as Enterprise, try to rationalize and optimize our capacity to the benefit of Enterprise. As far as the others, I assume they\u2019re doing the same thing.\nJim Teague: Which you\u2019re glad your contracts on crude oil go out to 28.\nBrent Secrest: We are glad our contracts go out there, yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask on capital allocation and Randy you said, again, that you wanted flexibility on redeploying free cash flow early in the year, and highlighted just uncertainty on federal policies, including, I think, you said tax policies. Can you just elaborate on what you\u2019re mainly focused on in the new administration\u2019s infrastructure and related tax plan, or any other potential policy changes you\u2019re focused on for \u2013 for capital allocation?\nRandy Burkhalter: Keith, when you come in and you look at what\u2019s been introduced thus far this year and you \u2013 one of those things, you better look at the newspaper every day to keep in touch. In the last 100 years, there\u2019s really been three big moves in tax policy, and that was the New Deal. It was the Reagan era tax policy. And now as we emerge into the Biden era, this is like the third major tax swing that we we\u2019ve seen in 100 years. And so I think we\u2019re paying attention to see which of these proposals actually make it into legislation and then actually get passed. And I think we\u2019ll be a lot smarter three months, six months from now than we are today. And we think it\u2019s just responsible to \u2013 let\u2019s come in and focus on financial flexibility. And again, we\u2019ll be a lot smarter here in three to six months.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. I guess I\u2019m just curious, like from a \u2013 being an MLP, just how you\u2019re thinking \u2013 are you thinking the tax policy changes could affect you directly? Or just any further thoughts on the tax piece of that.\nRandy Burkhalter: Keith, honestly, we\u2019ve got a 180 of possibilities out there. You\u2019ve got this Financing Our Energy Future Act, which is bipartisan legislation that\u2019s been introduced on the House and the Senate that is actually taking existing MLP tax law and really expanding the scope of it to bring in new activities as qualified earnings such as handling some of this green or blue hydrogen coming in and being able to get into renewables, whether it\u2019s wind or solar, and some of these other activities. So, I actually would be broadening the scope of what qualifies as earnings for an MLP. On the other side of the equation, there\u2019s been a proposal that came out of Senate Finance Committee, it is not bipartisan, it is partisan and I think it\u2019s actually legislation that\u2019s been introduced at least a couple of times before and \u2013 but it never win anywhere. And with that one, it would come in and take business activities that handle fossil fuels what we do today and you would no longer be qualified for pass-through treatment and you would be taxed as a C-Corp. So, really there\u2019s \u2013 the range of possibilities is 180 degrees in here and I think we\u2019ll be spending a good bit of time up in D.C. Some of the legislation is just sort of counter to what some of the objectives that you hear are where \u2013 whether the \u2013 again, this coming in and taking traditional MLPs and then making them subject to taxation sort of goes counter to what we\u2019re trying to do with that Financing Our Energy Future Act is sort of counter to that. It\u2019s sort of counter to the Infrastructure Bill too, you\u2019re out here with a package trying to promote infrastructure but it seems like it\u2019s counter to infrastructure. And finally, the last thing, it seems like it might be a counter too as this whole pivot to Asia, one of the reasons we\u2019ve been able to, as a country I think are able to pivot to Asia is the energy security that the United States has and that we\u2019re not reliant on the Middle East. So some of what we\u2019re seeing out there on the tax front is there seems to be some inconsistency on some of the proposals. But I think this will be an active year in D.C.\nKeith Stanley: All right, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful color. Second question, I guess it\u2019s kind of summing up some of the earlier questions. But last quarter, you guys for the first time indicated 2021 EBITDA to be kind of flattish versus 2020. You had a pretty good Q1 with some strong benefits and you\u2019ve pretty positive tone on the macro environment and on marketing potential and differentials for this year. Is it fair to assume 2021 EBITDA at this point is now tracking better than 2020 or just any rough sense how to think about the year?\nRandy Fowler: Yeah, Keith. Really, I think we\u2019ll just stick with our guidance. We\u2019ll let you guys model it up. You know, we don\u2019t provide formal guidance, not really looking to start on this call. But you do a great job as well with some of your peers. So, we\u2019ll pass on that.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s actually a little bit of a follow-on on thinking about D.C. and legislation. Just curious, I mean Congress is pretty divided. Few people think a 28% tax rate happens. Most think it\u2019s a lower number than that, but it\u2019s also \u2013 we\u2019re 18 months out from the next election and a very divided Congress. How long do you wait, right? Like we may have uncertainty for a long time. Legislation is hard. When you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation, at what point do you say, we start ramping the process because to be blunt, D.C. \u2013 D.C. may take some time?\nRandy Fowler: Yeah. I hear you on that but it seems like this is a \u2013 let\u2019s just say this is a noteworthy Congress and a noteworthy time. And we\u2019ve got the luxury that we can come in and I think if we come in and we see good capital projects, we\u2019re going to allocate our capital there. But to come in and say anything beyond that, I think we\u2019d like to see tax policy looks like. And again, I think in three to six months, we\u2019ll be a lot smarter.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Okay. And then one last question. Just curious, if you move forward with SPOT, how should we think, I mean, given the fact we\u2019re exporting as a nation, what, 2.5 million to 3.5 million barrels a day just depending what we were looking at, and we have a lot more capacity than what we\u2019re actually exporting. How do you think that ripples through the broader supply and demand matrix for those who \u2013 for existing export facilities including some of your own?\nRandy Fowler: I think contracts matter. That\u2019s going to take some time, but that project has a long runway. I mean, there\u2019s no question that crude export capacity is overbuilt, but I do think it will do at the most efficient way, it\u2019ll do at the most economical way. And frankly, when you look at who\u2019s producing crude oil now and it\u2019s larger-type companies, at the end of the day, I do believe they want to deal with larger companies on the service side and they do want to do it the most efficient way.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Cusimano of Heikkinen Energy.\nMichael Cusimano: Hey, good morning. I wanted to first talk about the propylene business. Propylene from frac seems to be doing really well. Can you just maybe talk about your expectations for that business for the rest of the year and maybe your outlooks on spreads also for the rest of 2021?\nJim Teague: Chris, you want to take it?\nChris Nelly: Sure. The outside spreads that we\u2019ve seen over the last several months really a result of the hurricanes and the winter freeze. So, we think things are going to normalize here. But we\u2019re bullish overall, the need for primary petrochemicals. And it goes the same story as LPG. Just the improving quality of life around the world.\nMichael Cusimano: Got it. Okay. And then as a follow-up, I want to talk about that $1.6 billion CapEx number. Is there anything you\u2019re looking at for 2021 that can move that higher or any risk to that number?\nJim Teague: It\u2019s Jim. I don\u2019t think so.\nMichael Cusimano: Okay. Perfect. Well, thank you all. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Christine Cho of Barclays.\nChristine Cho: Hi. I just had a follow-up on the response to one of your earlier questions. You mentioned the possibility of repurposing a pipe this year to service, but I was under the impression that this is pretty difficult to do with the liquids pipeline and may be possible with a gas pipeline since the CO2 pipelines require separate pipelines and a lot more compression. So, curious as to your thoughts here on how capital-intensive such a conversion could be.\nJim Teague: Yeah, Christine. We\u2019re just using it as an example. We agree with you. I think, Graham, it\u2019s\u2026\nGraham Bacon: The pipelines come in all shapes and forms, and some are suitable for conversion to CO2 and some are \u2013 and we have some that are \u2026.\nJim Teague: Christine, we\u2019re not making any announcements.\nChristine Cho: Right. Right. I just was curious as to how that would work in actuality. But, okay. Great. Thanks.\nRandy Fowler: Christy, this is Randy. If there\u2019s no other questions, I think we can go and give our listeners the playback information. And then also, I wanted to thank everyone for joining us today, and have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, to access a replay of today\u2019s call you may dial (800) 585-8367 and reference ID number 3068988.

            "content": "Yes, it would be about quite a bit. Yes, nothing really to elaborate more on what Jim said. We're still evaluating all of our pipelines and all of our opportunities. Everything's on the table and really just got a focused effort on it now and coordinated throughout the organization. Yes. This is Graham. We're still identifying what those projects are. Always our first opportunity is to really take the low-hanging fruit, utilize existing assets and minimize the capital and get a big bang for the buck with the assets that we have. Over the longer-term, we'll develop probably more extensive projects as the technology improves and becomes economical. So at this point, we're really looking how do we capture the biggest benefit with the assets that we have. 150 million. Yes. We're looking to use more of that. We're looking at technology that allows us to reuse that a lot more of that at our Mont Belvieu facility. It's a big bang for the buck on emissions, but it doesn't cost us a lot of capital. And those are the type of projects that we're really trying to move forward with as quickly as possible.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "A - Randy Fowler",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Starting off with the income statement. As far as on the first quarter, net income attributable to common unitholders for the first quarter of 2021 was $1.3 billion or $0.61 per unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.4 billion or $0.61 per unit on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter of 2020. Net income for the first quarter of this year was reduced by a non-cash asset impairment charge of approximately $66 million or $0.03 per fully diluted unit. The impairment charges were largely related to our legacy coal seam natural gas gathering system and Val Verde treating facility in the San Juan Basin that was held for sale at the end of the quarter. Notably, net income for the first quarter of 2020 included a $187 million or $0.08 benefit from deferred income-tax benefits. Moving on to cash flows. Cash flow from operations was $2 billion for both the first quarters of 2021 and 2020. Free cash flow for the 12 months ending March 2021, that is cash flow from operations less cash used for investing activities, netting out any contribution from our JV partners was 3.1 billion, this compares to 3.4 billion for the comparable trailing 12 months. We generated over $350 million of discretionary free cash flow in the first quarter. That's cash flow from operations minus capital investments and also minus cash distributions to partners. We believe we remain on track to be discretionary free cash flow positive for the entire year. We declared a distribution of $0.45 with respect to the first quarter to be paid on May 12. This distribution represents 1.1% increase compared with the first quarter of 2020. While we settled $14 million of unit purchases \u2013 unit repurchases in early January, these were associated with open market purchases in the month of December, and that really just the settlement of them. We did not execute any new additional unit purchases in the first quarter of 2021. EPD's distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined $33 million of EPD units in the open market during the first quarter. This was equivalent to about 1.6 million EPD units purchased off the open market. Our payout ratio, which we define as the sum of cash distributions and buybacks as a percent of our cash flow from operations over the trailing 12 months, was 68% as of March 31, 2021. As we said on our earnings call in February, while we currently expect to generate discretionary free cash flow for 2021, our first priority is financial flexibility until we get better visibility on regulatory, energy and tax policies of this new administration in Congress. We believe it would be premature to provide any distribution growth and buyback guidance at this time. Enterprise has a long history of responsibly returning capital to limited partners. It continues to be one of our primary financial objectives and has been since our IPO. And in fact, since our IPO, we have returned approximately $40 billion of capital to our limited partners, including $4.2 billion in 2020. Moving on to capitalization. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $29 billion at the end of the first quarter. Assuming the first call date for our hybrids or the final maturity date for the hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio is 16.7 years and 21 years, respectively. Our effective average cost of debt is 4.4%. In the first quarter, we repaid 1.325 billion of maturing senior notes using the remaining proceeds from our August 2020 senior notes offering and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under our commercial paper program. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021 was $2.2 billion and $8.3 billion for the 12 months ended with the first quarter. Our consolidated leverage was 3.3 times after adjusting debt for the partial equity credit given by the \u2013 on the hybrid securities given by the rating agencies and further reduced for unrestricted cash. This was at the lower end of our leverage target of 3.5 times plus or minus a quarter, or our target leverage range of 3.25 to 3.75 times. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter. That includes availability under our existing credit facilities and approximately $229 million of unrestricted cash on hand. At this time, we do not foresee the need to access the debt capital markets in 2021. However, depending on market conditions, we may elect to approach the debt capital markets later this year to pre-fund our 2022 maturities. And with that, Randy, I think we can open up with questions."

            "name": "Tony Chovanec",
            "content": "Chris, it's Tony, I'll take the first part and Brent may add on the second part. Permian volumes, like everything else, it's hard to look at the latest EIA reports and make too much sense of it. But the long and the short of it is if you look at frac crews in the Permian, they're back to about almost 80% of their all-time highs, okay? The facts are the Permian is leading everything. The challenge there is in every other base, if we think about oil, is lagging. It's really all about Permian. So where we are as we have originally said at our analysts meeting, we thought that we'd have somewhere short of 100,000 barrels December year-end 2020 to 2021 of increase across the United States. We think that number at this point is low. It's probably closer to 250 in the year 2021, all right? We also said that we thought in 2022 and 2023 that we have about 1.5 million barrels of production increase across the United States. So if you \u2013 and it's hard to say, is that going to happen in 2022, or is it going to happen in 2023? Of course, it's very difficult. But if you add that all up, that's 1.8 million barrels a day of incremental crude over three-year period with it very much loaded in 2022 and 2023s. That's a pretty good run rate and it's very much dominated by the Permian Basin. And Brent, I'll ask you how you think the privates are faring and how they're contracted. I'll take it. The forecast of energy economists of late, many of them \u2013 a large portion of them are showing that the U.S. will be back \u2013 I mean that the world will be back to 100 million barrels by the end of 2021.

So do I think that hydrocarbon demand in the world, that we're going to see all-time highs probably in 2022? Could well happen. I'll say I'd be surprised if it didn't. Randy, do you feel different? And I think relative to exports, I'm going to start a little bit, and then I'm going to hand over to Brent. But where do you think \u2013 let's think long-term in that regard and where you think U.S. is going to go as far as electric vehicles and hybrids. Certainly, we're going to have more of them. We're going to have efficiency standards on our gasoline. We're going to do more from an industrial standpoint here.

Distributable cash flow was $1.7 billion, and 1.8 times coverage, and we retained $700 million. Randy is going to get into the numbers deeper. We couldn't be prouder of our people. Time and time again, whether they're faced with a financial crisis, over 50 inches of rain from Hurricane Harvey at Mont Belvieu, or a combination of pandemic, global price war that was immediately followed by a record Gulf Coast hurricane season, or a historic winter storm that shuts down virtually the entire state, our people prepare, adjust when needed and they execute and make things happen, and for that we are extremely grateful. Relative to the winter storm, forecasters did a great job of calling for a major event, historic event at least a week in advance. As the storm developed, every county in Texas, as you know, was under a winter storm warning. It froze in supplies across the state and affected the entire energy value chain. It impacted much of the generating capacity across the state, at one point, even some of our nuclear. In spite of what you've heard in the press, Texas ended up counting on natural gas as wind generation dropped to near zero at the height of the storm. Our people prepared, backing our pipelines, buying extra gas to prepare for freeze-offs, scheduling our assets and staging themselves in hotels and own cots at our plants. Most of our Texas assets, including our assets at Mont Belvieu and the Ship Channel were offline at the height of the storm mostly intentionally, as we work to make BTUs available through deep rejection, bypass and plant shutdowns. We sold natural gas to electricity generators, natural gas utilities and industrial customers to assist them in meeting their needs. Our gas business, which includes pipelines, gas storage, small gas storage and gas marketing is integral to what we do in many of our other businesses, but it's nowhere near the size of, say, a Kinder Morgan or Energy Transfer. During the freeze, our natural gas team, including the commercial gas control and gas marketing and schedulers worked tirelessly. They knew to start preparing long before the temperature had dropped, then they worked around the clock for days to deal with the problems and the opportunities. And it shows in our results. As to power, our people took proactive steps to minimize our exposure to $9,000 megawatt per hour power through participation in ERCOT's LARS program, which redeploys industrial power supplies to human needs and by voluntarily shedding a significant amount of load. Today, Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast petrochemical plants and refineries have completed repairs and have increased rates, with both industries realizing some of the best margins we have ever seen. As we emerge from COVID-related lockdowns, global demand continues to improve for crude, NGLs, primary petrochemicals and refined products. Diesel demand actually exceeds pre-COVID norms in much of the world, and gasoline demand is picking up, already exceeding 2019 levels in some countries. Downtown Houston is far from fully occupied, but traffic in this city is, at times, already back to what some term as awful. For the first time in my life, I think traffic jams are beautiful. Since April 20, 2020, we have been outspoken about why we felt oil prices would go up dramatically. While economic recoveries aren't uniform, when you look at the world's largest economies, demand has moved up, and all indications are that even Europe isn't far behind. Moving on to capital. We continue to expect our growth in capital investments for 2021 to be $1.6 billion and another $440 million for sustaining capital. The rest of 2021, we continue to be on schedule to complete the expansion of our Acadian Gas system to Gillis, Louisiana, which serves LNG markets, the expansion of our ethane, ethylene and propylene pipeline systems and the construction of our natural gasoline hydrotreater. Our growth capital in 2022 and 2023 for projects currently sanctioned is $800 million and $400 million, respectively. Longer-dated capital commitments are largely around our PDH 2 plant expected online in 2023. We know that we're in the show-me state for this project because of the difficulties we had in our first PDH. I will tell you I have a high level of confidence that PDH 2 will be highly successful and will generate consistent cash flow. As to PDH 1, we recently completed a 46-day turnaround. It was on time, and it was under budget. The restart went exactly as planned, and the unit is operating above design capacity. Sometimes I read reports that make me think investors are worried that we're running out of projects, and then the next report I pick up makes me think investors are worried that we're going to spend a dollar. We have never been afraid of opportunity, but we definitely respect this part of the cycle, and our expectation for returns on new projects have moved forward. Going forward, I think you should probably think about our capital run rate as somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. I hear a lot about energy evolution. Note that we don't say transition. We're thinking of things like hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization and storage, not just as threats, but as potential opportunities. Angie Murray, our Senior Vice President of Technology Services has taken on additional responsibilities around a deep-dive technical analysis of low-carbon technologies currently under discussion. Over the last two years, Angie and her team have worked closely with Operations and our Big Data team, identifying several areas to significantly cut our operating, in some case, our capital costs. What we're finding is these are not one-time hit, but are to be thought of as continual improvement. In addition to those responsibilities, Angie's role has been expanded to include a focus on evolutionary technology for lower-carbon opportunities. We have to have a strong technical focus on these opportunities. For example, for hydrogen, outside of the rather large presence we have today through our petrochemical assets, Angie's Evolutionary Technologies team, that's a mouthful, Randy, is leading the initiative to research and analyze where we might go next in applications for things like transportation and storage. Angie's team is also responsible for helping us understand the technology behind sequestering our own carbon. In addition to hydrogen and carbon capture, there are other new low-carbon areas that could be a fit. For example, as a member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, we are clearly interested in the different technologies used to recycle plastics and what opportunities might exist for Enterprise in handling the resultant products. As to new initiatives, we always have commercially sensitive things we are working on, but most of the things we're working on expand and in some cases, converts what we already have, think in terms of product upgrade and repurposing underutilized assets done in a manner that gives our customers new markets. Some of these initiatives even fit the definition of energy evolution. However, profitability will always be a prerequisite. Things are never typical, but what has become typical is, regardless of the environment, Enterprise people perform. The groundwork for our performance today was created 5 to 10 years ago, and what we will become in 5 to 10 years is being created today. Our natural extension of our value chain in 5 to 10 years could very well be things like hydrogen transportation and storage or sequestering carbon and transporting, storing and upgrading the by-products produced from recycled plastics. While nothing is off the table, demand for fossil fuel and its derivatives will continue to grow, and that will remain our foundation. And with that, Randy, you got it. Good morning. Yes, Jeremy. I'm going to look at Chris. I think around $250 million? Did that answer it, Jeremy? Absolutely, we see it recovering. If you listen to my script, we're bullish. I mean, you think about crude oil, since April of last year has gone up, what, damn near $100 a barrel from a negative 37 print. Yes. What's Goldman saying, $80 in the third quarter? Yes, I think everything's possible, Jeremy. We're not taking anything off the table. What we have done is we read everybody's going to net, whatever, past my lifetime. What we've decided is we got to take a step back and that's why Angie's taken the lead on just looking at the technology associated with all of these different possibilities and understanding the technology. And then working with our people in other parts of \u2013 like our commercial groups and our operations group saying how does that fit here? Hell, if we just captured our own carbon at Mont Belvieu and sequestered it, it'd be a nice thing. Graham? Good morning. I'll start and then I'll let somebody else jump in. This is Jim. No, I'm not comfortable with $500 million or $600 million. I think we might be approaching that now. So I think it could likely be a little more than that. What do you think, Randy? This is Jim. I think we're happy with where it is. We're also in discussions with some other companies as to coming in as joint venture partners, and it wouldn't surprise me if we didn't do that. Yes. I'll start off. Yes. I think we're pretty bullish. I mean I think Tony said it best. We've always had debates between Tony, and I have always been more bullish than he is. And this non-recurring or whatever we call it, and Randy just said it. When you do it every year, why is it nonrecurring? It just happens somewhere else. If it's not gas marketing, it's NGL marketing. If it's not contango, it's backwardation. We seem to \u2013 we have a footprint that lends itself to when there are issues, we have opportunities. I think the annual number is all inclusive. Yes. We produce so much hydrogen. Graham, 150 million? 150 million a day. So \u2013 and we use 40 million, 50 million a day, something like that? So if we can optimize what we have within our own system and then let it evolve to see what other commercial opportunities might evolve from that carbon capture. If we can sequester our own carbon, then what other opportunities evolve from that? We're not going to announce a CO2 pipeline out of the Permian today, but who knows down the road. What are we exporting? 15 million, 16 million? You're talking about repurposing pipelines, Michael? You're referring to some of Brent's comments on the last earnings call. Yes. I hesitate to have Brent speak for himself. We're looking at repurposing for sure. And I think you'll see more of that. What Brent was saying last quarter is the same, Brent? You don't \u2013 there's some of these guys that are going to have problems. Which you're glad your contracts on crude oil go out to 28. Chris, you want to take it? It's Jim. I don't think so. Yeah, Christine. We're just using it as an example. We agree with you. I think, Graham, it's... Christine, we're not making any announcements."

            "content": "From our side, we've seen these guys very active. At this point, really it comes down to geography and where your assets are. I'd venture to guess we've done more deals with privates in the last nine months than we probably did over the last nine years. They're not big capital projects, but they fill up pipeline capacity, they fill up processing capacity. On the crude side, there's some production that's close to our lines, we could use some gathering deals with them, but they're \u2013 and a lot of stuff is acreage dedication, but we feel very good about their activity and where that's going to end up. Jean, this is Brent. That's not in our plans. I think if you look at our system and how we optimize our system and what the variable costs are for us to go access additional capacity, the economics are hard to justify for new frac for Enterprise. Yes. I think that's the question is, I mean, do you believe that the U.S. is going to increase production on crude, NGLs, and is there \u2013 are there economics for them to do that? And then at that point, if you believe that, you believe demand here in this country is staying flat to declining, then what's the most efficient and effective way to get to the water? So when you look at the projects that we have that we've talked about in the past, you guys talk about SPOT, that's the most efficient way to get crude oil to the water. There's some contractual issues that exist right now, but those will go away. And that project is more strategic to our upstream system, and that's why we like it. On the NGL side, we still believe in NGL production. Frankly, it has to price to export. So there's different ways that once these things happen that we can optimize the system. Yes. This month is... It's around there. So it's not what you saw \u2013 this is Brent. It's not what we saw in fourth quarter, and there's some balancing going on right now. I don't know if as much it's \u2013 like the demand is there long-term. But if you look at just what prices have done on propane, first quarter of 2020, it was $0.37. Fourth quarter, it was $0.57. First quarter 2021, it was $0.90. So markets work, and you saw the backwardation in some of the LPG markets. And so I think you saw some deferrals or you got some cancellations. And then ultimately, this is how this is going to balance until production starts doing what Tony has talked about in the past. So we've seen some drop-off in India. But certainly, China has been able to step up and help fill that gap. I mean if you look at pipelines that don't have contracts, somebody asked about CO2 being repurposed, I mean, that looks like a good project. If you don't have contracts and you're exposed to an arb from a market to another market that's fairly flat. All the Permian capacity is very competitive regardless of the commodity. And no different than other companies, Enterprise tries to figure out the most efficient ways to move NGLs and crude oil in our system. And we have a Seminole pipeline that's in crude service and we have an NGL pipeline that, frankly, we only own two-thirds of. So, there's different ways that we can, as Enterprise, try to rationalize and optimize our capacity to the benefit of Enterprise. As far as the others, I assume they're doing the same thing. We are glad our contracts go out there, yes."

            "name": "Randy Fowler",
            "content": "Yes, Christine, because a little bit I go back there's something Jim said really I believe he said it on our fourth quarter call of 2020 and our fourth quarter call of 2019 that over the last few years, what we call out-sized spreads, have ranged $500 million to $800 million. And I think his comment was we seem to always find a way to come in and capture opportunity. And the way this year is shaping up and what we see, I think we may get to that, be back in that same range again this year as well. Yes. A little bit will come in and \u2013 again, a little bit of a theme that we talk about is you still have 3 billion people, almost 40% of the world living in energy poverty, meaning cooking with \u2013 not having access to clean cooking, so either cooking with charcoal or cooking with wood and leading to 4 million or 5 million deaths a year with in-home pollution. So there's still a huge need just to improve human life. And I think we've seen it over the last 100 years that nothing has improved human life better than the products that come from natural gas and oil production. Yeah, Keith. Really, I think we'll just stick with our guidance. We'll let you guys model it up. You know, we don't provide formal guidance, not really looking to start on this call. But you do a great job as well with some of your peers. So, we'll pass on that. Yeah. I hear you on that but it seems like this is a \u2013 let's just say this is a noteworthy Congress and a noteworthy time. And we've got the luxury that we can come in and I think if we come in and we see good capital projects, we're going to allocate our capital there. But to come in and say anything beyond that, I think we'd like to see tax policy looks like. And again, I think in three to six months, we'll be a lot smarter. I think contracts matter. That's going to take some time, but that project has a long runway. I mean, there's no question that crude export capacity is overbuilt, but I do think it will do at the most efficient way, it'll do at the most economical way. And frankly, when you look at who's producing crude oil now and it's larger-type companies, at the end of the day, I do believe they want to deal with larger companies on the service side and they do want to do it the most efficient way. Christy, this is Randy. If there's no other questions, I think we can go and give our listeners the playback information. And then also, I wanted to thank everyone for joining us today, and have a good day. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Randy Burkhalter.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners Conference Call to discuss fourth quarter \u201822 earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise\u2019s General Partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise\u2019s management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Teague.\nJim Teague: Thank you, Randy. At our Analyst Meeting last year, we ended the meeting with all senior management, including Miranda, onto the front to take questions. Becca Followill at the time with US Capital Advisors asked me, what I'd like to see in our future. My answer was that I was tired of eights, I'd like to see a nine. Meaning that I was tired of our adjusted EBITDA starting with an eight, I'd like to see it start with a nine. Some folks took that as guidance, which it wasn't, as at the time, I didn't think it was possible. Once we returned to the office, I was visiting with Tug Hanley, kicking around the idea of creating a company-wide goal of a nine. Doug said, let's call it Project 9. So Tug was immediately appointed Chairman of the Project 9 initiative. Tug was joined by 12 others to lead the effort, one of whom Rick Rainey, implemented an internal communications campaign designed to maintain our focus on Project 9 throughout the year with a poster themed around the Starship Enterprise, stating that we can boldly go where Enterprise\u2019s never gone before. Tug Hanley, Yvette Longonje, [indiscernible] and Daniel Boss introduced the initiative via a company-wide webcast, and Starship Enterprise posters were sent to locations throughout the company. The prize was if we made $9 billion adjusted EBITDA, every employee up to and including senior directors would receive 3,000. And if we exceeded 9.3, they would receive 5,000. It was made clear that there would be no safety shortcuts. And very proud to report today that our core values for safety were reinforced in \u201822 with another year of our best year ever for safety performance with a 0.33 total recordable incident rate. Also, we had zero lost time injuries in our trucking division where they logged something around 20 million miles for the year. We also emphasized that to achieve Project 9, we would not defer maintenance, pipeline integrity, mechanical integrity or anything we would ordinarily do. In other words, no smoke in mirrors. Our message was that no matter your job, you can always do it better. Through webcast, town halls and safety meetings, we encouraged our employees to come up with ideas that would help realize the success of Project 9. We asked them to share ideas and success stories. We received almost 200 success stories that resulted in something around $280 million toward Project 9 success. A couple of examples is we maximized MTBE production blending isobutylene [indiscernible] PIB, and through the [ether max] (ph) increasing MTBE production by a couple of thousand barrels a day. Distribution, operations, commercial and our big data group worked to find a way to adjust fractionation set points to increase throughput at our Mont Belvieu Complex. Project 9 gave every enterprise employee a common goal to boldly go where Enterprise has never gone before. For our folks that listen in on this call, when there is a number, albeit through your hard work, creativity, finding ways to do your job better and teamwork, we made $9.309 billion of adjusted EBITDA. So every employee up to and including Senior Director will be receiving $5,000. We had so much fun with this. And we decided we are going to have Project 9.3 for 2023. Again, don't take it as guidance, because nothing is automatic, especially in this environment.  As to numbers, we generated $7.8 billion of distributable cash flow in 2022 compared to $6.6 billion and \u201821 providing 1.9 times coverage. We retained $3.6 billion in DCF, which compares to $2.6 billion in 2021. We set 13 financial records and 10 operating records in 2022. Operating results included record and NGL pipeline transportation, ethane exports, total NGL marine terminal volumes, fee based natural gas processing and natural gas pipeline transportation. In our petrochemical sector, we set operating records in propylene production, DIB processing and octane enhancement. In barrels of oil equivalent per day, Enterprise transported a record 11.2 million barrels a day of oil equivalent in 2022. Major growth for our capital in '23 in addition to our second PDH, we have four gas processing plants under construction in the Permian and we\u2019re constructing our 12 fractionator in Chambers County and we have expansions in both ethane and ethylene export facilities.  2022 was another volatile year with crude trading as high as $120 and as low as $70. NYMEX natural gas traded between $9.50 to $3.50. Natural gas liquids also was no stranger to volatility. Ethane traded between $0.70 a gallon and $0.25 a gallon and propane traded between $1.60 and $0.60. For 2023, we are constructive on crude oil, but much less so on natural gas. Wide gas to crude spreads should lead to US petrochemicals having a very large cost advantage globally. On the supply side start with the fact that volumes from the strategic petroleum reserve provided a whopping 240 million barrels slug of supplies in the global markets most of it from the US. Those barrels are not going to be here in 2023. China seems to be open. IEA estimates Chinese demand will be up by 1 million barrels a day to 16 million by June. This accounts for one half of expected global oil demand growth. The IEA also expects demand to hit a record of nearly 102 million barrels a day this year, 3/4 of the growth in non-OECD countries, which is just fine with us as we do have a nice real estate position on the water. One thing we believe there will be continued volatility in 2023, but our experience is volatility leads to opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Randy.\nRandy Fowler: All right. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Starting off with the income statement. Fourth quarter net income attributable to common unitholders was $1.4 billion or $0.65 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1 billion or $0.47 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted cash flow from operations, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital was $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. This is a 16% increase compared to $1.8 billion generated for the fourth quarter of 2021. We declared a distribution of $0.49 per common unit for the fourth quarter of '22, which is 5.4% higher than the distribution declared for the fourth quarter of the prior year. The distribution will be paid February 14th to common unitholders of record as of close of business on January 31st. We will evaluate another increase in the distribution midyear in 2023. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.9 million common units at a cost of $120 million. For the entire year, we purchased a total of 10.2 million common units for $250 million. In addition, on a combined basis, our dividend reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased 1.7 million and 6.4 million common units during the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2022, respectively. For 2022, we paid approximately $4 billion of distributions to Limited Partners. Together with our buybacks for 2022, Enterprise's payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations was 54% and our payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow was 71% if you exclude the $3.2 billion investment in the acquisition of Navitas Midstream. Now turning to capital investments. Total capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $763 million, which included $465 million for organic growth capital projects. $160 million for purchases of pipelines and related assets and $138 million of sustaining capital expenditures. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 580 miles of existing pipeline and related assets that enables us to cost effectively optimize and expand our NGL and petrochemical pipeline system on the upper Texas Gulf Coast. Total capital expenditures in 2022 were $5.2 billion, which included $3.4 billion for the acquisition of Navitas and the purchase of the 580 miles of pipelines, $1.4 billion for investment in organic growth capital expenditures and $372 million of sustaining CapEx. Last quarter, we had estimated $1.6 billion of organic growth capital investments in 2022. However, approximately $200 million of this investment slipped into 2023. Our major growth capital projects under construction grew from $5.5 billion last quarter to $5.8 billion. The additional $300 million of projects under construction are really attributable to expansions in the scope of our new ethane -- ethylene export facility and debottlenecking gathering systems in the Permian. As a result of the $200 million of CapEx slipping from 2022 into 2023 and the above additional opportunities in the Permian, we currently expect our 2023 growth capital expenditures to be approximately in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and sustaining capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Our total debt principal outstanding was $28.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. During 2022, we reduced the principal amount of our debt outstanding by $1.3 billion. Assuming the final maturity date of our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio is approximately 20 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.5%. And at December 31st, approximately 96% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $4.1 billion at year end and this includes availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash on hand. In January, we issued $1.75 billion of senior notes comprised of $750 million of three year notes at a coupon of 5.05% and $1 billion of 10 year notes at a 5.35% coupon. We are appreciative of the strong continued support of our debt investors in this offering. We do not expect to return to the capital markets in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.3 billion for 2022 and our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.9 times on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and also reducing by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand. As Jim noted in the earnings release, we expect to achieve a major financial milestone in 2023, that is 25 consecutive years of distribution growth. As we looked at the financial attributes of the 65 companies that comprise the dividend aristocrats, these are the bluest of the blue chips. Some have over 60 consecutive years of dividend growth. The overwhelming majority had debt to EBITDA leverage ratios of less than 3.0 times and almost half were below 2 times. To support our financial goals to responsibly grow the partnership and provide our limited partners with a growing and resilient stream of cash distributions over the long term, we believe we have entered into a new era, which it is wise to have a stronger balance sheet than historical norms in the energy industry. We are seeing our customers in the E&P, refining and petrochemical sectors do likewise. As a result, we are lowering our target leverage ratio from 3.5 times to 3.0 times, plus or minus a quarter of a turn. That is a range from 2.75 times to 3.25 times. And as we've noted earlier, our leverage for 2022 we ended at 2.9 times. So we're in good shape with regard to this new target. We would be willing to temporarily take our leverage ratio above this target zone, if necessary, to complete an acquisition or an organic growth project that is strategic to the partnership. We believe this lower leverage target will be welcomed by our long term oriented investors who value distribution growth and stability. We also believe as more generalist investors consider income producing investments in infrastructure, the combination of Enterprise' avoidance of double taxation and our history of distribution growth, coverage and lower leverage will make EPD attractive and that they may also start to consider EPD among the blue chips. With that, Randy, I think we can open it up for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Randy. Andrew, we're ready to take questions from our participants. I'd like to remind everyone to please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Go ahead, Andrew.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of TJ Schultz with RBC Capital Markets.\nTJ Schultz: First question, just on the 580 miles of pipeline and related assets that you purchased last quarter seems like a good price paid for that. If you could just provide more color on what you were able to purchase, how those assets will be integrated into your system? And if there's any CapEx allocated to that in 2023 that may be driving part of the higher growth capital?\nChris D'Anna: I guess, first off, this is Chris D'Anna. The capital won't increase or hasn't increased as a result of that. Secondly, these pipelines are in a valuable corridor, which is going to allow us to optimize both our NGL business and our petchem business and provide other opportunities.\nZach Strait: This is Zach on the NGL side, I think if we look at the price we paid versus the optionality that Chris is describing, I think it made sense for us.\nJim Teague: I think it saved you capital, Chris, on one of your projects\u2026\nChris D'Anna: It also saves some -- one of the other projects fairly small capital, it saved us a pretty significant amount of capital in that project.\nTJ Schultz: I guess the follow-up is just a general question on capital allocation. You guys clearly continue to maintain plenty of flexibility, strong balance sheet with target debt leverage lower and you already sit there. So I'm just trying to see, do you anticipate any shift to more distribution growth? Is there any more intent on finding some of these acquisition opportunities like you did on the upper Gulf Coast, or how do share buybacks fall in there?\nRandy Fowler: TJ, yes, I think between the Navitas deal and then the two deals that we did at the end of 2022, we are interested in asset acquisition opportunities that make sense that can come in and bolt on to our system and get good returns on capital that way. And that's where the lower leverage gives us flexibility to come in and do these cash transactions to do that. I think over the last, call it the last 18 months, we've shown -- we've sort of completed that pivot to go from an externally funded model to an internally funded model. And we had slowed distribution growth there for about three years or so. And over the last, call it 18 months, we've taken that distribution growth back up to about 5% area. So we have increased the pace of distributions. And then the buybacks, we continue to do that opportunistically. So we feel like we're in good shape to execute on opportunities that come to us in 2023, 2024. So we feel like we're sort of checking the box of returning capital and all of the above and also maintaining lower leverage at the same time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with TPH & Company.\nColton Bean: So just on Project 9.3, I appreciate the distinction that it's an internal goal and not guidance, but two questions there. First, for Jim, has the team ever missed an internal goal? And then secondly, any high level comments as to how you achieve that mark. It seems like commodity margins maybe a bit of a headwind, but then you have some sizable projects entering service throughout the year.\nJim Teague: I don't think we've ever set a goal like this before. So thanks to Becca Followill for being the catalyst to it. We achieved it through everybody doing what they're supposed to be doing, attention to detail, our employees work their butts of for this. And frankly, it created a lot of excitement. You had those posters up everywhere you'd go within Enterprise. And when a truck driver is asking you, how are we doing on Project 9, you know you've got some excitement. Project 9.3, we figured 9.3 in 2022 was quite an achievement. So we'd use that to start on the 2023.\nRandy Fowler: And I don't remember the last time we missed on internal goal.\nJim Teague: You just guaranteed guidance.\nColton Bean: And then maybe just a couple of questions on processing. So I think first, the Midland assets were down about 50 million versus Q3. So any indication as to whether we're at or closer to the fee floors for Navitas now? And then second, keep hold pretty strong margins despite very high Rockies gas prices. So just curious if that was hedge related or any other comments there?\nJim Teague: Natalie, can you answer that?\nNatalie Gayden: Yes, Colton, I'll do my best. Midland down slightly in volume. There was -- if you remember, there is a, I'll call it, a Christmas winter event, where there's some production loss in the field just a little bit. I think it's a little bit longer to get - or producing longer to get back up during that time. I wouldn't count the Rockies out, to be quite honest, high gas prices are pretty good. So watch out for the Rockies. We've hit the C4 maybe once or twice, but Waha has been really volatile. So anyway, some processing margins probably down a little bit, but there's some offsets, there\u2019s some headwinds or some tailwinds that come from that.\nColton Bean: And so it sounds like on the Rockies, the higher price [indiscernible] drilling activity maybe offsetting the replacement cost there for the keep-whole contracts?\nNatalie Gayden: Yes, it's a fair assessment.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Harry Mateer with Barclays.\nHarry Mateer: Randy, a follow-up question on the new leverage target. So historically, the sense I've gotten from you is that you preferred the flexibility of being in the BBB ratings category, but a leverage policy is a policy. So it begs the question given the rating agency upgrade targets are generally around 3 times up into low single As. Is that something you guys now would be open to and potentially welcome?\nRandy Fowler: Harry, I'm going to send this one over to Chris.\nChris D'Anna: Harry, I appreciate the question. From our perspective, despite the lower leverage target, we're still very comfortable at a high BBB rating. From our standpoint, what we don't want to do is have the agencies upgrade us to an A minus and that removes the flexibility for us to be aggressive when it comes to external M&A opportunities, because what we don't want to do is whipsaw the fixed income investor from a high -- from A minus rating to a high BBB rating. So we want to maintain that consistency. So we're very comfortable maintaining the BBB plus rating across the three agencies.\nRandy Fowler: And Harry, I think one other thing the agencies look at on that A minus threshold is also looking at your cash distribution payout with regard to net income. And I think that's just because we returned so much capital to our investors through distributions, I think that maybe a little bit harder threshold for us to overcome. So as Chris said, we're pretty pleased with the BBB plus rating and ample flexibility.\nHarry Mateer: And I guess the follow-up to that is just any sort of guardrails you can give us? I mean I know you mentioned you'd be comfortable taking leverage up higher for opportunities. But any sense you could like frame that out for us in terms of how high on a temporary basis over what sort of time period you'd look to bring leverage down?\nRandy Fowler: Harry, I'll be honest. I can't envision a scenario where we would come in and take leverage up to a level that would threaten a BBB plus rating.\nChris D'Anna: And I think if you -- Harry, again, this is Chris. If you look back a year ago to the Navitas acquisition, I think within that first quarter, that $3 billion acquisition bump leverage up a quarter turn and then it quickly came back down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury: My first one is probably for Tony. Curious about your internal view of NGL pricing versus crude. How long do you anticipate it will take if we ever get there to return to the historical range of NGLs versus trade?\nJim Teague: What's the historical range?\nJean Ann Salisbury: I guess for propane, I think historically, maybe 55% to 60%, something like that.\nTony Chovanec: Propane is going to price itself to go. So at the end of the day, the international markets are going to decide that. I'll let Brent weigh in, but we think you'll see more activity out of China. And so there's there is support for that number as we head into '23 as I see.\nBrent Secrest: I think there's going to be some lag, Jean Ann. I think China has got five PDH plants coming on this year. The plants they have existing currently are not running at full capacity. So as the China reopening occurs, it's just going to take some time to work off some of the inventories over there. And once that economy gets back up and running and there's enough dock capacity in the US then you can potentially see a rebound in LPGs. But it takes time, it's going to take some time.\nJean Ann SalisburyAnalyst: But you think that we're off the trough here, I suppose.\nBrent Secrest: I mean, assuming reopening is going to be consistent, there's no stops and starts, and I would like to think that the trajectory is up on a percentage of crude basis.\nJean Ann Salisbury: And then as a follow-up, Permian crude production estimates have come down over the last six months, I would say, pretty much across the board. The Midland to Houston price spread has kind of also come in. Is spot a more difficult pitch to customers in this environment?\nBrent Secrest: I mean, I think ultimately, when you talk about spot and so like -- I think Tony is going to lay out his forecast in our Investor Day. And I still think when it comes to volume, we have a bullish view of Permian volumes. And the question is, do you believe in the US producer and do you think that volumes are going to increase specifically out of the Permian Basin. And the next question is, do you believe that domestic demand is going to decline. And then ultimately, if you believe that crude production is coming online, it's going to have to find its way to Houston because for the most part, its Corpus pipes are full. And then you got to think about the most environmentally friendly, the most efficient way and the most cost effective way to export those barrels to help them clear. And in terms of the timing on spot when that could potentially come online, our conversations with customers, it's still frankly a project that this market needs. And we've had good conversations. We're in the process of a lot of meetings and a lot of trips. But I'd say, overall, it's been positive.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: I'd actually like to follow up on Jean Ann's question related to spot. As you're working through the process of getting an additional or other anchor shippers, how do you view the demand side of things if you have like a demand pull anchor shipper? Because I believe a lot of the large refining complexes in Asia that were previously under contemplation are taking incrementally more euros at this point. And as that flow reroutes, does that threaten the outlook for spot?\nBrent Secrest: I think ultimately, I mean, we've talked about LPGs, we talk about LNG. This barrel is going to price to export. So from the routes that it takes that maybe different, I don't -- probably at one point in time, Theresa, I would have thought that we would have seen more global type customers. But I do think there's going to be some producer push behind us. I do think we're going to have potentially some traders involved with this project in terms of the advantages on freight to play in that game. But I think our view on global crude demand is probably more aligned with Exxon and BP. And we think that demand is going to be out there and it's going to be out there for a fairly long time. And ultimately, we think a lot of crude oil has to come from this country to satisfy that demand.\nTony Chovanec: With our lighter barrels, it's really a perfect fit for the integration that you see now in the large refineries in Asia that are integrated with petchem operations.\nBrent Secrest: And if you look at the amount of VLCCs that are coming from the Gulf Coast, we're north of 30 a month [J]. There's a lot to share between markets, between the Corpus market and also the Houston market, and that number is going to go up.\nTheresa Chen: And then shifting gears a bit, can you just give us an update on your exposure to Waha basis given your open capacity on the Texas interstate business and your outlook on that through this year as well as the outlook for ethane economics recovery versus projection from the Permian?\nBrent Secrest: The exposure hasn't changed since our Investor Day. So I think we're just probably shy of 400 million a day, Natalie. It has compressed over the last several months. You go back to Tony's forecast, we're still fairly bullish on volumes. There has been a new pipeline that came back online, that adds some compression. But ultimately, we think it's going to be extremely volatile. We do think ethane is going to have to price to be recovered out of the Permian Basin. But if you look at that market, it's not a whole lot different than the LNG market, the whole gas infrastructure in the US is very, very fragile. And when something happens out there, there's a lot of volatility and I think we're going to embrace that volatility as we go forward.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Bank of America.\nNeel Mitra: I wanted to touch on the NGL fractionation fees and volumes on a year-over-year basis. It seems like the market is tighter just with Medford and [indiscernible] frac coming online until mid-2023. Can you talk about the contributing factors, outages, what's driving fees and where you see the market right now?\nZach Strait: So when Medford went down, no doubt, we saw an increase in spot fractionation fees. You since had some cooler weather, which helps with the fractionators run rates. You also had Philips come online with the fractionator. So we've seen that market kind of cool down. We also see a lot of capacity coming online this year, which I think the market needs. And then as far as our results, we obviously had some unplanned downtime. We had -- the vast majority of the down from quarter-on-quarter was due actually to commodity prices and blending, and then some slightly lower frac fees on average, but it wasn't nearly as significant as the blending. Going forward, really excited about Frac 12. I can say pretty confidently that fractionator will be full on day one.\nNeel Mitra: And as a follow-up, looking at the kind of the propylene markets right now, that looks like the tough one with the PGP, RGP spreads. It looks like we're at the trough in Q4. Can you kind of talk about how fast you see that recovering? And then in terms of PDH 2, when it comes online, how do you look at the volume outlook for that in terms of like a dispatch stack once you have that online versus the fractionators in PDH 1?\nChris D'Anna: I think as far as the [RGP] spread, we saw throughout last year that tightening a bit. We've seen that widen out a little bit, but at first month of the year and really, it's more of a supply issue than demand. And ultimately, for that spread to remain wide, we need propylene derivative demand to be strong. So China could play a part in that but we see that a little bit further out, maybe second half of the year. And a big part of that is during COVID propylene goes into durables and we saw that accelerate throughout COVID, the demand for those durables. So we think it's probably second half of this year before we see that demand return.\nJim Teague: What about polyethylene?\nChris D'Anna: Polyethylene demand has strengthened quite a bit. And talking to customers from where we were last year at the end of December, exports grew quite a bit. One of our customers told us that December was the highest month of polyethylene exports that they\u2019ve seen in five years. I guess just going back to your PDH 2 question. PDH 2 is 100% subscribed, so that's going to be day one pull.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: It's been touched on a few different ways already, but I just want to bring it all together with regards to just economic conditions out there, potential and pending recession. And just wondering, specifically as it relates to your petchem business, how you see that faring in this environment? I think there's some concern in the marketplace on that. So just wondering if you could walk us through the level of cash flow stability or other offsets that you see in that business line. Also, do you have any planned downtime for any of those facilities in '23?\nChris D'Anna: I guess our petchem business is predominantly fee based. And what we saw last year was as spreads were wider than normal, we were able to capture -- because of the way we structure our contracts, we were able to capture a part of that. Looking for '23, on our octane business, we're about 75% hedged at a pretty good spread. And then we expect the earnings for our propylene [better] and PDH to be pretty consistent.\nJeremy Tonet: And maybe just one last one, if I could, as it relates to capital out there. Enterprise clearly has a fortress balance sheet relative to others in the space, and it seems like you can afford to be opportunistic if the right opportunity comes. How do you view the current, I guess, market out there as far as potentially acquiring assets, private or what have you? Is there anything -- any other part of the portfolio that you would look to kind of round out through M&A?\nJim Teague: We -- getting a position in the Midland Basin was important to us, and it's proved to be pretty successful. I think Randy Fowler always says price matters and price does matter. I think we're in a position right now that if there's anything out there, it's got to be pretty damn strategic for us to get interested.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum:  wanted to go back to natural gas for a moment. With the exception, maybe putting the Waha aside, which I think we all understand. Can you maybe just talk through the puts and takes on how this lower natural gas price environment will impact your business this year?\nBrent Secrest: You said it, Michael, there is a lot of puts and takes. Lower price obviously affects our equity gas and that's probably around $100 million a day. But if you look at our total gas burn and you equate our power consumption and you want to call that natural gas, at different price levels, we get imbalance. And the higher price, there's probably some knock on benefits to us, but there's a lot of pass throughs associated with this price. I mean the ultimate would be go sell the equity gas at the highest number, just wait and catch these load numbers, but we run a fairly balanced portfolio and it's not -- as Jim said, it's fairly balanced. The last thing I'll say, Michael, is that when you look at throughput in US petrochemical industry and you look at load gas and high crude, I mean, there's a lot of benefits for our pipeline system.\nMichael Blum: Just had one other question really about distribution growth in 2023 and beyond really. So you obviously raised the rate of growth in 2022. So I'm just wondering is that a new run rate, is there a reasonable range to think about going forward? And then kind of related to that, are you going to be going to like a one increase per year type of model?\nRandy Fowler: Michael, I guess we did two increases in 2022. And we said we'll come in and take another look at it at the middle of this year, really don't want to come in and put out a marker of where expected distribution growth is going to be. We'll come in and take a look at it mid year. Certainly, we pivoted off the slower rate that we saw there as we went from an internal funding -- I mean, external funding model to an internal funding model. So you've seen that the growth bounced back up into the 5% area and we'll come in and evaluate it as we do every quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS.\nBrian Reynolds: We continue to hear discussions on the higher GORs in the Permian along with just continued discussion on parent child interactions. Curious if you could just discuss if you're seeing higher GORs and higher parent child interactions that perhaps changing your view to the upside on associated gas production in the Permian going forward.\nTony Chovanec: The answer is we are continuing to see higher GORs. It's not surprising. Look, putting it simplistically, oil declines faster than natural gas and shale basins. So we modeled it and we projected in our projections. Relative to parent child, I'll tell you how we feel about it as a midstream company and watching all the rhetoric around it. We think parent child is a good thing, not a bad thing. And producers are learning more and more every day about it. And obviously, producers are getting larger in scale. We think when we read the different rags that parent child is a bad thing, it absolutely is a good thing. It's how you get the most out of the reservoir. So frankly, we don't sit up at night and -- the producers and we see a lot of them and have a lot of talks with them in their conference room for things that we're doing with them. I have to tell you, I don't think any of the major producers are losing any sleep over it either. Brent, do you agree\u2026\nBrent Secrest: I think that\u2019s dead on.\nBrian Reynolds: And maybe to touch briefly on just future growth projects. Post the quarterly results, it seems like free cash flow profile is keeping pace with the recent rise in growth CapEx. Just given Slide 6 in the presentation is largely unchanged, curious if you could provide a little color into whether we're seeing new projects, i.e., processing plants are PDH 3 perhaps in the future, or is the rise in CapEx really just a function of maybe upsizing the existing projects, i.e., ethane exports or perhaps Shin Oak?\nJim Teague: I think our ethane and ethylene export expansions are pretty key. We're going to see a lot more demand for those products going forward. Our ethylene export is chockablock full and our ethane exports are growing. So I like those. We're building four processing plants in the Permian, two in the Delaware, two in Midland basin and probably all have Zach Strait knocking on the door, want to do the 14th fractionator, because we're not going to do 13. But on a lot of our projects, there's a knock on effect that we get out of those projects. So I can't think beyond where we are.\nZach Strait: And probably add in some cost-efficient debottlenecking and the gathering\u2026\nJim Teague: Yes, we just picked up 580 miles of pipe for how much money?\nRandy Fowler: $160 million\u2026\nJim Teague: $160 million in really key quarters. I mean, those kind of bolt-on deals will do all day long. As to PDH 3, I'll throw Chris D\u2019Ann out of my office if he walks in with PDH 3.\nRandy Fowler: And as one astute analysts put it, it takes money to make money.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist.\nNeal Dingmann: My question is also on the petrochem and refined segment specifically. Could you give me an idea of your sales volume expectations for the remainder of the year for your Chambers County propylene facility, wondered any more downtime expected there? And then maybe secondly, just is that PDH 2 facility in Texas Western System still on pace for next quarter and later this year respectively?\nJim Teague: I think Texas Western is toward the end of the year, Graham?\nGraham Bacon: Yes, that come on in stages.\nJim Teague: And PDH 2 is midyear?\nGraham Bacon: Yes.\nChris D'Anna: And just in terms of sales, we expect those to be pretty stable. It's really a function of refinery grade propylene supply coming out of the refineries and what their run rates are. And so looking at cracks today, it's pretty profitable for them to run. So I would expect that to continue.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Mackay: Maybe just going back to the Permian. We had -- I guess there was a bit of a debate last quarter on just the pace of growth going forward. The Shin Oak kind of pushed to the right fell out of that, I guess. Just curious if you could update us there on again, when you think Shin Oak might be needed? I know you have the early \u201825 in the deck. So maybe just puts and takes on that timing and your general view on kind of NGL growth beyond this year out of the Permian.\nJustin Kleiderer: This is Justin Kleiderer, I'll speak to Shin Oak timing. I think we still feel good about that first half of \u201825. There's probably room for it to be accelerated given its two years from now. And in the meantime, we've got various amounts of options to create incremental capacity if that first half '25 doesn't prove early enough and we can't accelerate it. So we feel good at least for the next couple of years that we've got enough capacity. And then beyond that, we'll continue to evaluate what projects are needed to make sure that we have enough capacity going forward.\nTony Chovanec: Relative to Permian production, just so everybody know the EIA reported yesterday growth in crude from year end \u201821 year to November of 741,000 barrels, that was down from what they reported in October. So I know that we hear different things and everybody looks at their own acreage and capture our own numbers. But these are -- for lack of a better term, these are what the EIA calls actuals. We go back and we gauge our numbers to them. So we take a look back in our own models and directionally, these numbers are correct. And almost all of it, I'll use that term [loosely], but comes out of the Permian Basin, has liquids associated with it. So no change in the trend for us relative to what the production profile out in the Permian Basin.\nJohn Mackay: One quick one should be easy. Can you just remind us, are we done with the Eagle Ford contract roll offs? And maybe an update on what you're thinking about the basin overall?\nJim Teague: We had a major producer tell us we're in the second inning of a nine inning game in the Eagle Ford. I mean, the Permian just kind of dwarfs everything. But we had some -- our contracts and the ones we did have some roll-off. We renegotiated a lot of those and ended up with life of lease dedications, which we kind of like. It seems like it's becoming -- it's becoming kind of like the [Haynesville]. It's regional players and that's where they are and that's where they're going to drill. But we haven't forgotten the Eagle Ford by a long shot.\nRandy Fowler: And our assets remain very full in the Eagle Ford, that would be a fair statement. Natalie?\nNatalie Gayden: So processing, certainly, much fuller than the last two years, for sure.\nBrent Secrest: Crude got capacity, but the contract roll-offs are over. I'd like to think everything that we had, incrementally, it\u2019s going to be beneficial from a profitability standpoint.\nJohn Mackay: That\u2019s great. I appreciate the time.\nRandy Burkhalter: Andrew, I think our time is up for today. And so I just wanted to thank all our participants for joining us for our call. And with that, we will be terminating or ending the call. And thank you, and have a good day. Bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

Secondly, these pipelines are in a valuable corridor, which is going to allow us to optimize both our NGL business and our petchem business and provide other opportunities. It also saves some -- one of the other projects fairly small capital, it saved us a pretty significant amount of capital in that project. Harry, I appreciate the question. From our perspective, despite the lower leverage target, we're still very comfortable at a high BBB rating. From our standpoint, what we don't want to do is have the agencies upgrade us to an A minus and that removes the flexibility for us to be aggressive when it comes to external M&A opportunities, because what we don't want to do is whipsaw the fixed income investor from a high -- from A minus rating to a high BBB rating. So we want to maintain that consistency. So we're very comfortable maintaining the BBB plus rating across the three agencies. And I think if you -- Harry, again, this is Chris. If you look back a year ago to the Navitas acquisition, I think within that first quarter, that $3 billion acquisition bump leverage up a quarter turn and then it quickly came back down. I think as far as the [RGP] spread, we saw throughout last year that tightening a bit.

            "name": "Jim Teague",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. At our Analyst Meeting last year, we ended the meeting with all senior management, including Miranda, onto the front to take questions. Becca Followill at the time with US Capital Advisors asked me, what I'd like to see in our future. My answer was that I was tired of eights, I'd like to see a nine. Meaning that I was tired of our adjusted EBITDA starting with an eight, I'd like to see it start with a nine. Some folks took that as guidance, which it wasn't, as at the time, I didn't think it was possible. Once we returned to the office, I was visiting with Tug Hanley, kicking around the idea of creating a company-wide goal of a nine. Doug said, let's call it Project 9. So Tug was immediately appointed Chairman of the Project 9 initiative. Tug was joined by 12 others to lead the effort, one of whom Rick Rainey, implemented an internal communications campaign designed to maintain our focus on Project 9 throughout the year with a poster themed around the Starship Enterprise, stating that we can boldly go where Enterprise's never gone before. Tug Hanley, Yvette Longonje, [indiscernible] and Daniel Boss introduced the initiative via a company-wide webcast, and Starship Enterprise posters were sent to locations throughout the company. The prize was if we made $9 billion adjusted EBITDA, every employee up to and including senior directors would receive 3,000. And if we exceeded 9.3, they would receive 5,000. It was made clear that there would be no safety shortcuts. And very proud to report today that our core values for safety were reinforced in \u201822 with another year of our best year ever for safety performance with a 0.33 total recordable incident rate. Also, we had zero lost time injuries in our trucking division where they logged something around 20 million miles for the year. We also emphasized that to achieve Project 9, we would not defer maintenance, pipeline integrity, mechanical integrity or anything we would ordinarily do. In other words, no smoke in mirrors. Our message was that no matter your job, you can always do it better. Through webcast, town halls and safety meetings, we encouraged our employees to come up with ideas that would help realize the success of Project 9. We asked them to share ideas and success stories. We received almost 200 success stories that resulted in something around $280 million toward Project 9 success. A couple of examples is we maximized MTBE production blending isobutylene [indiscernible] PIB, and through the [ether max] (ph) increasing MTBE production by a couple of thousand barrels a day. Distribution, operations, commercial and our big data group worked to find a way to adjust fractionation set points to increase throughput at our Mont Belvieu Complex. Project 9 gave every enterprise employee a common goal to boldly go where Enterprise has never gone before. For our folks that listen in on this call, when there is a number, albeit through your hard work, creativity, finding ways to do your job better and teamwork, we made $9.309 billion of adjusted EBITDA. So every employee up to and including Senior Director will be receiving $5,000. We had so much fun with this. And we decided we are going to have Project 9.3 for 2023. Again, don't take it as guidance, because nothing is automatic, especially in this environment.  As to numbers, we generated $7.8 billion of distributable cash flow in 2022 compared to $6.6 billion and \u201821 providing 1.9 times coverage. We retained $3.6 billion in DCF, which compares to $2.6 billion in 2021. We set 13 financial records and 10 operating records in 2022. Operating results included record and NGL pipeline transportation, ethane exports, total NGL marine terminal volumes, fee based natural gas processing and natural gas pipeline transportation. In our petrochemical sector, we set operating records in propylene production, DIB processing and octane enhancement. In barrels of oil equivalent per day, Enterprise transported a record 11.2 million barrels a day of oil equivalent in 2022. Major growth for our capital in '23 in addition to our second PDH, we have four gas processing plants under construction in the Permian and we're constructing our 12 fractionator in Chambers County and we have expansions in both ethane and ethylene export facilities.  2022 was another volatile year with crude trading as high as $120 and as low as $70. NYMEX natural gas traded between $9.50 to $3.50. Natural gas liquids also was no stranger to volatility. Ethane traded between $0.70 a gallon and $0.25 a gallon and propane traded between $1.60 and $0.60. For 2023, we are constructive on crude oil, but much less so on natural gas. Wide gas to crude spreads should lead to US petrochemicals having a very large cost advantage globally. On the supply side start with the fact that volumes from the strategic petroleum reserve provided a whopping 240 million barrels slug of supplies in the global markets most of it from the US. Those barrels are not going to be here in 2023. China seems to be open. IEA estimates Chinese demand will be up by 1 million barrels a day to 16 million by June. This accounts for one half of expected global oil demand growth. The IEA also expects demand to hit a record of nearly 102 million barrels a day this year, 3/4 of the growth in non-OECD countries, which is just fine with us as we do have a nice real estate position on the water. One thing we believe there will be continued volatility in 2023, but our experience is volatility leads to opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Randy. I think it saved you capital, Chris, on one of your projects... I don't think we've ever set a goal like this before. So thanks to Becca Followill for being the catalyst to it. We achieved it through everybody doing what they're supposed to be doing, attention to detail, our employees work their butts of for this. And frankly, it created a lot of excitement. You had those posters up everywhere you'd go within Enterprise. And when a truck driver is asking you, how are we doing on Project 9, you know you've got some excitement. Project 9.3, we figured 9.3 in 2022 was quite an achievement. So we'd use that to start on the 2023. You just guaranteed guidance. Natalie, can you answer that? What's the historical range? What about polyethylene? We -- getting a position in the Midland Basin was important to us, and it's proved to be pretty successful. I think Randy Fowler always says price matters and price does matter. I think we're in a position right now that if there's anything out there, it's got to be pretty damn strategic for us to get interested. I think our ethane and ethylene export expansions are pretty key. We're going to see a lot more demand for those products going forward. Our ethylene export is chockablock full and our ethane exports are growing. So I like those. We're building four processing plants in the Permian, two in the Delaware, two in Midland basin and probably all have Zach Strait knocking on the door, want to do the 14th fractionator, because we're not going to do 13. But on a lot of our projects, there's a knock on effect that we get out of those projects. So I can't think beyond where we are. Yes, we just picked up 580 miles of pipe for how much money? $160 million in really key quarters. I mean, those kind of bolt-on deals will do all day long. As to PDH 3, I'll throw Chris D'Ann out of my office if he walks in with PDH 3. I think Texas Western is toward the end of the year, Graham? And PDH 2 is midyear? We had a major producer tell us we're in the second inning of a nine inning game in the Eagle Ford. I mean, the Permian just kind of dwarfs everything. But we had some -- our contracts and the ones we did have some roll-off. We renegotiated a lot of those and ended up with life of lease dedications, which we kind of like. It seems like it's becoming -- it's becoming kind of like the [Haynesville]. It's regional players and that's where they are and that's where they're going to drill. But we haven't forgotten the Eagle Ford by a long shot."

There was -- if you remember, there is a, I'll call it, a Christmas winter event, where there's some production loss in the field just a little bit. I think it's a little bit longer to get - or producing longer to get back up during that time. I wouldn't count the Rockies out, to be quite honest, high gas prices are pretty good. So watch out for the Rockies. We've hit the C4 maybe once or twice, but Waha has been really volatile. So anyway, some processing margins probably down a little bit, but there's some offsets, there's some headwinds or some tailwinds that come from that. Yes, it's a fair assessment. So processing, certainly, much fuller than the last two years, for sure."

            "name": "Brent Secrest",
            "content": "I think there's going to be some lag, Jean Ann. I think China has got five PDH plants coming on this year. The plants they have existing currently are not running at full capacity. So as the China reopening occurs, it's just going to take some time to work off some of the inventories over there. And once that economy gets back up and running and there's enough dock capacity in the US then you can potentially see a rebound in LPGs. But it takes time, it's going to take some time. I mean, assuming reopening is going to be consistent, there's no stops and starts, and I would like to think that the trajectory is up on a percentage of crude basis. I mean, I think ultimately, when you talk about spot and so like -- I think Tony is going to lay out his forecast in our Investor Day. And I still think when it comes to volume, we have a bullish view of Permian volumes. And the question is, do you believe in the US producer and do you think that volumes are going to increase specifically out of the Permian Basin. And the next question is, do you believe that domestic demand is going to decline. And then ultimately, if you believe that crude production is coming online, it's going to have to find its way to Houston because for the most part, its Corpus pipes are full. And then you got to think about the most environmentally friendly, the most efficient way and the most cost effective way to export those barrels to help them clear. And in terms of the timing on spot when that could potentially come online, our conversations with customers, it's still frankly a project that this market needs. And we've had good conversations. We're in the process of a lot of meetings and a lot of trips. But I'd say, overall, it's been positive. I think ultimately, I mean, we've talked about LPGs, we talk about LNG. This barrel is going to price to export. So from the routes that it takes that maybe different, I don't -- probably at one point in time, Theresa, I would have thought that we would have seen more global type customers. But I do think there's going to be some producer push behind us. I do think we're going to have potentially some traders involved with this project in terms of the advantages on freight to play in that game. But I think our view on global crude demand is probably more aligned with Exxon and BP. And we think that demand is going to be out there and it's going to be out there for a fairly long time. And ultimately, we think a lot of crude oil has to come from this country to satisfy that demand. And if you look at the amount of VLCCs that are coming from the Gulf Coast, we're north of 30 a month [J]. There's a lot to share between markets, between the Corpus market and also the Houston market, and that number is going to go up. The exposure hasn't changed since our Investor Day. So I think we're just probably shy of 400 million a day, Natalie. It has compressed over the last several months. You go back to Tony's forecast, we're still fairly bullish on volumes. There has been a new pipeline that came back online, that adds some compression. But ultimately, we think it's going to be extremely volatile. We do think ethane is going to have to price to be recovered out of the Permian Basin. But if you look at that market, it's not a whole lot different than the LNG market, the whole gas infrastructure in the US is very, very fragile. And when something happens out there, there's a lot of volatility and I think we're going to embrace that volatility as we go forward. You said it, Michael, there is a lot of puts and takes. Lower price obviously affects our equity gas and that's probably around $100 million a day. But if you look at our total gas burn and you equate our power consumption and you want to call that natural gas, at different price levels, we get imbalance. And the higher price, there's probably some knock on benefits to us, but there's a lot of pass throughs associated with this price. I mean the ultimate would be go sell the equity gas at the highest number, just wait and catch these load numbers, but we run a fairly balanced portfolio and it's not -- as Jim said, it's fairly balanced. The last thing I'll say, Michael, is that when you look at throughput in US petrochemical industry and you look at load gas and high crude, I mean, there's a lot of benefits for our pipeline system. I think that's dead on. Crude got capacity, but the contract roll-offs are over. I'd like to think everything that we had, incrementally, it's going to be beneficial from a profitability standpoint."

So when Medford went down, no doubt, we saw an increase in spot fractionation fees. You since had some cooler weather, which helps with the fractionators run rates. You also had Philips come online with the fractionator. So we've seen that market kind of cool down. We also see a lot of capacity coming online this year, which I think the market needs. And then as far as our results, we obviously had some unplanned downtime. We had -- the vast majority of the down from quarter-on-quarter was due actually to commodity prices and blending, and then some slightly lower frac fees on average, but it wasn't nearly as significant as the blending. Going forward, really excited about Frac 12. I can say pretty confidently that fractionator will be full on day one. And probably add in some cost-efficient debottlenecking and the gathering..."

First, for Jim, has the team ever missed an internal goal? And then secondly, any high level comments as to how you achieve that mark. It seems like commodity margins maybe a bit of a headwind, but then you have some sizable projects entering service throughout the year. And then maybe just a couple of questions on processing. So I think first, the Midland assets were down about 50 million versus Q3. So any indication as to whether we're at or closer to the fee floors for Navitas now? And then second, keep hold pretty strong margins despite very high Rockies gas prices. So just curious if that was hedge related or any other comments there? And so it sounds like on the Rockies, the higher price [indiscernible] drilling activity maybe offsetting the replacement cost there for the keep-whole contracts?"

            "name": "Randy Fowler",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Starting off with the income statement. Fourth quarter net income attributable to common unitholders was $1.4 billion or $0.65 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1 billion or $0.47 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted cash flow from operations, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital was $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. This is a 16% increase compared to $1.8 billion generated for the fourth quarter of 2021. We declared a distribution of $0.49 per common unit for the fourth quarter of '22, which is 5.4% higher than the distribution declared for the fourth quarter of the prior year. The distribution will be paid February 14th to common unitholders of record as of close of business on January 31st. We will evaluate another increase in the distribution midyear in 2023. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.9 million common units at a cost of $120 million. For the entire year, we purchased a total of 10.2 million common units for $250 million. In addition, on a combined basis, our dividend reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased 1.7 million and 6.4 million common units during the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2022, respectively. For 2022, we paid approximately $4 billion of distributions to Limited Partners. Together with our buybacks for 2022, Enterprise's payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations was 54% and our payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow was 71% if you exclude the $3.2 billion investment in the acquisition of Navitas Midstream. Now turning to capital investments. Total capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $763 million, which included $465 million for organic growth capital projects. $160 million for purchases of pipelines and related assets and $138 million of sustaining capital expenditures. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 580 miles of existing pipeline and related assets that enables us to cost effectively optimize and expand our NGL and petrochemical pipeline system on the upper Texas Gulf Coast. Total capital expenditures in 2022 were $5.2 billion, which included $3.4 billion for the acquisition of Navitas and the purchase of the 580 miles of pipelines, $1.4 billion for investment in organic growth capital expenditures and $372 million of sustaining CapEx. Last quarter, we had estimated $1.6 billion of organic growth capital investments in 2022. However, approximately $200 million of this investment slipped into 2023. Our major growth capital projects under construction grew from $5.5 billion last quarter to $5.8 billion. The additional $300 million of projects under construction are really attributable to expansions in the scope of our new ethane -- ethylene export facility and debottlenecking gathering systems in the Permian. As a result of the $200 million of CapEx slipping from 2022 into 2023 and the above additional opportunities in the Permian, we currently expect our 2023 growth capital expenditures to be approximately in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and sustaining capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Our total debt principal outstanding was $28.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. During 2022, we reduced the principal amount of our debt outstanding by $1.3 billion. Assuming the final maturity date of our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio is approximately 20 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.5%. And at December 31st, approximately 96% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $4.1 billion at year end and this includes availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash on hand. In January, we issued $1.75 billion of senior notes comprised of $750 million of three year notes at a coupon of 5.05% and $1 billion of 10 year notes at a 5.35% coupon. We are appreciative of the strong continued support of our debt investors in this offering. We do not expect to return to the capital markets in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.3 billion for 2022 and our consolidated leverage ratio was 2.9 times on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and also reducing by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand. As Jim noted in the earnings release, we expect to achieve a major financial milestone in 2023, that is 25 consecutive years of distribution growth. As we looked at the financial attributes of the 65 companies that comprise the dividend aristocrats, these are the bluest of the blue chips. Some have over 60 consecutive years of dividend growth. The overwhelming majority had debt to EBITDA leverage ratios of less than 3.0 times and almost half were below 2 times. To support our financial goals to responsibly grow the partnership and provide our limited partners with a growing and resilient stream of cash distributions over the long term, we believe we have entered into a new era, which it is wise to have a stronger balance sheet than historical norms in the energy industry. We are seeing our customers in the E&P, refining and petrochemical sectors do likewise. As a result, we are lowering our target leverage ratio from 3.5 times to 3.0 times, plus or minus a quarter of a turn. That is a range from 2.75 times to 3.25 times. And as we've noted earlier, our leverage for 2022 we ended at 2.9 times. So we're in good shape with regard to this new target. We would be willing to temporarily take our leverage ratio above this target zone, if necessary, to complete an acquisition or an organic growth project that is strategic to the partnership. We believe this lower leverage target will be welcomed by our long term oriented investors who value distribution growth and stability. We also believe as more generalist investors consider income producing investments in infrastructure, the combination of Enterprise' avoidance of double taxation and our history of distribution growth, coverage and lower leverage will make EPD attractive and that they may also start to consider EPD among the blue chips. With that, Randy, I think we can open it up for questions. TJ, yes, I think between the Navitas deal and then the two deals that we did at the end of 2022, we are interested in asset acquisition opportunities that make sense that can come in and bolt on to our system and get good returns on capital that way. And that's where the lower leverage gives us flexibility to come in and do these cash transactions to do that. I think over the last, call it the last 18 months, we've shown -- we've sort of completed that pivot to go from an externally funded model to an internally funded model. And we had slowed distribution growth there for about three years or so. And over the last, call it 18 months, we've taken that distribution growth back up to about 5% area. So we have increased the pace of distributions. And then the buybacks, we continue to do that opportunistically. So we feel like we're in good shape to execute on opportunities that come to us in 2023, 2024. So we feel like we're sort of checking the box of returning capital and all of the above and also maintaining lower leverage at the same time. And I don't remember the last time we missed on internal goal. Harry, I'm going to send this one over to Chris. And Harry, I think one other thing the agencies look at on that A minus threshold is also looking at your cash distribution payout with regard to net income. And I think that's just because we returned so much capital to our investors through distributions, I think that maybe a little bit harder threshold for us to overcome. So as Chris said, we're pretty pleased with the BBB plus rating and ample flexibility. Harry, I'll be honest. I can't envision a scenario where we would come in and take leverage up to a level that would threaten a BBB plus rating. Michael, I guess we did two increases in 2022. And we said we'll come in and take another look at it at the middle of this year, really don't want to come in and put out a marker of where expected distribution growth is going to be. We'll come in and take a look at it mid year. Certainly, we pivoted off the slower rate that we saw there as we went from an internal funding -- I mean, external funding model to an internal funding model. So you've seen that the growth bounced back up into the 5% area and we'll come in and evaluate it as we do every quarter. $160 million... And as one astute analysts put it, it takes money to make money. And our assets remain very full in the Eagle Ford, that would be a fair statement. Natalie?"

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference may be recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Randy Burkhalter, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Josh. And good morning, everyone and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss third quarter 2022 earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise\u2019s general partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the Company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise\u2019s management team. Although, management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. And so, with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.\nJim Teague: Thank you, Randy. Today, we reported exceptional results for the latest quarter. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 billion for the quarter. We also generated $1.9 billion distributable cash flow, providing 1.8 times coverage. We retained $826 million in DCF, taking us to $2.6 billion for the first nine months. We achieved six operating records, including transporting the record 11.3 million barrels per day of oil equivalent in the form of NGLs, crude oil, natural gas, refined products and petrochemicals. We transported a record of 17.5 trillion Btus per day of natural gas. We also set quarterly volumetric records for NGL fractionation, ethane exports, butane isomerization and fee-based natural gas liquids. Just a minute. I\u2019ve lost my place. And I won\u2019t tell you who I am. Earnings from our Midland Basin natural gas gathering and processing business and higher gross operating margins from our natural gas processing, octane enhancement and natural gas pipeline businesses were particularly exceptional for the quarter. Today, uncertainties in the global economic environment are weighing on the petrochemical industry, where sluggish demand is leading to reduced runs and destocking. There are some serious concerns about recession, especially in Europe, where the question isn\u2019t whether they go into recession, but about the depth and length of the downturn. Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, China\u2019s GDP has taken a nosedive from double-digit growth over the past number of years to low single digits at best. Thinking back on my career, first with Dow and hear in Enterprise, I can\u2019t count the number of downturns I\u2019ve been through. At Dow, the downturns were always painful, but here in Enterprise they always bring opportunity. In the current environment, while it\u2019s -- while the uncertainties are real, the certainty that Enterprise will always deliver is real too. Moving to CapEx, year-to-date growth CapEx excluding our Midland Basin acquisition totaled $973 million and our current expectation for growth capital for 2022 and 2023 remains in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We currently have $5.5 billion of organic growth projects under construction and we look forward to bringing our PDH 2 plant, our Frac 12, one plant each in the Midland and Delaware Basins and our TW product system on line in 2023. We\u2019re back on the -- we\u2019ve been traveling domestically since end of 2020, and now we are back on the road traveling internationally. And we are welcome in every country we visit. Brent and some of his folks just spent three weeks traveling across Asia from Japan to Korea to Singapore to Asia, -- I mean India, and I joined them for some meetings in the last week of their trip. In the middle of a prolonged war in Europe, and the outright weaponization of energy by Putin, a global energy and food crisis and inflation worldwide, our country is better positioned than any other, thanks to our abundance of both, energy and agricultural products. Notwithstanding that abundance, the critically low inventories of distillate in the Northeast United States were self-inflicted and could have been completely avoided by temporarily waiving the Jones Act. In our travels executives in other countries no longer ask about the size of U.S. energy resources. They don\u2019t ask about where we think price is headed, or if we feel U.S. supplies will be competitive. Instead, in most meetings, we are asked if our politicians have a clue about the realities of the world\u2019s immediate and longer term needs to U.S. energy. Unfortunately, with a rhetoric that comes from our government and inaction on badly needed permitting reform for pipelines, transmission infrastructure and mining probably answers that question. Our government needs to understand that rhetoric matters. The United Nations has stated that there is a direct correlation between energy consumption per capita and quality of life. Much of India\u2019s population lives in poverty. One of India\u2019s most senior executives reminded me in our meeting that they have access to ample supplies of coal. And without access to U.S. resources, they are going to use any and all available resources to raise the standard of living for their people. Global coal consumption is predicted to hit an all-time high in 2022. And that\u2019s a trend that could continue as Russia natural gas stays shut in. Meanwhile, back in touch with reality, Europe recently declared both, natural gas and nuclear energy as clean energy, resources that will be needed for years to come and Asia continues to make no bones about their long-term appetite for U.S. energy. We at Enterprise have been emphatic that it\u2019s going to take all of the above in order to meet the world\u2019s growing energy needs. That\u2019s why in addition to traditional midstream services, we\u2019re also focused on investments in lower carbon projects, like carbon capture and sequestration, and providing blue ammonia into export markets. U.S. hydrocarbons remain badly needed to support countries who live in poverty -- energy poverty, and to support our closest friends or allies in Europe who are in energy crisis. We currently export about 60 million barrels of oil equivalent every month. It\u2019s clear that the world wants and needs much more of what we have. We\u2019re back on the road traveling domestically, internationally. We\u2019re growing existing relationships and developing new ones and new opportunities. Sorry. I lost my place, Randy.\nRandy Fowler: All right. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Starting with the third quarter income statement, net income attributable to common unitholders for the third quarter of 2022 was $1.4 billion or $0.62 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.2 billion or $0.52 per unit for the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted cash flow from operations, which is net cash flow before operating activities before -- adjusted cash flow from operations is our cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital. For the third quarter of this year it was $2 billion. This is a 13% increase compared to $1.7 billion generated for the third quarter of last year. We declared a distribution of $0.475 per common unit for the third quarter of 2022, which is 5.6% higher than the distribution declared for the third quarter of last year. This distribution will be paid on November 14th to common unitholders of record as of the close of business on October 31st. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million common units at a cost of $95 million. For the first three quarters of this year, we repurchased approximately 5.3 million common units for $130 million. We plan to resume our program to opportunistically buy back up to 350 million of units in the near term. For the 12 months ended September 30, we paid over $4.1 billion of distributions to limited partners and bought back $255 million of common units in the open market. For this period, Enterprise\u2019s payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations was 56% and our payout ratio of the adjusted free cash flow, if you exclude the $3.2 billion Navitas Midstream acquisition, was 70%. In addition, during the third quarter and the first nine months of this year, approximately 1.5 million common units and 4.7 million common units, respectively, were purchased on the open market by our distribution reinvestment and employee unit purchase plans. Total capital investments in the third quarter were $474 million, which includes $397 million for organic growth capital projects and 77 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Capital investments for the first nine months of 2022 were $4.4 billion, which included the $3.2 billion acquisition of Navitas Midstream, $973 million invested for organic growth capital projects and $234 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our total growth projects under construction remains unchanged from last quarter at $5.5 billion. We continue to expect our total 2022 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $1.6 billion and sustaining CapEx to be approximately $350 million. For 2023, we currently expect growth capital investments will be approximately $2.0 billion. Our total debt principal outstanding was $29.5 billion as of September 30, 2022. Assuming the final maturity date for our hybrid notes, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio is approximately 20 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.4%. At September 30th, approximately 93% of our debt was fixed rate. Earlier this year, we retired $1.4 billion of senior notes and redeemed $350 million of variable rate hybrid notes, using a mix of cash proceeds from a note issuance in September 2021, and commercial paper. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $3.3 billion at September 30th, including availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash on hand. With regard to near-term debt maturities, we have $1.25 billion of senior notes maturing in March of 2023. We expect our free cash flow generation and liquidity position will provide ample flexibility regarding the refinancing of these notes. Adjusted EBITDA was $9 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2022. Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.26 times on a gross basis. And if you net out the partial equity treatment for the hybrid notes and reduce debt by unrestricted cash on hand, that number on a net basis was 3.1 times. Given the coordinated efforts by global central banks to increase interest rates to temper inflation and the likelihood of a global recession and just general volatility, we believe that it is prudent to remain at the lower end of our targeted leverage range of 3.25 and 3.75 times EBITDA. Lastly, we published our 2022 sustainability report in September. We encourage you to visit our website and review our discussion on the vital role of U.S. fossil fuels in supporting the pillars of modern civilization and providing a pathway for a better life for 2.5 billion who still live in energy poverty. With that, Randy, I think we can open it up for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Josh, we\u2019re ready to take questions from our listeners. I would like to remind everyone to please restrict your questions to one question and one follow-up please. Go ahead, Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about Permian growth heading into 2023. You had some comments last week from the majors. Obviously you\u2019ve got tight gas takeaway. Do you see that all impacting the pace of growth into \u201823 on the oil side and the gas side, I guess, for the Permian?\nTony Chovanec: Yes. Michael, this is Tony. When we went into this year and at our analyst meeting, we said, given the momentum we have, we thought that year-end 2021 to year-end \u201823 hard to call, which year it would land in, we\u2019d be up to -- and I\u2019m just going with the oil, 1.5 million barrels of increase. Clearly, and you referenced what the majors said, I\u2019ll use Chevron as an example, sort of as a poster child. The supply chain issues in the oilfield and labor issues are not minor. And so, if you look at what Chevron said, they are guiding to the low-end of their production target, particularly as we get to year-end 2022. That said, we\u2019ve got 60 rig increase in the Permian Basin year-to-date. And if you think about what those rigs look like, compared to call it 2019 or 2020, there is some efficiency, some 30% greater, this is not a small number. So, if I were to guess right now, okay, because it\u2019s hard. Yesterday, the August numbers came out from EIA for what it\u2019s worth, and they showed an 100,000 barrel a day increase between July and August. So, I would tell you that I think we are probably an increase -- and that puts us year-to-date increase of between 350,000, 400,000 barrels, depending on which numbers you look at. So, I\u2019m comfortable saying that we are probably going to increase 500,000 to 600,000 barrels in 2022 for the whole U.S. and in 2023 600,000 to 800,000 barrels. So, when you add the two together, 1.2 million to 1.4 million -- and we will address that at the Analyst Meeting again next year, but we\u2019re very comfortable in that range.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thanks for that, Tony. I guess, a related question, clearly, Waha has been -- price has been really -- really weak lately. Curious if you could just speak to how much open gas pipeline capacity you have to capture those spreads and basically how much of that you\u2019ve already hedged? Thanks.\nBrent Secrest: Michael, this is Brent Secrest. If you look at Enterprise\u2019s capacity as it relates to Waha to Gulf Coast markets, we are between 350 million and 400 million a day of open capacity, or just call it outright capacity for Enterprise. And as it stands right now, none of that\u2019s hedged for next year.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to kind of pivot to the petchem business, if you could. And we\u2019ve seen a lot of commentary of the petchems talking about lower operating rates. And it looks like we are headed for a bit of a down cycle here. And you touched on the opening remarks, but just wanted to get a bit more color on what that could mean for EPD specifically here. I think we\u2019ve talked about in the past, maybe this looks like kind of a six to nine-month destocking cycle. Is that still how you see it? And if so, I guess, how would that impact EPD? Do you see like a big step down in petchem services next year or how should we frame the range of outcomes?\nJim Teague: Let me -- Chris, I want to take a shot and give it to you. We don\u2019t have the spreads between RGP and PGP that we had last year. Saying that the spreads we have today are more like what we have traditionally seen. Our octane enhancement business has done well. We\u2019ve got that hedged 75% for next year at good numbers. And then don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re bringing on PDH 2 next year. And then our ethylene and propylene distribution and export and storage facilities are going strong and growing. You want to -- I personally think, yes, it\u2019s going to be -- propylene it\u2019s going to be softer. But I still think we\u2019re going to do pretty good.\nChris D\u2019Anna: Yes. If you look at how we\u2019ve built our splitter business over the years, it\u2019s midstream services where we have a 50% of our margin is fee-based, 25% of our margin is fee-based with the exposure to the spread when it blows out. And certainly that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen over the last year and a half. And then the last 25% is market exposed. So, I think over the next six to nine months, we continue to see weakness in destocking. We\u2019re going to see kind of reversion to what our historical split or profits have been. PDH 2 will add to that.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just wanted to see I guess within this context of how you think about capital allocation here, it seems like we have a bit of choppiness in the credit markets and investors still looking for greater return of capital on the equity side. And just wondering how you think that all shakes out within this background?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Jeremy, this is Randy. Good morning. Jeremy, I think you\u2019ll continue to see us sort of all the above and try to do a combination of distribution growth and buybacks, where it makes sense, again, opportunistically. And then, I think we\u2019re in good shape. We\u2019ve managed our debt maturities very well. We really came in and issued longer term debt. So, our maturity ladder, we don\u2019t have big maturities in any of the years coming up. So, I think we\u2019re in good shape going into 2023 to handle that maturity when it comes due.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And as far as the return of capital to investors, buybacks versus dividend distributions, any change in thought, given\u2026\nRandy Fowler : No change on thought. 2022 marks our 24th year in a row for distribution growth, and we think next year, it\u2019ll be 25 years in distribution growth, so. But still, we\u2019ll come in and do all the above.\nChris Nelly: Jeremy, this is Chris Nelly. The one thing that I would add there is that in talking to a lot of investors given the inflationary environment they\u2019re in, really appreciate the 5.6% distribution growth year-over-year. That\u2019s helpful to a lot of our individual unitholders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Just building on Jeremy\u2019s question again about Dow saying that they\u2019re going to cut polyethylene production by 10% to 15% here. Can you kind of just higher level give us your thoughts on what that means for U.S. ethane production and NGL prices? And if it could kind of touch some other parts of your business like LPG exports or discretionary ethane, that maybe people don\u2019t necessarily expect to be so petchem related?\nJim Teague: I\u2019ll start and then throw it to Brent and Chris, Jean Ann. I\u2019m going to go to LPG exports. We\u2019re [bold] (ph), aren\u2019t we, Brent? So, every month, on ethane exports, we have - I\u2019ve seen us go no less than 5 million barrels a month I\u2019m thinking and up to 7 million barrels a month. So, I think where ethylene and propylene are concerned, to the extent they go lower, I think it opens up export opportunities, more for ethylene and propylene. So, I think those export [docks] (ph) grow in value as prices go down.\nBrent Secrest: Jean Ann on ethane in terms of recoveries, if domestic demand goes down, it\u2019s still pretty strong. Tony, it\u2019s around 1.9\u2026\nTony Chovanec: Correct.\nBrent Secrest: \u2026million barrels a day. So, it\u2019s still hanging in there. But ultimately, there\u2019s going to be a lot of ethane recovered out of the Permian Basin. That\u2019s going to help our Permian Basin NGL lines. On the discretionary ethane, so when you look at Rockies and some other more challenged basins in terms of distance. That\u2019s the barrel that\u2019s going to be on margin, probably for next year. If you look at Enterprise on the ethane business, on the downstream side, I would say there\u2019s probably about 90% of our business that\u2019s take or pay type contracts. So think of the ethane dock and Aegis and ATEX and those type of businesses, all that\u2019s fairly well from a revenue standpoint on solid ground. And then ultimately on LPGs, what we\u2019ve always said is LPGs we\u2019re going to have to price in to get to go clear across the water. So, we\u2019re heavily contracted, we do probably have some open spots when we look in the next year. That will be probably -- have some -- we'll wait and see what happens. But we\u2019ll have some opportunity across our facilities.\nJean Ann Salisbury : And then just following up on one of your comments there. You\u2019d kind of said before that as gas prices widened in Waha, you might start to see like material ethane opportunity, like more ethane being recovered there, maybe 100,000 barrels even. I was just wondering if now that you\u2019re seeing gas price widen, if that ethane is showing up?\nBrent Secrest: Absolutely. If you look across Enterprise, runs their system, what\u2019s going on doesn\u2019t probably affect us as much as it does affect third-party processors. But you\u2019re definitely seeing the effects of it. This month, you saw it toward the end of last month, and we expect to see it probably for the balance of 2023.\nJim Teague: Jean Ann, one more thing. I\u2019m absolutely convinced that some of what we export is being burned, especially in Asia. In fact, I know one company that is when you can land ethane cheaper than LNG, Tony?\nTony Chovanec: Absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: I\u2019m just curious, world\u2019s changed a ton in the last six or nine months, just the cycle. Credit markets starting to get a little choppy out there, especially for some of the smaller entities public or private. Just curious is the M&A landscape, has that yet become more attractive? I know you just did Navitas, but that was kind of before the credit markets got choppy. Just curious how you are thinking about the opportunity to use the balance sheet to gobble up assets?\nJim Teague: I\u2019m thinking that we are building two more plants in the Midland Basin and two more plants in the Delaware Basin, and that\u2019s a more efficient use of capital than going to pay a lot of money. We like the Navitas deal. It\u2019s done real well. But it wasn\u2019t only a good deal, it was a strategic fit. And what bothers some of us, at least me, is I\u2019ve been through a number of second requests and I don\u2019t see anything we could buy and require second request.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. In other words, sellers haven\u2019t gotten to a point, either due to leverage or anything else, where pricing has come down a lot in the market?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Michael, I think it\u2019s more, again, expanding what Jim was saying is really, we just see a lot of organic growth opportunities right now. And when we came in and leading up to the Navitas transaction, we did a pretty deep dive of all the -- at least in the G&P world as far as what the opportunities were. And by far, Navitas checked all the boxes for us. And as Jim said, it\u2019s -- the transition has gone well. The fit has been great. We didn\u2019t have anything in the Midland. And we have been very pleased with it. We continue to look at opportunities, but right now, we are just seeing returns on capital on organic growth.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS. You may proceed.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just to start on the moving pieces in \u201823 CapEx. It seems like Shin Oak has gotten pushed to the first half of \u201825 from \u201824. Kind of curious if you can talk about just the moving pieces in CapEx, what\u2019s potentially still under development and what ultimately could provide some upside or downside to that \u201823 CapEx number of roughly $2 billion?\nRandy Fowler: Brian, this is Randy. I think where we are with 2023 at $2 billion, really it\u2019s hard to see that moving materially higher. We are -- as far as on the only large project that\u2019s out there that we are looking for more clarity is our offshore crude oil export facility, and we are still waiting on permits there. But even with that, it\u2019s hard to see -- as we sit here today, hard to see that number move materially.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. And just a quick follow-up. Is there any fundamental change of view with Shin Oak expansion being pushed back a year?\nJustin Kleiderer: Yes. This is Justin Kleiderer. I don\u2019t think it changes our fundamental view. I think we have a little bit more time to pull the trigger on expansion, we still have the scoped expansion ready to go. We are just spending a little bit more time trying to understand what\u2019s appropriate for what the market needs and when it needs it.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. That\u2019s super helpful. And then maybe just as a broader question, while \u201823 E&P budgets haven\u2019t been formalized, curious if you could just talk about Permian producer customers, what they\u2019re looking at and how they\u2019re thinking about \u201823, just given the expected nat gas tightness, public and private, looking at \u201823 a little bit differently. Do you see flaring, coming back, materially in \u201823 or do you think that\u2019s kind of a thing of the past? And then we could just see more lumpy volumes, while we navigate that nat gas tightness? Thanks.\nTony Chovanec: Brian, I\u2019ll start out. This is Tony. I made the comment at the beginning of this call. If you look at what\u2019s happened to Permian rig counts, it\u2019s not small. So, there is a significant amount of momentum in the Permian. We hear it from publics and privates alike. And quoted some numbers this morning, what we think and how the numbers end up. Could things slow it down, flaring on gas? We go to a lot of things. But, it\u2019s hard to kill this kind of momentum. And Brent, I\u2019ll let you spend a lot of time with producers talk about privates and big privates in public and how you see it.\nBrent Secrest: Brian, I think, when you look at the bigger privates, they still have a fairly robust growth plan. I heard some of the earnings calls last week from some of the larger players in the Permian. And they were a little bit more tempered than what we had heard. But the bigger public company is, more growth that they were talking about. But if you look at our system in the Midland Basin and recognize that we have some of its timing and capital projects, but if you look at our growth on the natural gas side and processing side, it\u2019s probably about 23% growth from \u201822 to \u201823. On the Delaware Basin side, it\u2019s going to be probably call it 7% to 10%. That\u2019s probably a little bit late our timing on our plants. [Ph] And when you look at what producers are looking at, even if, where gas prices are in 2023, I didn\u2019t check it before I came in here, but we\u2019re still around a $3 type number where producers can hedge. And the whole scheme of things that the crude is going to drive somewhere between 85% and 87% of the economics. What the gift that producers were given, when they were able to achieve $4 or $5 type gas prices that\u2019s what it was. It was a gift. I don\u2019t think it changes the mentality in terms of where Waha is trading at, because again, it\u2019s still a pretty healthy number for 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: Tony, I wanted to ask you for an update on how much ethane do you think is still currently being rejected in the Permian from I think the last update was 200,000 to 250,000 barrels per day, and how much can realistically come out?\nTony Chovanec: Yes. That number changes from day-to-day. I\u2019ll pass it to Tug or Brent. But when I say it changes from day-to-day, I mean, it changes from day-to-day. I would think that that rejection number is less because of what\u2019s happened to gas but gas moves. It\u2019s really unbelievable what happens...\nBrent Secrest: There\u2019s probably some older plants out there that can\u2019t recover as much as the newer type plants. I would think everything that can\u2019t be recovered is probably getting recovered. Tug, do you have a volumetric number, what we think is not being recovered, because it probably can\u2019t?\nTug Hanley: If you look at the Waha spread, right now there\u2019s a very healthy incentives obviously for every single plant that can\u2019t recover to recover. But as far as older plants and why it\u2019s probably 50,000 to 75,000 barrels a day that cannot be recovered due to older technology.\nJim Teague: And the spreads they have, I can\u2019t imagine anybody purposely rejecting...\nTheresa Chen: And looking to the petchem side of things. I\u2019m curious to hear your view on your customers in the international markets. Granted from a U.S. perspective is capacity utilization is down here, making the feedstocks cheaper, exports make a lot of sense. But as we look at the international markets and we also are hearing about Far East and European facilities, curtailing production and some prolonged their maintenance because of these poor margin outlooks. And as we think about Europe potentially sending elevated amounts of naphtha to that Singapore market and as a competing feedstock. What does that mean for U.S. Gulf Coast exports of petchem feedstocks internationally?\nChris D\u2019Anna: This is Chris D\u2019Anna. I guess, globally, the whole petchem segment is weak right now. And so what that\u2019s meant to us over the last several months is that our ethylene export dock says has been full. And some months, a product goes to Europe, some months it goes to Asia. And I think all these -- all the petrochemical plants over there are trying to balance out and find the right optimum level to run. But I think the short answer for us is that it means our dock is full, at least for ethylene. And for propylene, we\u2019ve had imports at times we\u2019ve had export at times. So, it\u2019s really creating some opportunities for us.\nJim Teague: I\u2019ve said earlier that ethane docks can stay full and that LPG docks can stay full.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. Thank you.\nJim Teague: Notwithstanding the weakness, we\u2019ve been visiting, like I said in my script, we\u2019ve been traveling internationally and we\u2019ve been visiting among -- countries. But we\u2019ve been visiting with the companies that want to build petrochemical complexes. And our goal is to export ethane to them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: I guess, I want to follow-up on some of the Permian growth expectations. I think you talked about -- Brent I think he said 600,000 to 800,000 barrels a day of -- I think that was U.S. growth for next year. So I guess what would that translate into Permian growth? And then, what about residue gas growth, if you\u2019re going to grow, what\u2019s the equivalent kind of residue gas growth on that \u201823 number?\nTony Chovanec: It\u2019s very, very weighted towards the Permian. Any other increases when we look at oil are relatively small. So, think Permian, I don\u2019t have that split out in front of me, but think Permian. Relative to NGL growth, just a walk -- yes. Relative to residue for every million barrels, think about 3 Bs of gas from a drive standpoint. That\u2019s said -- go ahead, sir. The gas, both on the Midland side and on the Delaware side, I mean, the oil is getting a little gassier. That didn\u2019t mean there is less oil, it just means there is more gas, which is the reason you see us building more plants. That does put producers in a box for 2023 for takeaway at Waha.\nChase Mulvehill: Yes. I guess that was my follow-up question is, how quickly do you think that 1.1 B fills once a PHP and Whistler, those expansions come on line kind of late 3Q or early 4Q. And the follow-up to that would be, do you still have 350 to 400 m a day open for the first half of \u201824 for the FT?\nBrent Secrest: I\u2019ll answer the second question. This is Brent. But, it\u2019s still open in \u201824. Ultimately, those pipelines can\u2019t come on probably fast enough. I think in the daily market, when it comes to Waha, I think we saw it last week and prior to that, when things are this tight, it\u2019s going to be -- and something goes down, it\u2019s going to be incredibly challenging. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the last that we\u2019ve seen negative gas prices in Waha.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Or if something goes up, being the wind blows hard.\nChase Mulvehill: Yes, absolutely already. I\u2019ll turn it back over. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist. You may proceed.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, guys. My first question just on your upcoming projects specifically, when looking to all those projects listed on page 6, I know you\u2019re talking to some of your other midstream and upstream guys that are seeing typical supply chain issues and other various delays out there. I\u2019m just wondering, could you guys give just general comments? You have a lot of fantastic projects coming on, here starting first half of next year. And I\u2019m just wondering if you can give a sense of you feel pretty good about those projects. I mean, obviously, there is a large number of coming on. Maybe it\u2019s just overall color you could give on that.\nGraham Bacon: Yes. This is Graham. Bottom line is we feel real good about these projects. I mean, there are a few still remaining supply chain issues, primarily around electrical gear. I think, we\u2019ve mitigated almost every one of those issues on these projects. So, going forward, we feel really good about execution of these -- of the projects that we have on the list.\nRandy Fowler: Graham, do you want to give a little color on PDH 2?\nGraham Bacon: Yes. Just in light of Randy mentioned PDH 2, still scheduled for mechanical completion in the second quarter of next year. We are looking at -- I think the execution is going very well, looking at coming in under our forecast on that particular project. We are really excited about that. Our teams did a great job back in 2020 mitigating a lot of the supply chain issues that arose during the pandemic. And even through all of that, we are still on schedule and maybe a little bit ahead of budget.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Thank you. That\u2019s good news on PDH 2. I just wanted to clarify on the buybacks. Is the plan still to repurchase the up to 350 million specifically in the second half of the year, or is it more open ended on the timeline for completing that?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, it could spill over into next year. Because, again, we\u2019re looking to come in and do this opportunistically. And, again, we\u2019ll see what the market gives us, a lot of noise out there with the Fed. But, -- yes, so I mean, we\u2019ll see if we can get it done by year-end. If not, we\u2019ll spill over into next year.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. And then just a quick one on the EFS, the Eagle Ford crude contract. The impact in the third quarter, should we think of that as kind of an ongoing impact, so just annualize that number going forward?\nRandy Fowler: So if you look at that contract -- and that\u2019s the life of lease contract. So, what we lost on that is deficiencies. So, we\u2019re still going to get some fees associated with how much production goes up. If you look at the producer around that contract, they have pretty healthy growth plans. So, as more volume comes on in [Technical Difficulty] \u201823 and \u201824, and they\u2019ve shared their growth plans with us, you\u2019re going to see some offset. So I would think that this quarter is probably the worst quarter in terms of impact. If you look at by the end of -- toward the end of the year, we\u2019ll probably make up about 25% of what we lost, and then that number will go up as we go forward.\nRandy Burkhalter: Josh, this is Randy. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Colton Bean with TPH and Company.\nColton Bean: Just one on my end, the natural gas segment had a pretty significant step up in earnings this quarter, but it didn\u2019t look like that was marketing weighted? Can you just walk us through the changes in the intrastate business and whether that\u2019s a sustainable run rate heading into 2023?\nUnidentified Company Representative : Are you asking specifically about our Texas Intrastate System?\nColton Bean: The natural gas segment broadly, but based on the release, it looks like the intrastate was responsible for most of the uplift. So yes, just any changes there?\nUnidentified Company Representative: So, we\u2019ve gotten increased demand or increased contracts from -- volumes from power providers -- also upgraded some of our transport contracts from Waha as well.\nRandy Fowler: I think if you look across our whole natural gas segment and you could go from Haynesville or anywhere around the Permian, you\u2019re going to see increases probably every month as we go forward, Colton. That\u2019s a pretty healthy business right now.\nOperator:\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay. Josh, this is Randy. That would end our call today.

I think, we've mitigated almost every one of those issues on these projects. So, going forward, we feel really good about execution of these -- of the projects that we have on the list. Yes. Just in light of Randy mentioned PDH 2, still scheduled for mechanical completion in the second quarter of next year. We are looking at -- I think the execution is going very well, looking at coming in under our forecast on that particular project. We are really excited about that. Our teams did a great job back in 2020 mitigating a lot of the supply chain issues that arose during the pandemic. And even through all of that, we are still on schedule and maybe a little bit ahead of budget."

            "content": "Yes. If you look at how we've built our splitter business over the years, it's midstream services where we have a 50% of our margin is fee-based, 25% of our margin is fee-based with the exposure to the spread when it blows out. And certainly that's what you've seen over the last year and a half. And then the last 25% is market exposed. So, I think over the next six to nine months, we continue to see weakness in destocking. We're going to see kind of reversion to what our historical split or profits have been. PDH 2 will add to that. This is Chris D'Anna. I guess, globally, the whole petchem segment is weak right now. And so what that's meant to us over the last several months is that our ethylene export dock says has been full. And some months, a product goes to Europe, some months it goes to Asia. And I think all these -- all the petrochemical plants over there are trying to balance out and find the right optimum level to run. But I think the short answer for us is that it means our dock is full, at least for ethylene. And for propylene, we've had imports at times we've had export at times. So, it's really creating some opportunities for us."

            "content": "Yes. Michael, this is Tony. When we went into this year and at our analyst meeting, we said, given the momentum we have, we thought that year-end 2021 to year-end \u201823 hard to call, which year it would land in, we'd be up to -- and I'm just going with the oil, 1.5 million barrels of increase. Clearly, and you referenced what the majors said, I'll use Chevron as an example, sort of as a poster child. The supply chain issues in the oilfield and labor issues are not minor. And so, if you look at what Chevron said, they are guiding to the low-end of their production target, particularly as we get to year-end 2022. That said, we've got 60 rig increase in the Permian Basin year-to-date. And if you think about what those rigs look like, compared to call it 2019 or 2020, there is some efficiency, some 30% greater, this is not a small number. So, if I were to guess right now, okay, because it's hard. Yesterday, the August numbers came out from EIA for what it's worth, and they showed an 100,000 barrel a day increase between July and August. So, I would tell you that I think we are probably an increase -- and that puts us year-to-date increase of between 350,000, 400,000 barrels, depending on which numbers you look at. So, I'm comfortable saying that we are probably going to increase 500,000 to 600,000 barrels in 2022 for the whole U.S. and in 2023 600,000 to 800,000 barrels. So, when you add the two together, 1.2 million to 1.4 million -- and we will address that at the Analyst Meeting again next year, but we're very comfortable in that range. Correct. Absolutely. Brian, I'll start out. This is Tony. I made the comment at the beginning of this call. If you look at what's happened to Permian rig counts, it's not small. So, there is a significant amount of momentum in the Permian. We hear it from publics and privates alike. And quoted some numbers this morning, what we think and how the numbers end up. Could things slow it down, flaring on gas? We go to a lot of things. But, it's hard to kill this kind of momentum. And Brent, I'll let you spend a lot of time with producers talk about privates and big privates in public and how you see it. Yes. That number changes from day-to-day. I'll pass it to Tug or Brent. But when I say it changes from day-to-day, I mean, it changes from day-to-day. I would think that that rejection number is less because of what's happened to gas but gas moves. It's really unbelievable what happens... It's very, very weighted towards the Permian. Any other increases when we look at oil are relatively small. So, think Permian, I don't have that split out in front of me, but think Permian. Relative to NGL growth, just a walk -- yes. Relative to residue for every million barrels, think about 3 Bs of gas from a drive standpoint. That's said -- go ahead, sir. The gas, both on the Midland side and on the Delaware side, I mean, the oil is getting a little gassier. That didn't mean there is less oil, it just means there is more gas, which is the reason you see us building more plants. That does put producers in a box for 2023 for takeaway at Waha."

Kind of curious if you can talk about just the moving pieces in CapEx, what's potentially still under development and what ultimately could provide some upside or downside to that \u201823 CapEx number of roughly $2 billion? Great. And just a quick follow-up. Is there any fundamental change of view with Shin Oak expansion being pushed back a year? Great. That's super helpful. And then maybe just as a broader question, while \u201823 E&P budgets haven't been formalized, curious if you could just talk about Permian producer customers, what they're looking at and how they're thinking about \u201823, just given the expected nat gas tightness, public and private, looking at \u201823 a little bit differently. Do you see flaring, coming back, materially in \u201823 or do you think that's kind of a thing of the past? And then we could just see more lumpy volumes, while we navigate that nat gas tightness?

            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Today, we reported exceptional results for the latest quarter. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 billion for the quarter. We also generated $1.9 billion distributable cash flow, providing 1.8 times coverage. We retained $826 million in DCF, taking us to $2.6 billion for the first nine months. We achieved six operating records, including transporting the record 11.3 million barrels per day of oil equivalent in the form of NGLs, crude oil, natural gas, refined products and petrochemicals. We transported a record of 17.5 trillion Btus per day of natural gas. We also set quarterly volumetric records for NGL fractionation, ethane exports, butane isomerization and fee-based natural gas liquids. Just a minute. I've lost my place. And I won't tell you who I am. Earnings from our Midland Basin natural gas gathering and processing business and higher gross operating margins from our natural gas processing, octane enhancement and natural gas pipeline businesses were particularly exceptional for the quarter. Today, uncertainties in the global economic environment are weighing on the petrochemical industry, where sluggish demand is leading to reduced runs and destocking. There are some serious concerns about recession, especially in Europe, where the question isn't whether they go into recession, but about the depth and length of the downturn. Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, China's GDP has taken a nosedive from double-digit growth over the past number of years to low single digits at best. Thinking back on my career, first with Dow and hear in Enterprise, I can't count the number of downturns I've been through. At Dow, the downturns were always painful, but here in Enterprise they always bring opportunity. In the current environment, while it's -- while the uncertainties are real, the certainty that Enterprise will always deliver is real too. Moving to CapEx, year-to-date growth CapEx excluding our Midland Basin acquisition totaled $973 million and our current expectation for growth capital for 2022 and 2023 remains in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We currently have $5.5 billion of organic growth projects under construction and we look forward to bringing our PDH 2 plant, our Frac 12, one plant each in the Midland and Delaware Basins and our TW product system on line in 2023. We're back on the -- we've been traveling domestically since end of 2020, and now we are back on the road traveling internationally. And we are welcome in every country we visit. Brent and some of his folks just spent three weeks traveling across Asia from Japan to Korea to Singapore to Asia, -- I mean India, and I joined them for some meetings in the last week of their trip. In the middle of a prolonged war in Europe, and the outright weaponization of energy by Putin, a global energy and food crisis and inflation worldwide, our country is better positioned than any other, thanks to our abundance of both, energy and agricultural products. Notwithstanding that abundance, the critically low inventories of distillate in the Northeast United States were self-inflicted and could have been completely avoided by temporarily waiving the Jones Act. In our travels executives in other countries no longer ask about the size of U.S. energy resources. They don't ask about where we think price is headed, or if we feel U.S. supplies will be competitive. Instead, in most meetings, we are asked if our politicians have a clue about the realities of the world's immediate and longer term needs to U.S. energy. Unfortunately, with a rhetoric that comes from our government and inaction on badly needed permitting reform for pipelines, transmission infrastructure and mining probably answers that question. Our government needs to understand that rhetoric matters. The United Nations has stated that there is a direct correlation between energy consumption per capita and quality of life. Much of India's population lives in poverty. One of India's most senior executives reminded me in our meeting that they have access to ample supplies of coal. And without access to U.S. resources, they are going to use any and all available resources to raise the standard of living for their people. Global coal consumption is predicted to hit an all-time high in 2022. And that's a trend that could continue as Russia natural gas stays shut in. Meanwhile, back in touch with reality, Europe recently declared both, natural gas and nuclear energy as clean energy, resources that will be needed for years to come and Asia continues to make no bones about their long-term appetite for U.S. energy. We at Enterprise have been emphatic that it's going to take all of the above in order to meet the world's growing energy needs. That's why in addition to traditional midstream services, we're also focused on investments in lower carbon projects, like carbon capture and sequestration, and providing blue ammonia into export markets. U.S. hydrocarbons remain badly needed to support countries who live in poverty -- energy poverty, and to support our closest friends or allies in Europe who are in energy crisis. We currently export about 60 million barrels of oil equivalent every month. It's clear that the world wants and needs much more of what we have. We're back on the road traveling domestically, internationally. We're growing existing relationships and developing new ones and new opportunities. Sorry. I lost my place, Randy. Let me -- Chris, I want to take a shot and give it to you. We don't have the spreads between RGP and PGP that we had last year. Saying that the spreads we have today are more like what we have traditionally seen. Our octane enhancement business has done well. We've got that hedged 75% for next year at good numbers. And then don't forget, we're bringing on PDH 2 next year. And then our ethylene and propylene distribution and export and storage facilities are going strong and growing. You want to -- I personally think, yes, it's going to be -- propylene it's going to be softer. But I still think we're going to do pretty good. I'll start and then throw it to Brent and Chris, Jean Ann. I'm going to go to LPG exports. We're [bold] (ph), aren't we, Brent? So, every month, on ethane exports, we have - I've seen us go no less than 5 million barrels a month I'm thinking and up to 7 million barrels a month. So, I think where ethylene and propylene are concerned, to the extent they go lower, I think it opens up export opportunities, more for ethylene and propylene. So, I think those export [docks] (ph) grow in value as prices go down. Jean Ann, one more thing. I'm absolutely convinced that some of what we export is being burned, especially in Asia. In fact, I know one company that is when you can land ethane cheaper than LNG, Tony? I'm thinking that we are building two more plants in the Midland Basin and two more plants in the Delaware Basin, and that's a more efficient use of capital than going to pay a lot of money. We like the Navitas deal. It's done real well. But it wasn't only a good deal, it was a strategic fit. And what bothers some of us, at least me, is I've been through a number of second requests and I don't see anything we could buy and require second request. And the spreads they have, I can't imagine anybody purposely rejecting... I've said earlier that ethane docks can stay full and that LPG docks can stay full. Notwithstanding the weakness, we've been visiting, like I said in my script, we've been traveling internationally and we've been visiting among -- countries. But we've been visiting with the companies that want to build petrochemical complexes. And our goal is to export ethane to them."

            "content": "All right. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Starting with the third quarter income statement, net income attributable to common unitholders for the third quarter of 2022 was $1.4 billion or $0.62 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.2 billion or $0.52 per unit for the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted cash flow from operations, which is net cash flow before operating activities before -- adjusted cash flow from operations is our cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital. For the third quarter of this year it was $2 billion. This is a 13% increase compared to $1.7 billion generated for the third quarter of last year. We declared a distribution of $0.475 per common unit for the third quarter of 2022, which is 5.6% higher than the distribution declared for the third quarter of last year. This distribution will be paid on November 14th to common unitholders of record as of the close of business on October 31st. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.9 million common units at a cost of $95 million. For the first three quarters of this year, we repurchased approximately 5.3 million common units for $130 million. We plan to resume our program to opportunistically buy back up to 350 million of units in the near term. For the 12 months ended September 30, we paid over $4.1 billion of distributions to limited partners and bought back $255 million of common units in the open market. For this period, Enterprise's payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations was 56% and our payout ratio of the adjusted free cash flow, if you exclude the $3.2 billion Navitas Midstream acquisition, was 70%. In addition, during the third quarter and the first nine months of this year, approximately 1.5 million common units and 4.7 million common units, respectively, were purchased on the open market by our distribution reinvestment and employee unit purchase plans. Total capital investments in the third quarter were $474 million, which includes $397 million for organic growth capital projects and 77 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Capital investments for the first nine months of 2022 were $4.4 billion, which included the $3.2 billion acquisition of Navitas Midstream, $973 million invested for organic growth capital projects and $234 million for sustaining capital expenditures. Our total growth projects under construction remains unchanged from last quarter at $5.5 billion. We continue to expect our total 2022 growth capital expenditures to be approximately $1.6 billion and sustaining CapEx to be approximately $350 million. For 2023, we currently expect growth capital investments will be approximately $2.0 billion. Our total debt principal outstanding was $29.5 billion as of September 30, 2022. Assuming the final maturity date for our hybrid notes, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio is approximately 20 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.4%. At September 30th, approximately 93% of our debt was fixed rate. Earlier this year, we retired $1.4 billion of senior notes and redeemed $350 million of variable rate hybrid notes, using a mix of cash proceeds from a note issuance in September 2021, and commercial paper. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $3.3 billion at September 30th, including availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash on hand. With regard to near-term debt maturities, we have $1.25 billion of senior notes maturing in March of 2023. We expect our free cash flow generation and liquidity position will provide ample flexibility regarding the refinancing of these notes. Adjusted EBITDA was $9 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2022. Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.26 times on a gross basis. And if you net out the partial equity treatment for the hybrid notes and reduce debt by unrestricted cash on hand, that number on a net basis was 3.1 times. Given the coordinated efforts by global central banks to increase interest rates to temper inflation and the likelihood of a global recession and just general volatility, we believe that it is prudent to remain at the lower end of our targeted leverage range of 3.25 and 3.75 times EBITDA. Lastly, we published our 2022 sustainability report in September. We encourage you to visit our website and review our discussion on the vital role of U.S. fossil fuels in supporting the pillars of modern civilization and providing a pathway for a better life for 2.5 billion who still live in energy poverty. With that, Randy, I think we can open it up for questions. Yes. Jeremy, this is Randy. Good morning. Jeremy, I think you'll continue to see us sort of all the above and try to do a combination of distribution growth and buybacks, where it makes sense, again, opportunistically. And then, I think we're in good shape. We've managed our debt maturities very well. We really came in and issued longer term debt. So, our maturity ladder, we don't have big maturities in any of the years coming up. So, I think we're in good shape going into 2023 to handle that maturity when it comes due. No change on thought. 2022 marks our 24th year in a row for distribution growth, and we think next year, it'll be 25 years in distribution growth, so. But still, we'll come in and do all the above. Yes. Michael, I think it's more, again, expanding what Jim was saying is really, we just see a lot of organic growth opportunities right now. And when we came in and leading up to the Navitas transaction, we did a pretty deep dive of all the -- at least in the G&P world as far as what the opportunities were. And by far, Navitas checked all the boxes for us. And as Jim said, it's -- the transition has gone well. The fit has been great. We didn't have anything in the Midland. And we have been very pleased with it. We continue to look at opportunities, but right now, we are just seeing returns on capital on organic growth. Brian, this is Randy. I think where we are with 2023 at $2 billion, really it's hard to see that moving materially higher. We are -- as far as on the only large project that's out there that we are looking for more clarity is our offshore crude oil export facility, and we are still waiting on permits there. But even with that, it's hard to see -- as we sit here today, hard to see that number move materially. Graham, do you want to give a little color on PDH 2? Yes, it could spill over into next year. Because, again, we're looking to come in and do this opportunistically. And, again, we'll see what the market gives us, a lot of noise out there with the Fed. But, -- yes, so I mean, we'll see if we can get it done by year-end. If not, we'll spill over into next year. So if you look at that contract -- and that's the life of lease contract. So, what we lost on that is deficiencies. So, we're still going to get some fees associated with how much production goes up. If you look at the producer around that contract, they have pretty healthy growth plans. So, as more volume comes on in [Technical Difficulty] \u201823 and \u201824, and they've shared their growth plans with us, you're going to see some offset. So I would think that this quarter is probably the worst quarter in terms of impact. If you look at by the end of -- toward the end of the year, we'll probably make up about 25% of what we lost, and then that number will go up as we go forward. I think if you look across our whole natural gas segment and you could go from Haynesville or anywhere around the Permian, you're going to see increases probably every month as we go forward, Colton. That's a pretty healthy business right now."

            "name": "Brent Secrest",
            "content": "Michael, this is Brent Secrest. If you look at Enterprise's capacity as it relates to Waha to Gulf Coast markets, we are between 350 million and 400 million a day of open capacity, or just call it outright capacity for Enterprise. And as it stands right now, none of that's hedged for next year. Jean Ann on ethane in terms of recoveries, if domestic demand goes down, it's still pretty strong. Tony, it's around 1.9... ...million barrels a day. So, it's still hanging in there. But ultimately, there's going to be a lot of ethane recovered out of the Permian Basin. That's going to help our Permian Basin NGL lines. On the discretionary ethane, so when you look at Rockies and some other more challenged basins in terms of distance. That's the barrel that's going to be on margin, probably for next year. If you look at Enterprise on the ethane business, on the downstream side, I would say there's probably about 90% of our business that's take or pay type contracts. So think of the ethane dock and Aegis and ATEX and those type of businesses, all that's fairly well from a revenue standpoint on solid ground. And then ultimately on LPGs, what we've always said is LPGs we're going to have to price in to get to go clear across the water. So, we're heavily contracted, we do probably have some open spots when we look in the next year. That will be probably -- have some -- we'll wait and see what happens. But we'll have some opportunity across our facilities. Absolutely. If you look across Enterprise, runs their system, what's going on doesn't probably affect us as much as it does affect third-party processors. But you're definitely seeing the effects of it. This month, you saw it toward the end of last month, and we expect to see it probably for the balance of 2023. Brian, I think, when you look at the bigger privates, they still have a fairly robust growth plan. I heard some of the earnings calls last week from some of the larger players in the Permian. And they were a little bit more tempered than what we had heard. But the bigger public company is, more growth that they were talking about. But if you look at our system in the Midland Basin and recognize that we have some of its timing and capital projects, but if you look at our growth on the natural gas side and processing side, it's probably about 23% growth from \u201822 to \u201823. On the Delaware Basin side, it's going to be probably call it 7% to 10%. That's probably a little bit late our timing on our plants. [Ph] And when you look at what producers are looking at, even if, where gas prices are in 2023, I didn't check it before I came in here, but we're still around a $3 type number where producers can hedge. And the whole scheme of things that the crude is going to drive somewhere between 85% and 87% of the economics. What the gift that producers were given, when they were able to achieve $4 or $5 type gas prices that's what it was. It was a gift. I don't think it changes the mentality in terms of where Waha is trading at, because again, it's still a pretty healthy number for 2023. There's probably some older plants out there that can't recover as much as the newer type plants. I would think everything that can't be recovered is probably getting recovered. Tug, do you have a volumetric number, what we think is not being recovered, because it probably can't? I'll answer the second question. This is Brent. But, it's still open in \u201824. Ultimately, those pipelines can't come on probably fast enough. I think in the daily market, when it comes to Waha, I think we saw it last week and prior to that, when things are this tight, it's going to be -- and something goes down, it's going to be incredibly challenging. I don't think that's the last that we've seen negative gas prices in Waha."

Today, we reported record adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 billion for the second quarter and that was driven primarily by higher margins and our octane enhancement business, higher natural gas processing margins and contributions from the Midland Basin assets we recently acquired. Those assets continue to significantly exceed our expectations. We generated a record $2 billion of DCF, excluding proceeds from assets sales providing 1.9 times coverage. We retained $974 million of DCF for the quarter taking us to $1.8 billion for the first six months. We achieved 11 financial records and four operating records and more details outlined in the press release and short, it was a good quarter. In this environment, we're not having any trouble keeping our systems full. Our Permian processing plants are running at capacity. We have two processing plants under construction, one in the Delaware, one in the Midland, and we've approved two more, one in each of those basins. When this build out is complete, we'll have 15 processing plants in the Permian, producing 530,000 barrels a day of liquids, which will take us to 36 processing plants as a company producing over 900,000 barrels a day. We also recently approved a project that expands our Shin Oak NGL pipeline by 275,000 barrels a day. And this is done through partial looping. We now have powerful options as it relates to take away for NGLs out of the Permian. We can close those loops to gain a lot of capacity or we can put Seminole back into NGL service, or we can do both. These projects do not change the CapEx guidance that we have communicated in the past. As we announced in Analyst Day, we're also expanding our systems in the Haynesville, over and above the Gillis Lateral we put into service last year. Our 2.5 BCF a day Haynesville system is unique. It not only reaches into the supply area, but it ties into interstate and LNG corridors but it also reaches into the lucrative Mississippi river industrial corridor, which is hungry for gas. We have significant operations and key basins that consistently represent 65% to 75% of the rigs running in the U.S. We've always focused not just on supply, but also markets. Today, we export 2 million barrels a day of crude oil, NGLs, refined products and petrochemicals. We started building this export position over 25 years ago and the leader of the negotiating team when we did that was the lady named Randa Duncan. That trend continues with the major export expansions we have underway for both ethane and ethylene. In addition, this last Friday, our spot project reached an important milestone with the FES \u2013 FEIS for the terminal put into the federal registry. I think it was in the Wall Street Journal, I read that the past three years we've gone from pandemic to pandemonium, when Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, no one was really surprised. Instead, the surprise to most is that the conflicts like it's going to last a while, the other surprise to most is the magnitude of the impact this war is having on both energy and agriculture. We're all coming to grips with the fact that many things we took for granted have changed. We have suddenly realized that what a just in time world we live in and how quickly prices shoot up when something breaks. We're also learning, some of us relearning about inflation, how strong and insidious it is. Most of our young people have never experienced inflation. Energy is reportedly responsible for over 50% of inflation as it is involved in every aspect of our lives. Add to that the high cost of food and increasing cost of housing. U.S. energy independence is now more valuable than ever. It is clear that Russia has a strangle hold on Europe. And Russia and China appeared to be aligned in policies that are in direct conflict with Western Values. Fortunately, the U.S. has an abundant energy resource. It is the fact that our crude oil, NGLs, LNG cargos are the only short cycle resources the world has left. We have tremendous hydrocarbons potential, but unfortunately it is squandered in the current political climate that is intent on restricting its development. Appalachia alone has over 25 Bcf a day of production upside, that's more than what Europe imports from Russia. However, this potential is unattainable, not by economics or resource, but by massive amounts of laws and regulations that are vague best and consistently applied and consistently. In addition to being the only short cycle resource the world has, our energy is environmentally superior. It's much cleaner because it comes from shale and it's produced here in the U.S. under environmental and safety standards that are second to none, it\u2019s not oil and gas versus renewable debate as so many make it out to be. Enterprise\u2019s view has always been, we are absolutely going to need it all. And what most call energy transition is actually going to be badly needed energy additions that will take place gradually. Oil and gas will be in high demand for decades. People who say otherwise are either extremely naive or have their own agenda. Demonizing fossil fuels, overt restrictions on investments and massive layers of regulation that are designed to keep it in the ground will only creep chaos in the form of ever increasing shortages and high prices. We need to learn from the mistakes of our friends in Europe and avoid risky dependence on unreliable or unfriendly suppliers for our oil and gas or for the materials and equipment needed for cleaner energy. Randy will go into this more, but the proposed mansion legislation is not everything the oil and gas community wanted, but the same will be said by the green movement. It appears to try to strike a balance between clean energy incentives and recognition that continued development of fossil fuels that's needed to ensure energy security and energy reliability. Randy?\nRandy Fowler: All right. Thank you Jim. Good morning. Starting with second quarter income statement items, net income attributable to common unit holders for the second quarter of 2022 was a record $1.4 billion or $0.64 per unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.1 billion or $0.50 per common unit for the second quarter of last year. Turning to cash flows, adjusted cash flow from operations, which is cash flow from operations before changes in working capital, was $2.1 billion for the second quarter, this is a 23% increase compared to $1.7 billion generated for the second quarter of last year. Moving on to distributions and buybacks, we declared a distribution of $0.475 per common unit with respect to the second quarter of 2022. This is 5.6% higher than the distribution that we declared for the second quarter of last year. This distribution will be paid next week on August 12 to common unit holders of record as of the close of business on July 29. During the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 1.4 million common units at a cost of $35 million. For the 12 months into June 30, we returned over $4 billion of distributions to limited partners and $235 million of buybacks. So for the last 12 months, our payout ratio compared to adjusted cash flow from operations was 56%. And our payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow after excluding the acquisition, the $3.2 billion acquisition of Navitas Midstream was a payout ratio was 72%. Turning to capital investments. Total capital investments for the quarter were $383 million, which includes $301 million over organic growth projects and $82 million of sustaining capital expenditures. Capital investments for the first six months of the year were $3.9 billion, which includes $3.2 billion for the Navitas acquisition, $576 million invested in growth capital projects, and $157 million for sustaining capital. As Jim detailed earlier this morning, we announced three new projects in the Permian Basin, two new 300 million cubic feet a day natural gas processing plants, and a 275,000 barrel a day expansion of our NGL pipeline system. With these projects, we now expect 2022 growth capital investments to be approximately $1.6 billion and sustaining capital expenditures to be approximately $350 million. For 2023, we currently expect that our growth capital spending will be $2 billion. Our total debt principal outstanding at the end of the quarter was $29.1 billion. Assuming the final maturity date for the hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio is approximately 21 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.4%. And at June 30, approximately 97% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion. And this includes availability under our credit facilities and $231 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.8 billion for the 12 months ended June 30, 2022, which that yields a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.1 times after adjusting debt for the partial equity credit treatment of our hybrid debt, and also reduced by the partnerships unrestricted cash on hand. On August 1, we provided notice of our intention to redeem $350 million of the $700 million of junior subordinated notes D with a redemption date of August 31, 2022. These hybrid notes that were originally issued in August 2017 are redeemable on or after August 2016. These notes have a fixed rate coupon of 4.875% for the first five years, and then become floating at LIBOR plus call it 3% beginning August 2016. Based on current floating rates, the indicative spot floating rate for this note will now jump to 5.8% making these notes one of our highest cost debt issues, and really our only issue that is redeemable without a premium. Given the forecast that the Fed will increase floating rates by at least another 1% or more, we elected to redeem half of this issuance now using cash on hand and commercial paper to fund the redemption. Considering these notes receive 50% equity credit from the rating agencies in lieu of redeeming the entire $700 million of the notes, we decided to redeem half of the notes at this time. And in addition, we plan to opportunistically buy back up to 300 million of EPD common units over the remainder of the year. Our common units are a more expensive cost of equity versus the cost of the equity embedded in the hybrids. In regard to the proposed Inflation Reduction Act, overall, we have received positive feedback from our customers, especially with regard to the availability of federal leases for oil and gas drilling. Further in our efforts to commercialize a carbon sequestration system with Oxy, we believe the proposed changes to the 45Q credits could be a game changer for post combustion emitting customers. It was harder to come in or more of a challenge to come in and commercialize the carbon sequestration projects and attract these customers when the existing 45Q program was only paying $50 per metric ton and had no direct pay options. With that Randy, I think we can open it up for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay. Thank you, Randy. Victor, we\u2019re ready to take questions from our participants.\nOperator: Sounds good. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nRandy Fowler: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to pick up maybe on that last bit there with regards to carbon capture and 45Q if the bill comes through as advertise lifting it to \u2013 lifting it higher there. Just curious, what type of timeline do you think things could happen, could things be developed? Would this happen in Louisiana before Texas, given Louisiana appears on the verge of gaining Classic well primacy by the end of the year, just trying to scope out what this opportunity set could look like for Enterprise over time?\nCarrie Weaver: Hi, Jeremy, this is Carrie Weaver. I don\u2019t think it matters whether it\u2019s Texas or Louisiana, our announcement with Oxy\u2019s in Texas. And I think the relationship in working with the EPA can bring a project to fruition at the same timeline as in Louisiana if they gain primacy. And I think, we have received very positive feedback from customers as we\u2019ve been discussing the project with them and the complementary collaboration with Oxy. So our goal is to be ready to deploy the project as soon as they\u2019re ready. And we think this new legislation will be very encouraging to bring those decisions and those timelines sooner.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful there. And then just wanted to touch base real quick on the quest for $9 billion of EBITDA. It seems like if you print quarters like this one that should be pretty easy to attain, but just wondering any updated thoughts there?\nJim Teague: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy to attain, Jeremy. We\u2019re just halfway through the year. And my role around here is to worry about everything. So I\u2019m not \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 I\u2019m not high-fiving anybody at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. Just to follow up on some of Jeremy\u2019s comments on the CCUS project. EPD has a lot of opportunities in front of it in terms of large-scale projects, including CCUS, the potential for the cracker. And then in addition the spot export project, assuming regulatory certainty over the coming, back half of the year. Assuming we get the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s pass as it stands, curious the management could just talk about how it\u2019s thinking about priority of projects and perhaps timing of pursuing some of these large-scale projects looking forward? Thanks.\nJim Teague: First of all, we\u2019re not looking at building a cracker. You put a press release out that you\u2019re not looking at it. Next thing it\u2019s on the front page of the Houston Chronicle business section. We have got in the FEIS per spot put in federal registry, but we still got another comment period to go. And I\u2019m looking for Bob. We\u2019ve still got another comment period to go, well, what are we 60-plus thousand comments to date? And another 90-day comment period or something like that.\nRobert Sanders: It\u2019s a 45-day comment period from last Friday. So it should be over by September 12. The last public meeting will be on August 23. And as you aware well in excess of 60,000 comments, Jim.\nJim Teague: So once we get through this, we\u2019re getting that knows how many we\u2019ll have, then you got to slip through those. So I think we got it away \u2013 if we get this thing by the end of the year, I think we\u2019d be lucky. It depends on the environment at the time we get it and what kind of customer base we can get as to where it fits in the priority list.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate the color. And then maybe just to pivot to capital allocation. You\u2019re looking to exit 2022 and 2023 well below the three, five target. Given the distribution rate this quarter and the small buyback, just curious if you could provide some incremental color on how we should be thinking about preferences for return of capital as we head into the back half of 2022 and into 2023, also given just higher inflation, et cetera? Thanks.\nJim Teague: Yes, Brian, really our thoughts are still coming in and take all the above approach and that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s reflected by what we\u2019re doing on these \u2013 calling these part of this hybrid note issue. I mean, it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s not the highest coupon, but it\u2019s near the highest coupon debt we have within the other side of it is we\u2019re looking to come in and buy back up to $325 million, $350 million of equity between now and the end of the year, too. So a balanced approach between buybacks and debt reduction. I think the other thing, and again, I think this was represented what we did in 2021 is we came in and retained cash and really have been self-sufficient in funding our growth CapEx. But the other thing we had coming into the year is, we almost we had quite a bit of cash on hand and that enabled us to come in and fund a substantial amount of our acquisition of Navitas Midstream with cash and gave us the flexibility that the remainder that we could come in and just use commercial paper. So again, I think coming in and retaining cash for balance sheet flexibility paid off and how we came in and we\u2019re able to capture opportunities that we didn\u2019t come in and stress the balance sheet by coming in and doing an acquisition. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see much change for us. You did see us come in also this time and bump the distribution 5.6% compared to last year. So again, I think you still come in and see us taking all the above approach.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Appreciate the commentary and enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line \u2013 from Theresa Chen from Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. Jim, I wanted to go back to your comments earlier about the need for incremental NGL takeaway out of the Permian and your FID expansion of Chinook today. Can you just help us understand the puts and takes as to the relative economics of the Chinook expansion versus putting Seminole back into NGL service? And for the looping on Chinook, do you have the permitting in place for multiple wind right away? Or do you still have to get through some of that?\nJim Teague: Well, Justin, you want to take it or Brent, which on these?\nJustin Kleiderer: Yes. I\u2019ll take it. Yes, so I think the Jim\u2019s point, the expansion was \u2013 is clearly supported by the growth in the Permian that we\u2019re seeing supported by our GMP expansions. And I think what really drove the decision in this direction was just preserving that optionality of what we do with some of those repurposing options that we have. There\u2019s a lot of production growth that we expect coming out of the basin in the next three to five years. So that preserving that the value of a potential Seminole conversion for a later decision made, drove us to make this decision.\nTony Chovanec: Yes, this is Tony. I\u2019m going to add to something to that Theresa. Between now and 2027, we \u2013 can you hear me? Between now and 2027, we estimate that liquids out of the Permian Basin grow about 1 million barrels a day. If you look at what they\u2019ve grown year-to-date, and you can\u2019t find these numbers in anything, because EIA is reported in May and any other commercial reporters that do it, have only reported through April. But we think NGLs have grown already 125,000 barrels a day. I think natural gas is about 900, maybe even a little more. Those are big numbers, but I\u2019ll have to tell you that. And you\u2019ve heard it on these calls before. It\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing on our systems. You\u2019re seeing it in the basis market in natural gas, and you\u2019re seeing it on in our fracs and you\u2019re seeing it in our plants, which is the reason for this announcement this morning in the customers backing all that. So getting to \u2013 putting some numbers behind what Justin said, that\u2019s how we see it.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you. And maybe as a follow-up to that, Tony, in light of the Ford basis for the Ford Waha [ph] basis, indicating that we may face a dire situation for residue gas takeaway to your point about incremental nat gas growth. So if we do face that situation in the first half of 2023, can you remind us how much incremental ethane recovery you think is realistic out of the basin? And in general, how do you expect the industry to work through this?\nJim Teague: Let's talk about basis first, if you've watched the basis or whether you watch it on the ice or through brokers next summer has moved out to minus $2. It wasn't long ago that that was minus $1 or $1.20. So that tells you the pressure that the producer community is seeing from just incremental supplies. Relative to ethane somebody, how much ethane we think is being rejected in the Permian, I don't think it's\u2026\nRandy Burkhalter: It\u2019s probably somewhere around 200,000 to 250,000 barrels a day, depends on the month. \nJim Teague: Keep that wider basis once you extract that ethane, because it is a BTU. Yes, sure, absolutely. You can do everything you can to get your gas out because you're protecting your oil barrels.\nRandy Fowler: But then that creates a situation for NGL pipelines. And so that's how that market will balance. \nJim Teague: Theresa did that answer your question?\nTheresa Chen: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question come from line of Colton Bean from TPHC. Go ahead your line is open.\nColton Bean: Good morning. So looks like total spend increased by about $900 million or so between 2022 and 2023. I guess, is that solely attributable to the new processing in Shin Oak capacity? And then if so, are you seeing any material price pressures or alternatively, are you having to build more gathering relative to what was required for the previous round of plants?\nJim Teague: Colton, I'll take the first part of that and then I'll let Graham handle as far as what we're seeing, as far as any cost creep on existing projects. But now what we had said earlier was call it $1.5 billion or so of growth projects for 2023. And now we've seen that grow to about $2 billion and that's really just reflective of some of these project announcements that we had this morning. \nGrahamBacon: In terms of on the project cost increases, we are seeing some increases, particularly the latter half of the year. I think we were pretty solid earlier in the year. We've seen cost increases anywhere from 10% to 15% depending on the type of material used in the project. We are starting to see some softening in some markets particularly steel seems to be turning around. Although labor markets are going to still be still be strong and have some upward pressure on cost as we go forward into 2023.\nColton Bean: And Graham, as far as budget and status of our largest project PDH?\nGraham Bacon: As far as PDH, PDH 2 we're still on track on, on time, on budget. All of our costs were effectively locked in at the time we did that project. So we don't really see any escalation on PDH 2.\nColton Bean: Maybe Randy, just to clarify on the approved project specifically after 2023, going from something that maybe close to $1 billion, up to maybe closer to 2018, 2019 today, is that accurate?\nRandy Fowler: We were estimating, I think we backed at our Investor Day back in March, we said that our expectation was that growth CapEx would be in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion area. And then again, some of that was going to move from, they were projects under development and now you're just coming in and seeing some of those projects being announced.\nColton Bean: Understood then maybe shifting over to frac margins, I think Q4 and Q1 had a pretty significant increase. Looks like you all reported nearly $0.05 a gallon. And then in this quarter had a bit of a pullback closer to Q3 levels. So I guess just moving forward, do you characterize Q2 as more indicative of what you're looking at in the back half of the year? Or could we see a bit of a rebound there?\nRandy Fowler: And Colton, are you really saying natural gas processing margins? Is that what you're referring to?\nColton Bean: Specifically on the now your fractionation fleet, I think you guys reported $201 million or so for this quarter in fractionation specifically. And I think Q4 and Q1 had a pretty, pretty impressive margins there on a unit basis, so just looking at your unit margins for fractionation specifically not frac spread on the processing side?\nRandy Fowler: Who is taking that?\nJim Teague: Zach want to take it?\nZach Strait: Yeah, this is Zach. I think on a go forward basis for the remainder of this year, I think it looks more like this last quarter, couple of things have happened. Power costs have gone up and also the blending at the fracs is also compressed. I think Q4 and Q1 were higher than normal.\nColton Bean: Okay. And on the power side is most of that pass-through or you retaining some of that exposure on at the EPD level?\nZach Strait: It's sort of a pass through we have a little bit of exposure to it and then just how much we have hedge relative to that exposure as well.\nColton Bean: Got it. Appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will line of Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey I think this may have been me good morning, everybody. So I guess thinking about Navitas in the natural gas processing and NGL marketing business, obviously, you inherited a lot more commodity exposure when you acquired Navitas. So really, I guess maybe a couple of questions around this is, is this really kind of one. I don't know if you can kind of help us understand the commodity sensitivities within the natural gas processing in NGO marketing business. And then also talk a little bit about the Waha Basis, I think somebody mentioned it earlier but have you hedged that, do you have a lot of risk around that? I mean, so just kind of help us understand whatever risk you may or may not have if Waha Basis does blow out at some point next year?\nJim Teague: Chase, this Jim one of the reasons we bought the Navitas is frankly, we wanted that commodity exposure given our fairly bullish sentiment. And what was the other part of the question? \nRandy Fowler: I think the only place looking at Waha Basis exposure do we have..\nJim Teague: I think we probably have 300 million a day of exposure and that's on purpose and I don't think we've hedged any of that, that I'm aware of as good.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. All right. Unrelated follow-up. There's a lot of talk on the call today about retiring debt and obviously interest rates continue to move higher. So when we think about your target is 3.5% leverage ratio is there any chance that you think about lowering that at some point, if interest rates continue to kind of rise over the next year or two?\nJim Teague: Chase I think we're \u2013 at this point we're still comfortable with the 3.5 times debt-to-EBIDA plus or minus a quarter, either side. So 3.25 to 3.75. I think one of the keys there is that again, at the end of the quarter, 97% of that debt was fixed and the average life was 21 years. So our exposure to floating debt and an increase interest costs are really, really low. We've been preparing for this environment for a dozen years.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. Right. Perfect. I'll turn it back over. Thanks everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will comes from line of Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi, good morning. I just have one. Year-to-date per Permian pipes to Corpus have been flowing at very high utilizations much higher than those going to Houston. Can you comment on the drivers of this? And if you expect this to kind of stay around until the Houston ship channel is expanded or maybe spot starts?\nBrent Secrest: Hey Jean, this is Brent. I think there's been a lot more crude export in Corpus and I think that's starting to change, but it's a function of the pipeline capacity, that's one of that direction minus the local demand there, and everything else is going to head to the water. It's a function of the pipeline capacity, that's pointed that direction minus the local demand there, and everything else is going to head to the water.  They can load larger ships than us. They can do it at higher rates. I think you've seen some flows change as win [indiscernible] has started up as more barrels are pointed toward Houston. They're taken from some pipes in Corpus, they're taken from others, but ultimately I think once spot goes forward that will change the flow patterns for crude oil exports.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great, thanks. That's all for me.\nOperator: Thank you. Hold on for our next question. Our next question will come from line of Neal Dingmann from Truist. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is [indiscernible] in for Neil Dingman. First question maybe it might be too simplistic, but why not just buy units back given to current, roughly 7.13% yield versus your filing this morning, suggesting the rejection of the notes that at roughly 6% yield?\nRandy Fowler: Yeah, it's really just taking a balanced approach. I mean, we're coming in and the way we're thinking about it is, we're redeeming $350 million of debt, and we're redeeming $350 million of common units. And the coming in and redeeming $350 million of the hybrids is not a levering event, we\u2019re buying the units back is a levering event, but again, it's just still all the above balanced approach.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Great. Thank you. That's it for me.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Blum: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to just put a finer point on the discussion around the distribution. So clearly, if you look at the last, I think at least two years, maybe longer, you've done one increase in the fourth quarter. Obviously, this is sort of a new or out of pattern. So just wanted to understand, is this a new pattern? Is this a one-time event? Is this a step change in growth rate? Just want to make sure I understand that better.\nJim Teague: Yes. I mean, Michael, the board comes in and takes a look at the distribution rate every quarter. I want to say we went through a period, call it 2017 to 2021 where we were really \u2013 or 2020, really, where we were coming in and trying to make a shift in a financial model. And the old model was where you finance of substantial amount of your growth capital expenditures in the capital markets with a pretty good reliance on the equity capital markets. And the pivot that we began to make in 2017 was to come in and be more self-sufficient and coming in and funding our growth capital investments. And so that was \u2013 we were more deliberate on distribution growth and I think that's paid off. This year, I think one of the differences in this year \u2013 and then we've worked through the pandemic too, pandemic question mark, but the business has performed very well. We came in earlier this year and made in an attractive acquisition and that we talked about that being accretive. So that provided us an opportunity to come in and do a mid-year increase in the distribution and in light of what was going on from an inflation standpoint, we thought it made sense to do a midyear boost. I don't know if this is necessarily going to change what we do going forward, but we take a look at it every quarter, but we thought it was appropriate this quarter to go ahead and do a midyear bump.\nMichael Blum: Okay, great. That makes sense. Thanks for that. Also just one, had kind of a macro question. Jim, in your opening comments, you referenced inflation, higher interest rates, higher commodity prices. My question is, are you seeing any signs of weakness and demand across your business segments due to these factors? I know that's kind of like an open ended question, but I'm basically just kind of probing to see if we're seeing any signs of economic weakness in the\u2026\nJim Teague: Hang on Tony, I was with some customer last night who has a number of convenience stores and his read is, and they got more data on than you can say, grace over and his read good say he wasn't seeing that much, he seen some but not that much at the service station. Tony?\nTony Chovanec: Yes. If you look at the data, it's yoyo to little bit in the \u2013 we were down a small amount, call it 5%, but when you listen to scope, call that was about a million barrels, but when you listen to the calls from somebody like Valero and PBF, they're definitive, that their wholesale demand is great, not just for diesel, but for gasoline too. So kind reflected in the frac spread, isn't it?\nJim Teague: It is kind of reflected in the frac spread. You see some weakness in some of the elephant's markets, ethylene is overproduced now, and those plants are taken economic run cuts. You see PDH is going down in China, but I will tell you the flip side to that for Enterprise and Brent, tell me if I'm wrong, but if we don't export ethylene, we're going to export ethane, the demand for our ethane terminal's been phenomenal.\nBrent Secrest: Yes. We're seeing record numbers, especially this month. And I think what we'll see going forward, if you looked across our ethane export we did a record number in July. If you look across our LPG dock, it's incredibly strong. We talked about crude exports. On the export docks, it's really picked up the last couple months, Michael.\nJim Teague: Also, this is Jim. Tony spoke to overproducing ethylene that hurts the merchant player. The integrate is still making money, ethane into polyethylene.\nRandy Fowler: Michael, the world is short, MMBtus in a good way for the world. And because of the natural gas situation, a good way for them to get more MMBtus is an ethane, propane and butane. So it's just the facts.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thanks for all that. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. I had two questions on the good results with the second quarter. First, on NGL marketing, it was up about $50 million Q2 versus Q1. It's a pretty high number. I usually think of NGL marketing is a little weaker seasonally in Q2. So anything in particular driving the strength in marketing there?\nJim Teague: One of the things is a lot of what marketing does is fixed \u2013 all of the exports of, I think about LNG, those contracts are held by marketing, and I'm not sure about ethane. I think those are too, and I'm not sure about ethylene. Chris, is that held by marketing?\nChris D\u2019Anna: No, it's in PetChem.\nJim Teague: If you look at some of the structural things that were going on the market between first quarter and second quarter, especially on the NGL side, that's why the second quarter was so strong.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. And then similar question on processing. So obviously a very strong Q2 number there, headline frac spreads, which you'd usually look at for Enterprise were down in Q2. So not sure if there's a lag effect there or is it just Navitas is more POP and you're just seeing so much strength there that it's kind of overwhelming and bringing processing up.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Keith, I think part of it is we only had Navitas from February 22 or so in the first quarter. And then we got a full contribution from Navitas in the second quarter, but it does have a fee based floor ballpark, I want to say from a commodity exposure again, it's got a fee based floor, but we probably picked up an incremental 22,000 barrels a day of NGLs, another 3,000 or 4,000 barrels a day of condensate and probably 75 million, 80 million cubic feet a day of natural gas exposure. So that really provided some uplift.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. Thank you.\nJim Teague: Victor, we have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: All right. Our last question, one moment. Our last question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is open. You might be on mute. All right, we'll go to the next person. Our next question come from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMichael Lapides: Hey guys, congrats on a good quarter. And thank you for taking my question, really a longer term one. When I think about the asset portfolio of EPD, you are the big dominant player in crude and NGL exports. One of the places where you're not really involved in is in the LNG business. Just curious, is that simply due to that fact that others moved much quicker than you guys did? Is that because you don't think it's an attractive business or is it a just evaluation and call? Just curious about how you think about longer term, your role in kind of the export of natural gas in the U.S. or from the U.S.?\nJim Teague: I think our role would be focused on crude, petrochemicals and natural gas liquids. I think we \u2013 if anything, we miss the boat on LNG.\nRandy Fowler: And on the quicker part, I don't know about the quicker part. I think that was an election that we made. And if we sort of go back in the history books, it was really LNG imports. And we were not a believer in LNG imports. And we just felt like the U.S. was going to have a good resource base. And U.S. LNG would be the first one to turn off as far as imports. And it was really the importers that really became the exporters when their import business model fell apart. And they had first mover advantage to come in and convert to LNG exporters and then, they were there because they already had sunk capital and they already had sunk equipment. So it was very easy for them to come in and do conversions. So really it was \u2013 are not being involved in the LNG imports, to a degree, put us at a disadvantage compared to those incumbent.\nJim Teague: We are involved in delivering gas to export facilities, Gillis Lateral. And I think if I'm not mistaken, our expansion will be \u2013 have the capability.\nMichael Lapides: Got it.\nJim Teague: We love our position, exporting NGLs, crude oil and petrochemicals. And I said in my script, we're exporting just over 2 million barrels a day. That's not too bad.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay. Victor, we're ready to end the call. And so with that, the company will sign off and we'd like to thank everybody for joining us. And Victor, if you would give our participants replay information.\nOperator: Awesome. Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

We are starting to see some softening in some markets particularly steel seems to be turning around. Although labor markets are going to still be still be strong and have some upward pressure on cost as we go forward into 2023. As far as PDH, PDH 2 we're still on track on, on time, on budget.

And I think what really drove the decision in this direction was just preserving that optionality of what we do with some of those repurposing options that we have. There's a lot of production growth that we expect coming out of the basin in the next three to five years. So that preserving that the value of a potential Seminole conversion for a later decision made, drove us to make this decision."

Between now and 2027, we estimate that liquids out of the Permian Basin grow about 1 million barrels a day. If you look at what they've grown year-to-date, and you can't find these numbers in anything, because EIA is reported in May and any other commercial reporters that do it, have only reported through April. But we think NGLs have grown already 125,000 barrels a day. I think natural gas is about 900, maybe even a little more. Those are big numbers, but I'll have to tell you that. And you've heard it on these calls before. It's what we're seeing on our systems. You're seeing it in the basis market in natural gas, and you're seeing it on in our fracs and you're seeing it in our plants, which is the reason for this announcement this morning in the customers backing all that. So getting to \u2013 putting some numbers behind what Justin said, that's how we see it. Yes. If you look at the data, it's yoyo to little bit in the \u2013 we were down a small amount, call it 5%, but when you listen to scope, call that was about a million barrels, but when you listen to the calls from somebody like Valero and PBF, they're definitive, that their wholesale demand is great, not just for diesel, but for gasoline too. So kind reflected in the frac spread, isn't it?"

            "name": "Jim Teague",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Today, we reported record adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 billion for the second quarter and that was driven primarily by higher margins and our octane enhancement business, higher natural gas processing margins and contributions from the Midland Basin assets we recently acquired. Those assets continue to significantly exceed our expectations. We generated a record $2 billion of DCF, excluding proceeds from assets sales providing 1.9 times coverage. We retained $974 million of DCF for the quarter taking us to $1.8 billion for the first six months. We achieved 11 financial records and four operating records and more details outlined in the press release and short, it was a good quarter. In this environment, we're not having any trouble keeping our systems full. Our Permian processing plants are running at capacity. We have two processing plants under construction, one in the Delaware, one in the Midland, and we've approved two more, one in each of those basins. When this build out is complete, we'll have 15 processing plants in the Permian, producing 530,000 barrels a day of liquids, which will take us to 36 processing plants as a company producing over 900,000 barrels a day. We also recently approved a project that expands our Shin Oak NGL pipeline by 275,000 barrels a day. And this is done through partial looping. We now have powerful options as it relates to take away for NGLs out of the Permian. We can close those loops to gain a lot of capacity or we can put Seminole back into NGL service, or we can do both. These projects do not change the CapEx guidance that we have communicated in the past. As we announced in Analyst Day, we're also expanding our systems in the Haynesville, over and above the Gillis Lateral we put into service last year. Our 2.5 BCF a day Haynesville system is unique. It not only reaches into the supply area, but it ties into interstate and LNG corridors but it also reaches into the lucrative Mississippi river industrial corridor, which is hungry for gas. We have significant operations and key basins that consistently represent 65% to 75% of the rigs running in the U.S. We've always focused not just on supply, but also markets. Today, we export 2 million barrels a day of crude oil, NGLs, refined products and petrochemicals. We started building this export position over 25 years ago and the leader of the negotiating team when we did that was the lady named Randa Duncan. That trend continues with the major export expansions we have underway for both ethane and ethylene. In addition, this last Friday, our spot project reached an important milestone with the FES \u2013 FEIS for the terminal put into the federal registry. I think it was in the Wall Street Journal, I read that the past three years we've gone from pandemic to pandemonium, when Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, no one was really surprised. Instead, the surprise to most is that the conflicts like it's going to last a while, the other surprise to most is the magnitude of the impact this war is having on both energy and agriculture. We're all coming to grips with the fact that many things we took for granted have changed. We have suddenly realized that what a just in time world we live in and how quickly prices shoot up when something breaks. We're also learning, some of us relearning about inflation, how strong and insidious it is. Most of our young people have never experienced inflation. Energy is reportedly responsible for over 50% of inflation as it is involved in every aspect of our lives. Add to that the high cost of food and increasing cost of housing. U.S. energy independence is now more valuable than ever. It is clear that Russia has a strangle hold on Europe. And Russia and China appeared to be aligned in policies that are in direct conflict with Western Values. Fortunately, the U.S. has an abundant energy resource. It is the fact that our crude oil, NGLs, LNG cargos are the only short cycle resources the world has left. We have tremendous hydrocarbons potential, but unfortunately it is squandered in the current political climate that is intent on restricting its development. Appalachia alone has over 25 Bcf a day of production upside, that's more than what Europe imports from Russia. However, this potential is unattainable, not by economics or resource, but by massive amounts of laws and regulations that are vague best and consistently applied and consistently. In addition to being the only short cycle resource the world has, our energy is environmentally superior. It's much cleaner because it comes from shale and it's produced here in the U.S. under environmental and safety standards that are second to none, it's not oil and gas versus renewable debate as so many make it out to be. Enterprise's view has always been, we are absolutely going to need it all. And what most call energy transition is actually going to be badly needed energy additions that will take place gradually. Oil and gas will be in high demand for decades. People who say otherwise are either extremely naive or have their own agenda. Demonizing fossil fuels, overt restrictions on investments and massive layers of regulation that are designed to keep it in the ground will only creep chaos in the form of ever increasing shortages and high prices. We need to learn from the mistakes of our friends in Europe and avoid risky dependence on unreliable or unfriendly suppliers for our oil and gas or for the materials and equipment needed for cleaner energy. Randy will go into this more, but the proposed mansion legislation is not everything the oil and gas community wanted, but the same will be said by the green movement. It appears to try to strike a balance between clean energy incentives and recognition that continued development of fossil fuels that's needed to ensure energy security and energy reliability. Randy? I don't think it's easy to attain, Jeremy. We're just halfway through the year. And my role around here is to worry about everything. So I'm not \u2013 we're not \u2013 I'm not high-fiving anybody at this point. First of all, we're not looking at building a cracker. You put a press release out that you're not looking at it. Next thing it's on the front page of the Houston Chronicle business section. We have got in the FEIS per spot put in federal registry, but we still got another comment period to go. And I'm looking for Bob. We've still got another comment period to go, well, what are we 60-plus thousand comments to date? And another 90-day comment period or something like that. So once we get through this, we're getting that knows how many we'll have, then you got to slip through those. So I think we got it away \u2013 if we get this thing by the end of the year, I think we'd be lucky. It depends on the environment at the time we get it and what kind of customer base we can get as to where it fits in the priority list. Yes, Brian, really our thoughts are still coming in and take all the above approach and that's \u2013 I think that's reflected by what we're doing on these \u2013 calling these part of this hybrid note issue. I mean, it's really \u2013 it's not the highest coupon, but it's near the highest coupon debt we have within the other side of it is we're looking to come in and buy back up to $325 million, $350 million of equity between now and the end of the year, too. So a balanced approach between buybacks and debt reduction. I think the other thing, and again, I think this was represented what we did in 2021 is we came in and retained cash and really have been self-sufficient in funding our growth CapEx. But the other thing we had coming into the year is, we almost we had quite a bit of cash on hand and that enabled us to come in and fund a substantial amount of our acquisition of Navitas Midstream with cash and gave us the flexibility that the remainder that we could come in and just use commercial paper. So again, I think coming in and retaining cash for balance sheet flexibility paid off and how we came in and we're able to capture opportunities that we didn't come in and stress the balance sheet by coming in and doing an acquisition. So I don't think you'll see much change for us. You did see us come in also this time and bump the distribution 5.6% compared to last year. So again, I think you still come in and see us taking all the above approach. Well, Justin, you want to take it or Brent, which on these? Let's talk about basis first, if you've watched the basis or whether you watch it on the ice or through brokers next summer has moved out to minus $2. It wasn't long ago that that was minus $1 or $1.20. So that tells you the pressure that the producer community is seeing from just incremental supplies. Relative to ethane somebody, how much ethane we think is being rejected in the Permian, I don't think it's... Keep that wider basis once you extract that ethane, because it is a BTU. Yes, sure, absolutely. You can do everything you can to get your gas out because you're protecting your oil barrels. Theresa did that answer your question? Colton, I'll take the first part of that and then I'll let Graham handle as far as what we're seeing, as far as any cost creep on existing projects. But now what we had said earlier was call it $1.5 billion or so of growth projects for 2023. And now we've seen that grow to about $2 billion and that's really just reflective of some of these project announcements that we had this morning. Zach want to take it? Chase, this Jim one of the reasons we bought the Navitas is frankly, we wanted that commodity exposure given our fairly bullish sentiment. And what was the other part of the question? I think we probably have 300 million a day of exposure and that's on purpose and I don't think we've hedged any of that, that I'm aware of as good. Chase I think we're \u2013 at this point we're still comfortable with the 3.5 times debt-to-EBIDA plus or minus a quarter, either side. So 3.25 to 3.75. I think one of the keys there is that again, at the end of the quarter, 97% of that debt was fixed and the average life was 21 years. So our exposure to floating debt and an increase interest costs are really, really low. We've been preparing for this environment for a dozen years. Yes. I mean, Michael, the board comes in and takes a look at the distribution rate every quarter. I want to say we went through a period, call it 2017 to 2021 where we were really \u2013 or 2020, really, where we were coming in and trying to make a shift in a financial model. And the old model was where you finance of substantial amount of your growth capital expenditures in the capital markets with a pretty good reliance on the equity capital markets. And the pivot that we began to make in 2017 was to come in and be more self-sufficient and coming in and funding our growth capital investments. And so that was \u2013 we were more deliberate on distribution growth and I think that's paid off. This year, I think one of the differences in this year \u2013 and then we've worked through the pandemic too, pandemic question mark, but the business has performed very well. We came in earlier this year and made in an attractive acquisition and that we talked about that being accretive. So that provided us an opportunity to come in and do a mid-year increase in the distribution and in light of what was going on from an inflation standpoint, we thought it made sense to do a midyear boost. I don't know if this is necessarily going to change what we do going forward, but we take a look at it every quarter, but we thought it was appropriate this quarter to go ahead and do a midyear bump. Hang on Tony, I was with some customer last night who has a number of convenience stores and his read is, and they got more data on than you can say, grace over and his read good say he wasn't seeing that much, he seen some but not that much at the service station. Tony? It is kind of reflected in the frac spread. You see some weakness in some of the elephant's markets, ethylene is overproduced now, and those plants are taken economic run cuts. You see PDH is going down in China, but I will tell you the flip side to that for Enterprise and Brent, tell me if I'm wrong, but if we don't export ethylene, we're going to export ethane, the demand for our ethane terminal's been phenomenal. Also, this is Jim. Tony spoke to overproducing ethylene that hurts the merchant player. The integrate is still making money, ethane into polyethylene. One of the things is a lot of what marketing does is fixed \u2013 all of the exports of, I think about LNG, those contracts are held by marketing, and I'm not sure about ethane. I think those are too, and I'm not sure about ethylene. Chris, is that held by marketing? If you look at some of the structural things that were going on the market between first quarter and second quarter, especially on the NGL side, that's why the second quarter was so strong. Victor, we have time for one more question, please. I think our role would be focused on crude, petrochemicals and natural gas liquids. I think we \u2013 if anything, we miss the boat on LNG. We are involved in delivering gas to export facilities, Gillis Lateral. And I think if I'm not mistaken, our expansion will be \u2013 have the capability. We love our position, exporting NGLs, crude oil and petrochemicals. And I said in my script, we're exporting just over 2 million barrels a day. That's not too bad."

It's a function of the pipeline capacity, that's pointed that direction minus the local demand there, and everything else is going to head to the water.  They can load larger ships than us. They can do it at higher rates. I think you've seen some flows change as win [indiscernible] has started up as more barrels are pointed toward Houston. They're taken from some pipes in Corpus, they're taken from others, but ultimately I think once spot goes forward that will change the flow patterns for crude oil exports. Yes. We're seeing record numbers, especially this month. And I think what we'll see going forward, if you looked across our ethane export we did a record number in July.

And so, with that, I'll turn it over to you, Jim.\nJim Teague: Thank you, Randy. I\u2019ve got two numbers to start off with: $2.3 billion in EBITDA, 1.8 times distribution coverage, I think that says it all. Looking back, it seems like the first quarter of each of the last three years has been a quarter of events. First quarter 2020 COVID-19 shut everything down and we had too much of everything everywhere and our people did pretty good. Last year in the first quarter of 2021, Winter Storm Uri wreaked havoc on the entire State of Texas, shutting in production like we've never seen, our folks did pretty good. And then in late February of this year, the world rather suddenly found itself dealing with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and dealing with having to supplement Russian energy to our allies in Europe, along with coming to grips with the growing importance of energy security. In all three scenarios, pandemic, massive weather events and a sudden global energy shortage, our people delivered. If for some reason you missed our analyst meeting, we announced seven new projects. And going into that analyst meeting, notwithstanding the invasion of Ukraine, we were bullish from both a supply and demand perspective for U.S. oil natural gas and NGOs, and we're planning for growth. During our meeting, we announced seven growth projects related to both supply and demand. We're going to build our sixth processing plant in the Midland Basin. That's the assets we bought from Navitas. In the Delaware, we're going to build our second plant at Mentone. In Louisiana, we're expanding our Acadian Haynesville natural gas pipeline by 400 million cubic foot a day. In Texas, we're reversing our Chaparral NGL Pipeline and a portion of our Mid-America Pipeline to move refined products from the Gulf Coast to West Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah.  Just outside of Mont Belvieu but still in Chambers County, we're going to build our 12th NGL fractionation train. We announced that we're going to build an ethane export terminal at a site to be determined on the Louisiana, Texas, Gulf Coast. We announced that we were going to double our ethylene export capacity. And then shortly after the analyst meeting, we issued a press release with Oxy stating that Oxy and Enterprise were going to team up to build a carbon capture sequestration header system between Beaumont and Houston. But get combined these projects we have announced, will still fall within the $1.5 billion to $2 billion annual CapEx.  Then I want to end the day with a few thoughts about the world's energy situation and how the U.S. is ideally positioned to step up with ample and reliable U.S. oil and gas. The U.S. has the capability to place Russia's exports of oil products and natural gas to our European allies, if we would unleash the God given shale resources that we're blessed with. After being dependent on the Middle East for nearly 50 years, the U.S. became energy secure and a net exporter of hydrocarbons over the last 10 years. While Europe moved the other way, depending on renewables and Russian natural gas. As Russia marched on Ukraine, their ideology came face to face with reality. Didn't have to be this way and it's not too late to correct it. If we would start being honest about the importance of fossil fuels, that importance being for decades to come. Unless we're ready to take a huge step back in human development, U.S. oil and gas production must continue to grow.  Regulatory uncertainty, politics and green hyperbole have led to a gap in funding worldwide and we're finding out the hard way that planning and producing these resources isn't on autopilot. It takes skilled people, new infrastructure, time and money. Look no further than the cancellation of Keystone, suspension of federal leases, the numerous canceled projects to get gas out of Appalachia and plight of The Mountain Valley Pipeline to see the constant roadblocks caused by the attitude in Washington and in the courts. The U.S. is going to reach its full potential and provide global leadership in the face Russia's tyranny. Our politicians, regulators and the courts must start being honest about the world's need for energy and step up and support the needed infrastructure, including pipelines, plants and LNG export facilities. Otherwise, we'll find ourselves increasingly beholden to bad despotic regimes for energy and for minerals and metals required to add green energy solutions. Randy?\nRandall Fowler : Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Starting with the income statement. Net income attributable to common unitholders for the first quarter of 2022 was $1.3 billion or $0.59 per unit compared to $1.3 billion or $0.61 per unit for the first quarter of last year. Net income was reduced by noncash asset impairment charges of $14 million or $0.01 per unit for the first quarter of this year. This compares to noncash asset impairment charges of $66 million or $0.03 per unit in the first quarter of 2021.  Jim discussed distributable cash flow and coverage. So moving on to adjusted cash flow from operations, which is our -- what we call adjusted cash flow from operations, which excludes working capital changes. It was $2 billion for the first quarter of 2022, and this compares to $1.9 billion for the first quarter of last year. We declared a distribution of $0.465 per common unit with respect to the first quarter 2022. This represents a 3.3% increase compared to the distribution declared for the first quarter of last year. This distribution will be paid May 12 to our common unitholders of record as of the close of the business April 29.  For the last 12 months, we returned $4 billion of cash distributions to limited partners and $200 million of buybacks. Our payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow, which again excludes the effect of working capital changes, and also if we exclude the $3.25 billion of the Navitas Midstream, was 80%. Total capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2022 were $3.6 billion, which included the acquisition Navitas Midstream, $275 million of organic growth capital projects and $75 million of sustaining capital expenditures. For 2022, we currently expect growth capital investments to be approximately $1.5 billion and sustaining capital expenditures to be approximately $350 million.  Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $29.8 billion at the end of the quarter. Assuming the final maturity of our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio is approximately 21 years. Our average cost of debt is 4.3%. And at March 31, approximately 95% of our debt was fixed rate. In February 2022, we repaid all of the maturing $1.4 billion of senior notes DD and CC using cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under our commercial paper facility. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $3.9 billion at March 31, including availability under our credit facilities and $231 million of unrestricted cash.  Since the close of the first quarter, we elected to terminate a $500 million delayed draw term loan, which had not been utilized. Reported adjusted EBITDA was $8.4 billion for the 12 months ended March 31, 2022. Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.4x after adjusting for -- after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid notes and also reduced by cash on hand.  And with that, Randy, I think we can open up for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay. Randy, thank you. Tanya, we're ready to take questions from our audience.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Colton Bean of Tudor, Pickering & Company.\nColton Bean: So just starting off on petchem, realizing jumping ahead a bit here to Q2, but it looks like some of the spreads have gapped higher over the last months, so specifically, butane to iso and then MTBE. Can you just remind us of your ability to capture those spreads in butane and octane businesses and whether any profit or any earnings uplift might be sustainable?\nChris D\u2019Anna: Colton, this is Chris D\u2019Anna. We're about 75% hedged. So we realize the benefit of what we're not hedged on. And that 75% is throughout the remainder of this year.\nColton Bean : Got it. And is that true of both the butane and the octane businesses?\nChris D\u2019Anna: That's just the octane business. And we still realize any benefits from uplift in the market as well.\nColton Bean : Okay. Great. And then just on the balance sheet, Randy, any updates to how you're thinking about the leverage profile? It seems like with the current earnings trajectory and commodity backdrop, you're likely to drop below the lower end of that target range at 3.25 debt-to-EBITDA.\nRandall Fowler : Yes. Well, Colton, again, we just finished with 3.4 for the quarter. Colton, we'll again stay in our range of 3.5x, plus or minus 0.25. And as we go through and see what kind of growth capital opportunities we have, what kind of acquisition opportunities that may be out there, we'll come in and adjust accordingly.\nColton Bean : Got it. So it sounds like CapEx would be still the primary directive in terms of staying within that range?\nRandall Fowler : Yes. I mean, Colton, we've come in and done buybacks for 4 years in a row. And the last 2 years, we've done about $200 million. I do expect for us to do buybacks later this year. We didn't do it in the first quarter because obviously, we had the $3.25 billion of Navitas. So we didn't do any buybacks in the first quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Reynolds of UBS.\nBrian Reynolds : First, I wanted to touch on the Permian near-term growth expectations versus the long-term tightening outlook. We saw Midland to ECHO crude volumes decline quarter-over-quarter. I'm just curious if you could just talk about how Permian Basin MVCs and competition for spot volumes are impacting EPD's crude volumes? And ultimately, when could we expect EPD's Permian crude equity volumes to inflect back towards the positive or back towards positive growth in line with basin expectations?\nBrent Secrest : This is Brent. I think on the volume, when you look at the structure in the market, there's some contracts, there's term contracts. But I think people are looking at the backwardation in the market and trying to figure out when those barrels come out on the other side. So we saw some contracted customers not shipped. And in terms of overall profitability, it doesn't really affect us with the nature of those contracts. The windows come back, I think you'll see when production growth and arb start opening back up, you'll see the volumes come back on our system. Yes. In terms of the profitability side, it's -- it doesn't really impact Enterprise. But in terms of volumes, how you look at it, when structure gets that backward, we did see some barrels come off our system.\nBrian Reynolds : Great. Makes sense. As one follow-up, maybe just to pivot to the 300,000 barrel per day expansion of Seaway that you talked about at the recent Analyst Day. The first question is, could you maybe just talk about the demand that you're seeing for this project given the demand markets in Houston and for export? And then secondly, do you see a scenario where just the increase in Canadian supply pushes back on Permian barrels flowing up into Cushing?\nJim Teague: For you, Tug.\nBrent Secrest : Tug, you want to take that?\nMichael Hanley : Yes. This is Tug. The first answer to your question is with respect to the expansion, that's going to flange up with Enbridge's decisions upstream of Cushing with regards to the Canadian growth that those guys are seeing. So they're poised to turn that online as soon as they see the need to do that. And then for the second question, I'll pass that one back to Brent.\nBrent Secrest : Yes. I think there's some sticky barrels that go from Permian up to Cushing just because of some of the refiners that want those barrels. My personal belief, and I've had this for quite some time as much capacity that we saw get pointed to the Gulf Coast. But ultimately, more of those barrels would fill the pipelines going toward the water. But we've seen some pretty good resilience even when we thought those barrels should have been pointed toward the water. There's a certain amount of demand up there in Cushing that will probably persist throughout this. And it's a different type of barrel than obviously what comes down from Canada that those refiners want up there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet : Just want to start off with the CO2 LOI as you guys press released recently. Mike, can I get a little bit more detail there as far as what kind of type of timeline would you expect, I guess, before a final investment decision, whether to move forward here? And just wanted to get a sense to the extent you're able to share how sizable could this project be. Hub could be a lot of stuff going on. And how much would be brownfield versus greenfield? Just any details there you're able to share would be very helpful.\nCarrie Weaver : Jeremy, it's Carrie Weaver. So on your first question on the details, we're looking at this as a complementary relationship with OLCV where we provide the transportation and they provide the sequestration. We've been talking to potential customers for several months now. And so these projects we see, they will take time to develop. But we've got a lot of great feedback from the customers. And believe as soon as they're ready to say go, we'll be able to move forward with the project. And the Gulf Coast is, I think, the most prime for a project like this with the emissions and the proximity of the emissions. And so we think there is a great opportunity in this area. And I think the second question as far as newbuild versus existing pipelines, if you take a look at our map, really any of the pipes we have could be put in -- most of the pipes we have we put in CO2 service whether that's in the gas phase or in the dense phase. And so it's just an evaluation of where we have those opportunities where we might have pipe capacity and then growing from there.\nJeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And then second question, just wanted to see with regards to Permian gas egress, you talked a bit about that at the Analyst Day. And obviously, there's -- seems there's clear need for that. I'm just wondering if there's any updated thoughts with the potential for Enterprise to expand existing assets like we've seen some other asset announcements recently or just any other thoughts on Enterprise's ability to partake in nat gas egress needs?\nCarrie Weaver : So we've -- we don't have any expansion capabilities on our existing 36-inch at 30-inch. But we're at looking opportunities to provide the basin with takeaway capacities. And then obviously, we've got some space open for ourselves, call it, middle of this year, end of the year that we talked about in Analyst Day.\nJim Teague : Jeremy, I think what she's saying is yes, we've got a project. But no, we're not going to tell you about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill of BOA.\nChase Mulvehill: I guess first question is just kind of around frac rates. I'm just kind of curious what you're seeing old frac rates today. Obviously, it seems like things are kind of tightening up there from a utilization standpoint. So I would kind of expect that frac rates maybe have moved off that $0.05 per gallon range. So just kind of any updates what you're seeing out there in the market on frac rates and maybe some utilization.\nBrent Secrest : I'd say -- this is Brent Secrest. On frac fees, we are seeing fees trend up, and I'd say that's pretty much a general comment for a lot of midstream services. In terms of volume, volumes were a little bit down in the first quarter. A lot of that had to do with freeze-offs and turnarounds that we had scheduled that we moved up because of freeze-offs. But if you look at the projections of the Y-grade receipts we have coming in, it's going up pretty much month-over-month.\nChase Mulvehill : Okay. Sorry. And then pivoting over to ethane exports. I think in the press release, I think I read that the average ethane export fees increased in 4Q -- or sorry, in 1Q. I guess kind of curious what's driving that. I don't know if you -- I don't think you have commodity price exposure there, but maybe I'm wrong. So I don't know kind of -- is that new contracts? Or is it commodity price exposure that's driving those export fees up?\nJustin Kleiderer : Chase, it's Justin Kleiderer. I'd say, in general, we've probably seen a trend in what spot volumes are available and the fees associated to those go higher than what we've seen over the last, call it, 12 to 18 months. But for the most part, the ethane export story is really a volume story.\nChase Mulvehill : Okay. Remind me again, how much -- what's your contracted versus spot on ethane export?\nJustin Kleiderer : We call our kind of day-to-day capacity a shade over 200,000 barrels a day. So call it, we've got 20 to 25 a day as we sit here.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Theresa Chen of Barclays.\nTheresa Chen : Tug, I wanted to ask first about your Texas Western product system. You've been helpful in providing some color at Analyst Day about the capacity of origination, i.e., how many barrels per day you ship out -- ship up from the Houston area. But can we get a sense of the delivery capacity by market between the endpoints in the Permian, Albuquerque, New Mexico and Grand Junction? And where do you see the incremental demand coming from?\nMichael Hanley : Sure. So I'll just take it by segment. Chaparral do up to full capacity of around 90,000 barrels a day. And then if you were to look at the Rockies segment, its full capacity could be up to 75,000 barrels a day. If you go to Albuquerque, as you drop barrels off there, the capacity will go down as you go further north towards Grand Junction. So the difference between those 2 numbers is what you'd be able to drop off in the Permian. And then sorry, what was the second question you had?\nTheresa Chen : Just where do you see the most demand coming from of those 3 markets?\nMichael Hanley : Yes. I think if you look at those markets and the fact that they need competition, I would say that Grand Junction, which is presently capped to local supply and rail, that will be a big step up in demand. However, it's not -- the market size is not as big as Albuquerque, for example. So it's going to be a combination of those and the Rockies in addition to supplying the Permian producers in the Delaware distillate as well on our gel terminal.\nTheresa Chen : And I also wanted to ask about the downstream implications from the ethane perspective, kind of going back to the question. But seeing the supply chain logistical issues on the polymer side and the economic run cuts we're seeing at some of your customers, I was just curious how do you see this play out? And maybe Chris can help shed some light on the next steps from here.\nMichael Hanley : Yes. I'd say, from the ethane balancing point, we're starting to see a slight build of ethane in our storage system. So as you see depressed natural gas prices in the Permian Basin, you see more ethane get recovered out of that area. And you look at the NGL volumes that you've seen step up on our system, ultimately, I think there's going to be some gives and takes on the petchem side until these things get worked out and for it to work on a more fluid basis. I just think you're going to see starts and stops throughout the process.\nJim Teague : This is Jim. I think you're definitely seeing the supply chain somewhat concentrated. You're right, we're realizing some economic run cuts in ethylene plants as they're stacking up polyethylene. But that ultimately gets resolved. And this is still the most price-advantaged market in the world.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury of Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury : How will Enterprise be affected if the Permian does out of gas takeaway in the next year across your different segments? And would you expect the net result on EBITDA to be positive or negative if that happens?\nJim Teague : Jean Ann, Brent has been stressing out over what question you would ask. So we're going to let him answer.\nBrent Secrest: I mean I think the benefits, Jean Ann, I'm not going to sit here and quantify how this all plays out. But obviously, with the exposure we have on natural gas and that capacity at 300 a day, obviously, we're beneficiaries of it. If you go downstream to what I just talked about on the NGL pipelines, the amount of ethane that's going to be forced in the recovery, I think it's incredibly beneficial for our franchise on the pipeline segment coming out of there. If you go downstream from there and you look at fractionation, you look at the ethane dock, you look at our storage complex, I think there's a lot of ways for us to benefit as Enterprise. No different to the last question, it's not going to all work. We talked about that there's going to be opportunities. And there's going to be dislocations. And it's not going to go step by step. But ultimately, when stuff like that happens, and I've been around this company for a while, there's a lot of ways for Enterprise to benefit.\nJean Ann Salisbury : All right. And you feel good that it will probably at least offset losses and growth from NGL production there if that gets flared or shut in?\nBrent Secrest : Yes, and we'll see how it all plays out. I mean we're seeing opportunities on our processing side to accommodate other computing processing companies to handle those volumes. So I just think when you look at our footprint, Jean Ann, if something like that happens and it gets delayed, I just think there's a lot of opportunities for us.\nJim Teague : And you still had tender announced that they were going to expand the 2 gas pipelines by what, $400 million, $500 million a day each by the fourth quarter of next year. So I mean, yes, you're going to have some issues in the short term, but those things always get fixed.\nJean Ann Salisbury : Yes. And then as a follow-up, I think you had been expecting some material roll-offs in the Eagle Ford and South Texas this year. Is that looking a lot better now that Eagle Ford gas is already rebounding?\nAnthony Chovanec: We've been expecting what? This is Tony. Say that again, Jean Ann.\nJean Ann Salisbury : I think that you'd kind of guided to expecting some roll-offs on rate in your South Texas and Eagle Ford system this year and next. But now it feels like we're kind of headed back to previous highs in the Eagle Ford. So I wanted to see if I should sort of take that out of my model.\nAnthony Chovanec: Jean Ann, I mean, there's a big contract roll off on EFS that rolls off at the end of the second quarter. Those volumes are contracted. The volumes still contracted. It's long-term dedications to us. It's just at a different fee. I do say on the dry gas side and on the processing side, we're seeing some benefits throughout the entire Eagle Ford system. But from a total dollars perspective, you're going to see some impact for what rolls off on EFS.\nJim Teague : Up on your plants in Eagle Ford, Natalie?\nNatalie Gayden: We're full, and we're actually restarting a plant that we decided now to spend capital on a couple of years ago. And then we don't talk about it a lot but we're processing over 400 million a day of lean gas today in the Eagle Ford. Customers are asking for treating capacity every day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse.\nSpiro Dounis : I just had a follow-up to Colton's earlier question actually. Just thinking about sustainability of results overall rather than just petchem. About the rest of the year, you've obviously got some tailwinds here with Navitas ramping up some growth projects. You just mentioned a bit of a headwind there with some contracts rolling off. But I think about how you're tracking ready only 1 quarter in, you're sort of hitting that $9 billion run rate already that you guys had mentioned during the Analyst Day. So just curious, as you think about the rest of the year, what are you looking at in terms of puts and takes that maybe get you there?\nJim Teague : Yes, we can do the math, Spiro. That was the answer.\nBrent Secrest : I mean this is Brent. I think when you look at what we have going forward, I feel like we're in a pretty good spot. I mean things change. But when you look at where the pace and the trajectory of where this thing is going and the opportunities that we see before us, you can look at some contract roll-off, but it's not significant. I feel like what we're offering as a company, and you heard Tony talk about it during Analyst Day with the volumes that we see coming on, as things get more and more constrained, what we have to offer just goes up in value. So I know we don't give guidance. But in terms of the cadence, I feel pretty good about where we're at.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Blum of Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum : Just really one kind of high-level question for me. And Jim, you referenced the 7 new projects you announced at the Investor Day. I think your forecast is pretty bullish for volumes underpinning a lot of those projects. So my question really is, how do you reconcile that with U.S. public E&P stands to remain capital disciplined in the face of high commodity prices?\nJim Teague : Natalie, are we seeing our throughput go up?\nNatalie Gayden: Yes. The Delaware throughput has gone up. And we've been disciplined with the growth or with the builds of new plants. However, the private operators are drilling. And then we've got forecast from other operators that show we've got to have plant capacity. So that's what we're seeing. Delaware is full every day.\nJim Teague : Zach, do you see in yours go up?\nZach Strait: On the frac side -- this is Zach. On the frac side, we continue to see volume growth. And even the publics that are saying they're not growing or out trying to contract, whether it be spot volumes or shorter-term volumes, so I hear what they're saying, but what we are seeing, it contradicts it a little bit.\nJim Teague: Yes. Michael, I'd also add that probably 70% -- between 75% and 80% of the rig count in the United States is Permian, Haynesville and Eagle Ford.\nAnthony Chovanec : Yes. And then this is Tony, so I'll add one other thing. If you look at the weekly numbers by the EIA, they're showing somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels a day of increase since the 1st of the year. So these numbers are -- they are slowly inching up. If you look at the amount of rigs that very qualified operators have and still getting increased efficiencies out of them, they don't necessarily have to spend a tremendous amount of more money or put more tremendous amount of rigs out in the field to grow their production some. So we had said 1.5 million barrels between '22 and '23 not knowing exactly how it's going to fall. It looks like it's going to fall. Volumes won't start increasing until, call it, the third or probably even fourth quarter of '22 to where people really start looking. But we're absolutely seeing it everywhere in our system.\nMichael Hanley : Yes. This is Tug. I'll just add, similar to the Zach's note, Natalie spoke to the equity production that she sees in the Enterprise has, but third-party volumes are continuing to increase as well. Using [Chinook] as an example, we had a record quarter, transporting just under 500,000 barrels a day, so going up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley : I had 2 follow-up questions. First on the Texas Western products expansion. Just curious, since the Analyst Day, if you're seeing with conversations with customers any demand for long-term contracts there? Or if you think it will operate more on a spot basis? And then second question, just following up on, I guess, the petchem segment and the strength you saw in Q1. Just any more color you're seeing in the market in petchem? And how repeatable you think $400 million type margin quarters are in that segment this year?\nJim Teague : It's going to be career limiting for Chris D'Anna if we don't see it. Do you have anything, Chris?\nChris D\u2019Anna: Yes. I guess second question first. I mean if you look at where spreads have gone, you see the normal has gradually widened throughout the first quarter. So looking for the rest of the year, it's pretty strong. Meanwhile, on the propylene side, spreads from the start of, call it, last year have marginally compressed. And I think I talked about last year how we expect to continue to see wider spreads as long as the supply chain issues persist. So I don't know if that helps. But...\nMichael Hanley : All right. Back to -- this is Tug going back to your first question. I'll just say this. I think it's an understatement as far as how much interest we've received as we started talking to our customers on TW products. The interest has been significant. I will say that the rack market in nature is somewhat of a short-term market. Typically, those contracts are between 1 and 2 years. And quite frankly, I think there are certain things that we'd like to keep short in term in nature due to the spread and market opportunities in those markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides : I know you've had Navitas only for a number of weeks now. But just curious -- and this may be a little bit of a follow-on from an earlier question, how different is the common carry kind of for end of '22 and through 2023 production growth you\u2019re hearing from your Delaware producer customers versus your Midland ones?\nNatalie Gayden: When you say common carry, what are you referring to?\nMichael Lapides : Meaning, when you're talking to your producers and they're talking about how much they want to grow, can you just talk about how different what you're hearing from producer customers are in the Delaware versus the Midland?\nNatalie Gayden: Well, put this way, Delaware has more majors. We're exposed of majors in the Delaware versus Midland. Midland, more private. I would say most have said flat to grow. But then when we get production forecast, they look a little bit different. And then in Midland, we have a lot of want for unloads from other processors. There's quite a few people still flaring in Midland, but not too much different other than a typical private public type of story.\nMichael Lapides : Got it. And then turning to the ethane export facility. You talked about at the Analyst Day and it's a couple of years out from trying to think about COD. But just curious how capital-intensive of a project? And what are some of the milestones we should be monitoring kind of as analysts or investors, just to kind of track where you all are in terms of signing up contracts if you're going to try and fully contracted and just kind of take it from something that's on the drawing board to something that's in operation?\nJim Teague : We have a contract for that expansion. So we have a pretty good size banker just to pick up.\nNatalie Gayden: Yes. I think as we talked about in the Analyst Day, I think the key path right now is just site location. And I think once we determine that, then it's about pulling trigger. I mean we're committed to build it. And [EOS] has backed it. And as soon as fine-tune our location, then we're going to be going on.\nBrent Secrest : And we have numerous conversations going on with others.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cusimano of Pickering Energy.\nMichael Cusimano : I have a few follow-on questions. First, relating to your commentary on Jean Ann's question, can you quantify how much ethane you're seeing or rejected in your primary systems today you can get an idea as to what that upside looks like in a Waha blowout?\nJim Teague: In Permian?\nBrent Secrest : Total across all Permian Basin, it's probably around 250, even some of it's hard to be recovered and some of it's non-integrated type plants. 200 to 250, Tony?\nAnthony Chovanec : I agree with that, yes.\nMichael Cusimano : Okay. And that's as of today that's trajecting?\nAnthony Chovanec : Well, it's -- over the last few weeks, it comes and goes because midstream operators, like ourselves, step in when we can. So...\nMichael Cusimano : Okay. That's helpful. And then to follow on from an export question earlier, can you talk through the dynamics you're seeing across the docks on rates and demand? You pointed to lower fees at EHT on the NGL side, but higher on crude and then the commentary around Morgan\u2019s Point. Just curious from a high level how maybe any flows might be shifting on system as well as, yes, commentary around rates would be helpful.\nBrent Secrest: Yes. I mean I think every commodity has its dynamics. But at the end of the day, similar to our commentary from Analyst Day, I mean, they're all going to have their day where supply starts to exceed that, which the industry can export. And so in general, we think the trend is up and to the right in terms of export fees.\nJim Teague: And when you look at a U.S. barrel compared to everything else, there is no comparison. And we don't think there's going to be because we remain constructive on crude prices.\nOperator: I am not showing any further questions at this time. The replay for this call is available until May 9 at 11:59 p.m. by dialing (855) 859-2056 or (404) 537-3406. The conference ID is 9788240. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Randy Burkhalter for closing remarks.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Tanya. That's all. That concludes our remarks today. So we'd like to thank all of our participants for joining us, and have a good day. Goodbye. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Randall Fowler",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Starting with the income statement. Net income attributable to common unitholders for the first quarter of 2022 was $1.3 billion or $0.59 per unit compared to $1.3 billion or $0.61 per unit for the first quarter of last year. Net income was reduced by noncash asset impairment charges of $14 million or $0.01 per unit for the first quarter of this year. This compares to noncash asset impairment charges of $66 million or $0.03 per unit in the first quarter of 2021.  Jim discussed distributable cash flow and coverage. So moving on to adjusted cash flow from operations, which is our -- what we call adjusted cash flow from operations, which excludes working capital changes. It was $2 billion for the first quarter of 2022, and this compares to $1.9 billion for the first quarter of last year. We declared a distribution of $0.465 per common unit with respect to the first quarter 2022. This represents a 3.3% increase compared to the distribution declared for the first quarter of last year. This distribution will be paid May 12 to our common unitholders of record as of the close of the business April 29.  For the last 12 months, we returned $4 billion of cash distributions to limited partners and $200 million of buybacks. Our payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow, which again excludes the effect of working capital changes, and also if we exclude the $3.25 billion of the Navitas Midstream, was 80%. Total capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2022 were $3.6 billion, which included the acquisition Navitas Midstream, $275 million of organic growth capital projects and $75 million of sustaining capital expenditures. For 2022, we currently expect growth capital investments to be approximately $1.5 billion and sustaining capital expenditures to be approximately $350 million.  Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $29.8 billion at the end of the quarter. Assuming the final maturity of our hybrids, the average life of our debt portfolio is approximately 21 years. Our average cost of debt is 4.3%. And at March 31, approximately 95% of our debt was fixed rate. In February 2022, we repaid all of the maturing $1.4 billion of senior notes DD and CC using cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes under our commercial paper facility. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $3.9 billion at March 31, including availability under our credit facilities and $231 million of unrestricted cash.  Since the close of the first quarter, we elected to terminate a $500 million delayed draw term loan, which had not been utilized. Reported adjusted EBITDA was $8.4 billion for the 12 months ended March 31, 2022. Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.4x after adjusting for -- after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid notes and also reduced by cash on hand.  And with that, Randy, I think we can open up for questions. Yes. Well, Colton, again, we just finished with 3.4 for the quarter. Colton, we'll again stay in our range of 3.5x, plus or minus 0.25. And as we go through and see what kind of growth capital opportunities we have, what kind of acquisition opportunities that may be out there, we'll come in and adjust accordingly. Yes. I mean, Colton, we've come in and done buybacks for 4 years in a row. And the last 2 years, we've done about $200 million. I do expect for us to do buybacks later this year. We didn't do it in the first quarter because obviously, we had the $3.25 billion of Navitas. So we didn't do any buybacks in the first quarter."

            "content": "Yes. This is Tug. The first answer to your question is with respect to the expansion, that's going to flange up with Enbridge's decisions upstream of Cushing with regards to the Canadian growth that those guys are seeing. So they're poised to turn that online as soon as they see the need to do that. And then for the second question, I'll pass that one back to Brent. Sure. So I'll just take it by segment. Chaparral do up to full capacity of around 90,000 barrels a day. And then if you were to look at the Rockies segment, its full capacity could be up to 75,000 barrels a day. If you go to Albuquerque, as you drop barrels off there, the capacity will go down as you go further north towards Grand Junction. So the difference between those 2 numbers is what you'd be able to drop off in the Permian. And then sorry, what was the second question you had? Yes. I think if you look at those markets and the fact that they need competition, I would say that Grand Junction, which is presently capped to local supply and rail, that will be a big step up in demand. However, it's not -- the market size is not as big as Albuquerque, for example. So it's going to be a combination of those and the Rockies in addition to supplying the Permian producers in the Delaware distillate as well on our gel terminal. Yes. I'd say, from the ethane balancing point, we're starting to see a slight build of ethane in our storage system. So as you see depressed natural gas prices in the Permian Basin, you see more ethane get recovered out of that area. And you look at the NGL volumes that you've seen step up on our system, ultimately, I think there's going to be some gives and takes on the petchem side until these things get worked out and for it to work on a more fluid basis. I just think you're going to see starts and stops throughout the process. Yes. This is Tug. I'll just add, similar to the Zach's note, Natalie spoke to the equity production that she sees in the Enterprise has, but third-party volumes are continuing to increase as well. Using [Chinook] as an example, we had a record quarter, transporting just under 500,000 barrels a day, so going up. All right. Back to -- this is Tug going back to your first question. I'll just say this. I think it's an understatement as far as how much interest we've received as we started talking to our customers on TW products. The interest has been significant. I will say that the rack market in nature is somewhat of a short-term market. Typically, those contracts are between 1 and 2 years. And quite frankly, I think there are certain things that we'd like to keep short in term in nature due to the spread and market opportunities in those markets."

That's just the octane business. And we still realize any benefits from uplift in the market as well. Yes. I guess second question first. I mean if you look at where spreads have gone, you see the normal has gradually widened throughout the first quarter. So looking for the rest of the year, it's pretty strong. Meanwhile, on the propylene side, spreads from the start of, call it, last year have marginally compressed. And I think I talked about last year how we expect to continue to see wider spreads as long as the supply chain issues persist. So I don't know if that helps. But..."

I'd say, in general, we've probably seen a trend in what spot volumes are available and the fees associated to those go higher than what we've seen over the last, call it, 12 to 18 months. But for the most part, the ethane export story is really a volume story. We call our kind of day-to-day capacity a shade over 200,000 barrels a day. So call it, we've got 20 to 25 a day as we sit here."

So on your first question on the details, we're looking at this as a complementary relationship with OLCV where we provide the transportation and they provide the sequestration. We've been talking to potential customers for several months now. And so these projects we see, they will take time to develop. But we've got a lot of great feedback from the customers. And believe as soon as they're ready to say go, we'll be able to move forward with the project. And the Gulf Coast is, I think, the most prime for a project like this with the emissions and the proximity of the emissions. And so we think there is a great opportunity in this area. And I think the second question as far as newbuild versus existing pipelines, if you take a look at our map, really any of the pipes we have could be put in -- most of the pipes we have we put in CO2 service whether that's in the gas phase or in the dense phase. And so it's just an evaluation of where we have those opportunities where we might have pipe capacity and then growing from there. So we've -- we don't have any expansion capabilities on our existing 36-inch at 30-inch. But we're at looking opportunities to provide the basin with takeaway capacities. And then obviously, we've got some space open for ourselves, call it, middle of this year, end of the year that we talked about in Analyst Day."

            "content": "Thank you, Randy. I've got two numbers to start off with: $2.3 billion in EBITDA, 1.8 times distribution coverage, I think that says it all. Looking back, it seems like the first quarter of each of the last three years has been a quarter of events. First quarter 2020 COVID-19 shut everything down and we had too much of everything everywhere and our people did pretty good. Last year in the first quarter of 2021, Winter Storm Uri wreaked havoc on the entire State of Texas, shutting in production like we've never seen, our folks did pretty good. And then in late February of this year, the world rather suddenly found itself dealing with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and dealing with having to supplement Russian energy to our allies in Europe, along with coming to grips with the growing importance of energy security. In all three scenarios, pandemic, massive weather events and a sudden global energy shortage, our people delivered. If for some reason you missed our analyst meeting, we announced seven new projects. And going into that analyst meeting, notwithstanding the invasion of Ukraine, we were bullish from both a supply and demand perspective for U.S. oil natural gas and NGOs, and we're planning for growth. During our meeting, we announced seven growth projects related to both supply and demand. We're going to build our sixth processing plant in the Midland Basin. That's the assets we bought from Navitas. In the Delaware, we're going to build our second plant at Mentone. In Louisiana, we're expanding our Acadian Haynesville natural gas pipeline by 400 million cubic foot a day. In Texas, we're reversing our Chaparral NGL Pipeline and a portion of our Mid-America Pipeline to move refined products from the Gulf Coast to West Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah.  Just outside of Mont Belvieu but still in Chambers County, we're going to build our 12th NGL fractionation train. We announced that we're going to build an ethane export terminal at a site to be determined on the Louisiana, Texas, Gulf Coast. We announced that we were going to double our ethylene export capacity. And then shortly after the analyst meeting, we issued a press release with Oxy stating that Oxy and Enterprise were going to team up to build a carbon capture sequestration header system between Beaumont and Houston. But get combined these projects we have announced, will still fall within the $1.5 billion to $2 billion annual CapEx.  Then I want to end the day with a few thoughts about the world's energy situation and how the U.S. is ideally positioned to step up with ample and reliable U.S. oil and gas. The U.S. has the capability to place Russia's exports of oil products and natural gas to our European allies, if we would unleash the God given shale resources that we're blessed with. After being dependent on the Middle East for nearly 50 years, the U.S. became energy secure and a net exporter of hydrocarbons over the last 10 years. While Europe moved the other way, depending on renewables and Russian natural gas. As Russia marched on Ukraine, their ideology came face to face with reality. Didn't have to be this way and it's not too late to correct it. If we would start being honest about the importance of fossil fuels, that importance being for decades to come. Unless we're ready to take a huge step back in human development, U.S. oil and gas production must continue to grow.  Regulatory uncertainty, politics and green hyperbole have led to a gap in funding worldwide and we're finding out the hard way that planning and producing these resources isn't on autopilot. It takes skilled people, new infrastructure, time and money. Look no further than the cancellation of Keystone, suspension of federal leases, the numerous canceled projects to get gas out of Appalachia and plight of The Mountain Valley Pipeline to see the constant roadblocks caused by the attitude in Washington and in the courts. The U.S. is going to reach its full potential and provide global leadership in the face Russia's tyranny. Our politicians, regulators and the courts must start being honest about the world's need for energy and step up and support the needed infrastructure, including pipelines, plants and LNG export facilities. Otherwise, we'll find ourselves increasingly beholden to bad despotic regimes for energy and for minerals and metals required to add green energy solutions. Randy? For you, Tug. Jeremy, I think what she's saying is yes, we've got a project. But no, we're not going to tell you about it. This is Jim. I think you're definitely seeing the supply chain somewhat concentrated. You're right, we're realizing some economic run cuts in ethylene plants as they're stacking up polyethylene. But that ultimately gets resolved. And this is still the most price-advantaged market in the world. Jean Ann, Brent has been stressing out over what question you would ask. So we're going to let him answer. And you still had tender announced that they were going to expand the 2 gas pipelines by what, $400 million, $500 million a day each by the fourth quarter of next year. So I mean, yes, you're going to have some issues in the short term, but those things always get fixed. Up on your plants in Eagle Ford, Natalie? Yes, we can do the math, Spiro. That was the answer. Natalie, are we seeing our throughput go up? Zach, do you see in yours go up? Yes. Michael, I'd also add that probably 70% -- between 75% and 80% of the rig count in the United States is Permian, Haynesville and Eagle Ford. It's going to be career limiting for Chris D'Anna if we don't see it. Do you have anything, Chris? We have a contract for that expansion. So we have a pretty good size banker just to pick up. In Permian? And when you look at a U.S. barrel compared to everything else, there is no comparison. And we don't think there's going to be because we remain constructive on crude prices."

And then we don't talk about it a lot but we're processing over 400 million a day of lean gas today in the Eagle Ford. Customers are asking for treating capacity every day. Yes. The Delaware throughput has gone up. And we've been disciplined with the growth or with the builds of new plants. However, the private operators are drilling. And then we've got forecast from other operators that show we've got to have plant capacity. So that's what we're seeing. Delaware is full every day. When you say common carry, what are you referring to? Well, put this way, Delaware has more majors. We're exposed of majors in the Delaware versus Midland. Midland, more private. I would say most have said flat to grow. But then when we get production forecast, they look a little bit different. And then in Midland, we have a lot of want for unloads from other processors. There's quite a few people still flaring in Midland, but not too much different other than a typical private public type of story. Yes. I think as we talked about in the Analyst Day, I think the key path right now is just site location. And I think once we determine that, then it's about pulling trigger. I mean we're committed to build it. And [EOS] has backed it. And as soon as fine-tune our location, then we're going to be going on."

            "content": "This is Brent. I think on the volume, when you look at the structure in the market, there's some contracts, there's term contracts. But I think people are looking at the backwardation in the market and trying to figure out when those barrels come out on the other side. So we saw some contracted customers not shipped. And in terms of overall profitability, it doesn't really affect us with the nature of those contracts. The windows come back, I think you'll see when production growth and arb start opening back up, you'll see the volumes come back on our system. Yes. In terms of the profitability side, it's -- it doesn't really impact Enterprise. But in terms of volumes, how you look at it, when structure gets that backward, we did see some barrels come off our system. Tug, you want to take that? Yes. I think there's some sticky barrels that go from Permian up to Cushing just because of some of the refiners that want those barrels. My personal belief, and I've had this for quite some time as much capacity that we saw get pointed to the Gulf Coast. But ultimately, more of those barrels would fill the pipelines going toward the water. But we've seen some pretty good resilience even when we thought those barrels should have been pointed toward the water. There's a certain amount of demand up there in Cushing that will probably persist throughout this. And it's a different type of barrel than obviously what comes down from Canada that those refiners want up there. I'd say -- this is Brent Secrest. On frac fees, we are seeing fees trend up, and I'd say that's pretty much a general comment for a lot of midstream services. In terms of volume, volumes were a little bit down in the first quarter. A lot of that had to do with freeze-offs and turnarounds that we had scheduled that we moved up because of freeze-offs. But if you look at the projections of the Y-grade receipts we have coming in, it's going up pretty much month-over-month. I mean I think the benefits, Jean Ann, I'm not going to sit here and quantify how this all plays out. But obviously, with the exposure we have on natural gas and that capacity at 300 a day, obviously, we're beneficiaries of it. If you go downstream to what I just talked about on the NGL pipelines, the amount of ethane that's going to be forced in the recovery, I think it's incredibly beneficial for our franchise on the pipeline segment coming out of there. If you go downstream from there and you look at fractionation, you look at the ethane dock, you look at our storage complex, I think there's a lot of ways for us to benefit as Enterprise. No different to the last question, it's not going to all work. We talked about that there's going to be opportunities. And there's going to be dislocations. And it's not going to go step by step. But ultimately, when stuff like that happens, and I've been around this company for a while, there's a lot of ways for Enterprise to benefit. Yes, and we'll see how it all plays out. I mean we're seeing opportunities on our processing side to accommodate other computing processing companies to handle those volumes. So I just think when you look at our footprint, Jean Ann, if something like that happens and it gets delayed, I just think there's a lot of opportunities for us. I mean this is Brent. I think when you look at what we have going forward, I feel like we're in a pretty good spot. I mean things change. But when you look at where the pace and the trajectory of where this thing is going and the opportunities that we see before us, you can look at some contract roll-off, but it's not significant. I feel like what we're offering as a company, and you heard Tony talk about it during Analyst Day with the volumes that we see coming on, as things get more and more constrained, what we have to offer just goes up in value. So I know we don't give guidance. But in terms of the cadence, I feel pretty good about where we're at. And we have numerous conversations going on with others. Total across all Permian Basin, it's probably around 250, even some of it's hard to be recovered and some of it's non-integrated type plants. 200 to 250, Tony? Yes. I mean I think every commodity has its dynamics. But at the end of the day, similar to our commentary from Analyst Day, I mean, they're all going to have their day where supply starts to exceed that, which the industry can export. And so in general, we think the trend is up and to the right in terms of export fees."

Those volumes are contracted. The volumes still contracted. It's long-term dedications to us. It's just at a different fee. I do say on the dry gas side and on the processing side, we're seeing some benefits throughout the entire Eagle Ford system. But from a total dollars perspective, you're going to see some impact for what rolls off on EFS. Yes. And then this is Tony, so I'll add one other thing. If you look at the weekly numbers by the EIA, they're showing somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels a day of increase since the 1st of the year. So these numbers are -- they are slowly inching up. If you look at the amount of rigs that very qualified operators have and still getting increased efficiencies out of them, they don't necessarily have to spend a tremendous amount of more money or put more tremendous amount of rigs out in the field to grow their production some. So we had said 1.5 million barrels between '22 and '23 not knowing exactly how it's going to fall. It looks like it's going to fall. Volumes won't start increasing until, call it, the third or probably even fourth quarter of '22 to where people really start looking. But we're absolutely seeing it everywhere in our system. I agree with that, yes. Well, it's -- over the last few weeks, it comes and goes because midstream operators, like ourselves, step in when we can. So..."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Randy Burkhalter, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Josh. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2023 earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise\u2019s general partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise\u2019s management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. And with that, I will turn it over to you Jim.\nJim Teague: Thank you, Randy. We generated $7.6 billion of distributable cash flow in 2023, providing 1.7 times coverage, and we retained $3.2 billion. We set nine financial records and 13 operating records in 2013. Our 2023 operating results included records in NGL pipeline transportation, ethane exports, total NGL marine terminal volumes, NGL fractionation volumes, fee based natural gas processing volumes and crude pipeline and natural gas transportation volumes barrels of oil equivalent per day enterprise transported a record 12.2 million barrels a day in 2023, compared to 11.2 million barrels a day in 2022. During the fourth quarter, we transported 12.7 million barrels a day, compared to 11.5 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2022. We exported a record 2.3 million barrels a day of liquid hydrocarbons. That includes everything from crude oil to LPGs to ethane, refined products and basic petrochemicals, ethane and propylene. When you look at our exports, it's clear that enterprise is not a one trick pony. It's quite remarkable that volumes across all our pipes and facilities increased sequentially each quarter in 2023, supported by the strong supply and demand fundamentals for hydrocarbons from the Permian and other basins we serve integrated with the midstream services we have, including exports that we just discussed. Relative to commodity markets, 2023 was a relatively weak year, especially for natural gas and natural gas liquids. Nonetheless, Enterprise proved once again that we don't need really high prices to make substantial returns. The financial records and 13 operating records summarized were achieved in a commodity price environment where natural gas prices were down almost 60% from 2022, crude was down nearly 20%, propane was down 36%, ethane was down almost 50%, and the NGL processing basket was down 35%. Relative to the several 2023 records at our marine terminals, we have long said that hydrocarbons would price to export proven once again in 2023. In growth capital during 2023, we completed construction of $3.5 billion of projects. Significant assets put into service include two new natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin and our 12th NGO fractionator in Chambers County. All of these assets were essentially full after operations began. While production of our PDH 2 facility was completed in the third quarter of 2023, we spent much of the remainder of the year addressing startup issues. As a result, this plant did not meet our expectations and earnings in 2023. We believe most of these issues have been resolved and we anticipate much higher utilization rates this year. We began 2024 with 6.8 billion of major organic projects under construction, with three projects representing approximately $1.1 billion in capital investment expected to be completed this year. Major 2024 projects include our Texas Western Products pipeline system and two additional processing plants in the Permian. We have considerable amount of growth capital underway. All of these projects provide strategic growth to our system and can add considerable disability to new sources of cash flow. I wanted to take a minute to talk about project 9.3. We started this project in 2022 as an incentive for all employees to find innovative ways to improve the bottom line. This was especially important as we in the industry were re-engaged  This was especially important as we in the industry were reengaging after COVID and faced the challenges of a slower global economy in 2023. We achieved the goals we set for ourselves both in 2022 and 2023. We are very proud of our employees for that accomplishment. That said, we will not have a Project 9 type program for 2024. You've always heard me say, if you want to know where we're going, look at what we're doing. The Permian Basin has been the cornerstone for much of our growth capital. As we look at 2024 and beyond, we see supply and demand opportunities as the Permian continues to grow and the world continues to have an ever-increasing appetite for U.S. hydrocarbons. We noted in the press release that these may be the most geopolitically challenging times since World War II, but it's abundantly clear that all of this chaos is leading itself to a growing appetite for the most stable hydrocarbon supplies in the world, the USA, in spite of government and regulatory challenges. Without a doubt, relative to energy, our nation's biggest geopolitical challenges continue to be self-inflicted. Enterprise has one of the world's leading natural gas liquids franchise, and we have the liquids hydrocarbon storage and export franchise. On top of all of that, we have a dedicated employee base that creates value, regardless of the environment. 2023 marked our 25th anniversary as a public company. It's been a great quarter century. It has been for the U.S. energy industry. It included the downfall of the energy merchants, the great financial crisis, the innovation of the E&P and oil field service industries to unlock the potential of the Shell plays, which is still continuing. It included the near-debt and remarkable renaissance of the U.S. petrochemical industry, from having the highest cost feedstock pre-Shell to now the lowest cost. It included two OPEC price wars, a once-in-a-century pandemic, and the re-emergence of geopolitical upheaval. During this time, we stuck to our objectives of investing capital at reasonable returns, providing reliable value-added services to customers, consistently returning capital to our partners, and increasing the value of the partnership for the long-term. During this time, the enterprise value of the partnership has grown from $1.2 billion to almost $90 billion. The value of our partnership units has increased almost 400%. We increased our distribution 25 consecutive years at an approximately 7% compound annual growth rate. We've returned $52 billion of capital to investors through distributions and buybacks. We have high-quality employees, and we thank our employees, we thank our customers, our service providers, our banks, and our investors for their contributions to this success. We're looking forward to the exciting opportunities and challenges for the next 25 years as the world's population, quality of life, and demand for energy reaches new heights. Put frankly, based on what I see in the future for energy, I'd give anything if I could turn the clock back and be 50 years old. With that, I'll turn it over to Randy.\nRandy Fowler: All right. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Starting off with the income statement, the net income attributable to common unit holders for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.6 billion or $0.72 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.4 billion or $0.65 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted cash flow from operations, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital, was $2.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. We declared a distribution of $0.515 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2023, which is a 5.1% increase over the distribution declared for the fourth quarter of 2022. The distribution will be paid February 14th to common unit holders of record as of the close of business on January 31st. In the fourth quarter, the partnership purchased 3.7 million common units off the open market for $96 million. Total purchases for 2023 were $187 million or 7.2 million common units, bringing total purchases under our buyback program to over $900 million. I mentioned it on the last call, looking at our five largest midstream peers by market cap. Since 2019, Enterprise is the only midstream energy company to reduce absolute outstanding units outstanding without significant asset sales. In addition to buybacks, our distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 6.6 million common units on the open market for $172 million during 2023. For 2023, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.3 billion in distributions to limited partners. These distributions combined with the buybacks for the year, resulting in our having a payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations of 56% and a payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow of 94%. Total capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1 billion, which included $823 million for growth capital projects, $65 million for the acquisition of a small natural gas storage facility that we have historically leased, and $129 million of sustaining capital expenditures. Capital investments for the year of 2023 were $3.3 billion, which includes $2.75 billion of organic growth capital projects, $100 million in asset acquisitions, and $413 million of sustaining capital expenditures. During the third quarter call, we estimated $3 billion of organic growth capital expenditures in 2023 and a range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion in 2024. Due to the timing of expenditures, we had approximately $250 million of CapEx shift from 2023 into 2024. Therefore, we now expect our 2024 growth capital expenditures to total $3.25 billion to $3.75 billion. We expect 2024 sustaining CapEx will be approximately $550 million, which includes dollars for planned turnarounds at PDH-1, our IBDH, and our high-purity isobutylene facility. These scheduled turnarounds typically occur every three-to-four years for these type plants. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $29 billion as of December 31, 2023. Assuming the final maturity date of our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio was approximately 19 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.6%. At December 31, approximately 96% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $3.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, which includes availability of our credit facilities and unrestricted cash. Adjusted EBITDA, as Jim mentioned earlier, was $9.3 billion for 2023. We ended the year with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0 times on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and reduced by partnerships unrestricted cash on hand. Our leverage target remains three times, plus or minus a quarter term, so 2.75 times to 3.25 times. In January, we issued $2 billion of senior notes comprised of $1 billion of three-year notes at a coupon of 4.6% and $1 billion of 10-year notes at a 4.85% coupon. The proceeds from this offering will go toward an upcoming $850 million debt maturity in February, I guess this month, and funding our capital expenditure program. We appreciate the continued support of our debt investors. Moving on to future events, Enterprise will host an analyst and investor call on Wednesday, April 3. This will be in lieu of our in-person analyst day. This call will include overviews on our current outlook, near-term objectives, allocation of capital, as well as fundamentals updates from Tony. Q&A will follow our prepared remarks. More information will be provided in the coming weeks. Before we open the call up to questions, Jim and I would like to take a moment to recognize Randy Burkhalter, our Vice President of Investor Relations. After a 46-year career in the energy industry, Randy has announced his retirement for April of this year. Randy has led our investor relations effort for the past 21 years, when he joined us shortly after our acquisition of the Mid-America and Seminole pipelines. Through the annual Institutional Investor Magazine, all American team surveys, Enterprise and our investor relations team have been consistently recognized by the sell side and buy side community as one of the best in the midstream sector. Randy has been integral to leading this effort. We are grateful for Randy's service, his integrity, his attention to customer service, and his industry-renowned social prowess. Please join us in congratulating Randy on his 46-year career and a job well done. Most of you have met Libby Strait. Libby will succeed Randy in leading our IR effort. Libby is one of our young All-Stars who joined the company in 2013 and worked in commercial roles of increasing responsibility across several of our business units before joining the IR team 2019. She and Michael Cisarik, another one of our All-Stars, will comprise our IR team.\nJim Teague: Randy, as it relates to Randy Burkhalter, I think it's fair to say we have already scheduled a quarterly visit by Randy to the building to have a couple of scotches back of our downtown at least once a quarter.\nRandy Fowler: With that, I think we're now ready to open the call-up to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats, Randy. And Jim, please send me the invite for the scotch. Get together. I wanted to start with maybe your latest views on Permian growth in 2024, both for oil and for gas. And then kind of a related topic. Clearly, there seems like there will be need for another Permian gas takeaway. You had talked about a Brownfield project a little while back. It's been kind of quiet lately. So I wanted to get your latest thoughts on Permian gas takeaway solution in light of your growth outlook.\nTony Chovanec: Hey, Michael, this is Tony. In our last analyst meeting, which was March of 2023, we talked about growth in the United States of, call it, 1.8 million barrels. I'll just go to oil right now. We gave you some basic metrics as to what happens with the oil. But 1.8 million barrels in the 23, 24, 25 time frame. Obviously, there was a lot of pushback when we published that forecast from all sides, including producers that hadn't looked at the number like we had. And what I'll say about that number now, of that 1.8, we said 1.5 in the Permian basin. Certainly, given the performance of producers during 2023, the producer community is on track to meet and likely beat those numbers. And I don't know how that changes at this pace. And then the combined growing wedge of PDP that a lot of people forget about in key basins, coupled with the continuous improvement in efficiency and productivity that we see from the producer community. So we'll talk about it more in early April, but I'll -- I think the clip notes now, what we know is, it's really going to be hard not to at least meet and likely beat that number as we look at the three year period, very much Permian dominated. Relative to gas pipelines we've talked about a simple metrics before for every million barrels incremental that you have with oil, you have somewhere in the neighborhood of available 400,000 to 500,000 barrels of NGLs. And for rich gas, call that anywhere from 3.25 to 3.5 Bcf. Okay. So you do the math, you look at what we have today and incremental capacity over the next two years is coming on is appreciable. Will there need to be more between now and 2030? Yes, the answer that yes, in some form or fashion. Whether it be brownfield, on existing pipes or another Greenfield pipe.\nMichael Blum: Okay, great. Thanks for all that, Tony, maybe we'll just stand gas. My second question just wanted to ask about the pause in LNG permitting and I know you're not, you don't have an LNG asset per se. Curious how if at all this would impact your business in 2024 and beyond. Thanks.\nJim Teague: Okay, Michael, this is Jim. And I guess I wonder, is it truly a pause? Or is it something more? And with those will those projects that are not under construction, but going through the regulatory process be allowed to continue to go through that process during this quote, temporary pause, or will all work stop. Our fundamentals group says we'll have 75 years of reserves at current production with current technology. Our own -- you look at it, our LNG has had a huge difference to our allies. In 2019, we averaged 1.85 Bcf a day to Europe. And 2023, we exported on average 7.5 Bcf a day with a winter peak of over nine Bcf a day. We went from less than 10% market share LNG into Europe, 50% market share. Now Rusty Braziel in his RBN blog this morning has an excellent write up on this issue. So really, you have to sit back and wonder, is this a temporary pause? Or is it a political pause?\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Neel Mitra with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nNeel Mitra: Hi, good morning. Congratulations, Randy. First question was on the NGL exports and hitting a quarterly record. Could you maybe comment on the export dynamics right now? Just with weaker PDH demand and the plants coming up slower than normal, but also lower NGL prices in the U.S. and how that probably is trending to 2024.\nTug Hanley: Yes, this is this is Tug Hanley. So we've had strong operational performance on our EHT asset, which has led to healthy volumes going across the dock. There's also been a decrease in freight values we've seen, which is continuing to support stronger FOB values. With respect to the weaker PDH margins on an international level, the PDH margins have improved, but there's still a lot of overcapacity. So necessarily weak, weak margins don't lead to decreased NGL demand, because it's still the demand is still ultimately there.\nNeel Mitra: Got it. And then my second question is related to Bahia. And I was just wondering if you could maybe give some puts and takes as to where you can see additional volumes picked up. Believe Navitas isn't going through your system right now, maybe the lucid volumes come up for, for re-contracting and in kind of later in the decade, and where you could see some additional opportunities to pick up volumes that aren't contracted onto your system right now.\nJustin Kleiderer: And you know, it's Justin Kleiderer. Yes, so kind of like three buckets of Bahia that we think about first and foremost is our growing GMP footprint. So you think about a metric of every new gas plant we put on, we yield about 40,000 barrels to 45,000 barrels a day of NGLs into Bahia. So we're growing our footprint both in the Delaware and the Midland. So that's always the base load as we think about Bahia. And then on top of that, we have a robust set of third-party agreements. We've got 40 connections on our wide-grade system that gives us a lot of diversity to go capture incremental third-party volumes as that market ebbs and flows. And we've got a good runway of contracts on those that get us to the back end of the decade without having to really worry about any contract roll-off. And then third, kind of our expectation is that Seminole won't be an NGL service once Bahia comes online. You add all those up and that's kind of how we land on the capacity that we created out of the gate at 600 a day.\nNeel Mitra: And Natalie, do you think we're through building processing plants up there?\nNatalie Gayden: I don't think we're through.\nNeel Mitra: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. You may proceed.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. I'd like to echo the congratulations to Randy on his retirement after a stellar career. We wish you continued social progress and also congratulations to Libby and Michael. When we look at your organic projects backlog, it's a robust set of opportunities. And as we look beyond 2025, just trying to think about what a run rate should be, knowing that you still do have some projects under development and some of them sizable. Is that three or three plus billion dollar number a good run rate or how should we think about that?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Theresa, I'll start off. We're $6.8 billion worth of projects under construction. And again, this year, it'll range from three, three and a quarter to $3.75 billion. 2025 is $3 billion. And then there's a little bit of roll off with that $6.8 billion that creeps over into 2026. The one thing I would just note is in that $6.8 billion, we've got two lumpy projects being Bahia Pipeline and also the export facility that we're building on the Neches River. And so if I come in and look forward and the expectation will continue to see build out with natural gas processing, with the gas gathering and compression that supports that. I keep coming back that I really think that going forward, absent spot that we're more in the $2 billion range is where I keep coming out just again, because we've had some lumpy projects. We just put PDH 2 into service in 2023. That was another lumpy project. So just don't foresee a lot of those lumpy projects coming with the exception of SPOT.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. Thank you.\nRandy Fowler: I think with SPOT that\u2019s probably a 3-year construction cycle.\nTheresa Chen: Understood. And in terms of projects that are coming online near term for your Texas West product system, can you remind us how much of that is underwritten by third party commitments versus open capacity that you hope to market and capture that ARB, especially in light of the fact that, since you announced the project, one of your midstream competitors who also has significant marketing capabilities bought a huge refined product system and is also looking to close PAD 2 and PAD 4 ARBs.\nJustin Kleiderer: Hey, Theresa, it's Justin Kleiderer again. And Tug may chime in on a piece of that as well. But as we develop the project, it's really it really has developed into really a rack marketing model. We had the first phase of startup really impending and the timing of the rest of it should be lined out in the deck. But we've got significant interest. We've got 40 third party contracts agreed to across the terminals and we're signing up more seemingly daily. So people are just itching for it to come on. But we do think similar to Dixie and our legacy propane long haul pipelines being sort of an uncontracted rack-based model, that that's the model that we're going to see on TW.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonette with JPMorgan Securities. You may proceed.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. And Randy, I want to wish you congratulations here. Good luck with everything going forward. You will be missed, and thank you.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: And I just wanted to start off, I guess, with the recent Houston ship channel enhancements that we've seen over time here. I'm wondering if you could comment on how that's impacted your LPG export capabilities. Have you seen any kind of improvements there given the changes? Just curious how that has developed.\nRobert Sanders: Yes, this is Bob Sanders. Late in the fourth quarter last year, the Houston pilots removed the daylight restriction on LPG ships. So we can sail 24 hours a day loaded or empty. And we are incrementally picking up the number of vessels we're bringing in to try to maximize the utilization of the refrigeration units that we've got right now. So we are seeing a direct benefit.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Just curious if that's a minor or maybe, bigger expansion. And also, Tony, I guess I'm curious, I guess, with thoughts on LPG pricing here. I guess there's a concern in the marketplace that LPG exports might be maxed out and that could dislocate domestic pricing relative to international price markers. So just wondering how you see that playing out.\nTony Chovanec: I'll answer the first piece a little bit. We're seeing about a 5% to 7% gain at this point.\nRandy Fowler: I think on pricing, you've seen NGLs catch a bid here recently. I think some of what Bob mentioned has helped with pricing. As freights come off, there's been a benefit to certainly to propane and butane on the flat price. But if you look at the growth that Tony mentioned earlier, we have NGLs growing at a faster pace than crude oil. We're seeing it across our system. Storage is going to become more increasingly valuable. These expansions don't come on until 25, 26 timeframe. So we expect the docs to remain at capacity. And then ultimately, the flat price of NGLs will be reflective of that.\nTug Hanley: Yes, this is Tug. I'll just add that we're actually seeing that already manifest itself on our spot. Doc values are upwards of double digits right now.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS. You may proceed.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone and Randy. Thanks again for all the time you spent with me and the community over the last 21 years. And thanks for leaving the team in good hands with Libby and Michael.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Brian.\nBrian Reynolds: Maybe to start off on the NGL macro. Jim, on the last call, you kind of talked about competitive market dynamics, right now, where EPD seems to be threading the needle of maximizing return while preventing some new entrants into the integrated NGL value chain. While I appreciate some of the opening remarks from Tony to Michael's question around Permian growth, just kind of curious how we should think about maybe, volume growth is going to be really attractive over the next few years, but kind of curious if we can talk about how transportation fracking export rates, should look relative to, what they've been the past decade, just really attractive. Thanks.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Hey, Brian, this is Brian. I mean, it kind of varies based on the service. I think everything that you see on a processing side, certainly on the kind of long haul pipeline is a new build economic type number. Fractionation is probably in that group, too. I think when you look across NGL docs, and you look at the entrants that are in that space right now, I think anybody who wants to be in that space is going to have to compete with brownfield economics. And if you look at where FOB values are going for both ethane and LPGs, it is incredibly, incredibly difficult to make a project accretive that's a new entrant in that space.\nBrian Reynolds: So, Brian put directly, while Tug says on our spot deals we have double digit terminaling values, what can you do a five-year deal at?\nTug Hanley: I think when you look at, I don't want to be totally specific on this, but the fees on LPGs are considerably less than what we're seeing today. I don't think anybody's going to go out there and try to justify a project based on values that we see today, because we have capacity that we're contracting. I think others have capacity that are contracting. And then on the FA and piece, that's a very competitive market. I would have a hard time thinking enterprise would be in that market if we hadn't been one of the first ones in that market.\nBrian Reynolds: So you couldn't build a Greenfield terminal based on what we think the terminating fees are going to be.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Absolutely not.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Thanks. Appreciate all that. As my follow up, maybe just an update on the spot license and permit process. You alluded to some comments around the LNG and maybe have some having some impacts on the upcoming U.S. elections. Just kind of curious if we should see any risks to the timeline around the spot licensing and permitting process relative to maybe expectations from last year. Thanks.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Hang on Bob. Brian, I didn't, I didn't say anything about the elections, by the way. Right now we haven't, we've got a record of decision and I'll let Bob tell you what else we've got. But right now, we don't see anything that should preclude us getting that license.\nRobert Sanders: So where we are with, with, with Mirad [ph] we, we have completed all the requirements to receive the license. We're in constant contact with Mirad [ph]. As a matter of fact, we have seen a draft of the license, which they asked us to comment on, which we've commented on, and they've accepted our changes. So everything is basically done. We're just waiting on knowledge that we've got the license.\nBrian Reynolds: Great to hear. I'll leave it there. Enjoy the rest of your day. And thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. He may proceed.\nNeal Dingmann: Morning all thanks for the time and Randy, congrats and look forward to hearing what's next for you. I can only imagine. My first question is on guys on marketing specifically. I just wanted to did you\u2019ll capture some of the commodity price volatility experience with this last, I guess I'd call it the January cold snap, perhaps in Waha or the HSC spreads.\nBrent Secrest: Neal, this is Brent. We were able to capture some, there were some kind of puts and takes on that whole, the whole weather event. There were some operational issues that we had in Midland that are, that are getting fixed. But from a marketing perspective, there was, there was some arbitrage capture on our side. And we pulled all our references, what you're saying.\nNeal Dingmann: Great. And then my second question, just on the PDH plan, just wanted to sound like for the second quarter row, you all mentioned a bit of operational challenges, maybe with the reactor and licenses issue. I'm just wondering, I think Randy, or for Graham, you mentioned, I think last quarter, you thought they'd maybe be more one off and just wondering, has something changed here and maybe just talked about your sort of future view of the ops there.\nUnidentified Company Representative: This is Graham [ph]. Yes, we did have some operating issues in the fourth quarter with the PDH plan. Some of those are related, some of those related to some construction related startup issues, some design issues. At this point, we think we've got, the unit is up and operating. We're not quite at 100% capacity, but we've got line of sight on the fixes that will be taking place here soon. And I think at that point, we can expect we'll have a good operating unit, all the other parameters of the unit that we look at in terms of robustness and ability to maintain operation are really looking good right now. There's just one, one issue, one more issue we've got to get passed on. I think we'll be looking at a good unit there.\nNeal Dingmann: Very good. Thanks for the details, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. You may proceed.\nTristan Richardson: Hi, good morning, guys. Congrats to Randy. We appreciate all the time you spent with us over the years. Mr. Fowler, you guys have framed up the return of capital slide for a long time. And we've seen that payout ratio that adjusted payout ratio increase over time. And just curious what the stability you're seeing in the earnings base and the stability you're seeing in CapEx sort of as you mentioned over the long-term do you see that payout ratio changing meaningfully over time or is there a way to think about a long-term target for that adjusted cash flow ratio, particularly when you sit in such an advantage position from a leveraged standpoint?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. I'm thinking of how to frame that because you had quite a bit in there. Several of our peers in the energy sector have come in with a formulaic approach on returning capital. And I think we've just been hesitant to doing that because we live in a very dynamic world and opportunities come up. And so really coming in and locking into a formula of so much distribution and so much buyback, more often than not, when I've seen companies come in with those formulas, they're forever tweaking them or rescinding them. And they really have a short shelf life. I really just come back and look at, Jim went through some of our history of returning capital for our first 25 years. We're going to continue to come in and do that as far as distribution growth. I think you've seen over the last two or three years, we're back to mid-single digit distribution growth, which is good to be there. And then we've been doing buybacks steadily on this. And I think if obviously if we come into an era where we're not spending as much CapEx, then we'll have more flexibility to come in and do buybacks. There'll still be opportunistic buybacks. And I think you saw that when the third quarter, the unit price was really pretty strong and we just opted not to come in and do any buybacks in the third quarter of 2023. But when we got into year-end tax selling and saw the weakness in 2024, we executed buybacks at a better level, even considering the distribution that we the November distribution, we still executed at a better buyback level in the fourth quarter than what was available in the third quarter. So I think we'll continue to be opportunistic going forward. And then I think we just need to see what kind of opportunities that we have in the future. But again, I come back in and I don't know of another midstream maybe other than what's the Canadian? Or Canada that has successfully returned capital the way that we have over the last 25 years. So that was long winded, but I hope that helps.\nTristan Richardson: I appreciate it, Randy. And then maybe just on the earlier question to ask it a different way. I think, given the pace of NGO pipeline volumes today, plus Tony's forecast and Justin's earlier comments, is there an opportunity for the capacity of the year to expand as you progress through construction as we go into 2025 or are we seeing enough competing pipes in the market where this should be pretty balanced in 2025.\nJustin Kleiderer: Yes, Tristan, we this Justin, we picked 600 for the reasons before, but you think of a 30 inch pipeline. If it's fully horsepower, it could do upwards of a million. But we're trying to be capital efficient about how we phase into it. So if our forecast are right and we need more than what we have today, we can add pumps on it to upsize it.\nTristan Richardson: Appreciate it. Thank you guys very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Good morning and congrats as well. Randy, you've definitely been one of the most helpful and friendly IR people that I've gotten a chance to work with. So thank you. Wanted to start just on the outlook, like the outlook for the year. So understanding, you're not giving the employee goal for EBITDA for 2024. At a high level, though, you had a lot of momentum exiting 2023 in your results. You have a fair amount of capital and during service with PDH-2 and a couple of plants. You're still constructive on volumes. Is it fair to say 2024 should be a relatively stronger growth year? Or are there any headwinds or things you would point to versus 2023 that could be an offset?\nJim Teague: This is Jim. I think 2024 is shaping up to be a better year than 2023. It's not just the assets we've brought on. We're seeing, for example, and Brent's got some information, our processing margins on what is not fee-based is looking better. You might want to address that.\nBrent Secrest: Yes, if we just look at the fourth quarter on what -- we have floors in our processing contracts, especially around the Midland Basin. So in the fourth quarter, I think those floors were at around, they were all hit at about 97% of those contracts hit the floor. In fact, December was 100%. So as things get more constructive on gas, we'll see if that happens. Certainly, there were some benefits in January. We're seeing some benefits in the current month on NGLs. But that number is probably around 62% in January that hit the floor. So I think from a processing standpoint, there's definitely benefits across the portfolio that we'll see.\nKeith Stanley: Okay, thank you.\nBrent Secrest: It seems like each quarter, we transport more and more hydrocarbons.\nKeith Stanley: Right, yes, Q4 volumes are definitely strong.\nRandy Fowler: And Keith, this is Randy. I think the other thing is, just as you, I think we've, again, we've got a pretty good track record that if you look out over time, our average return on capital has been, I mean, it's when you look at the total company has ranged from 10% to 13%. And then when you come in and you look at the CapEx, specifically the projects that we're putting into service and the level of capital expenditures that we have, I think what that translates to over a three, four year period is probably mid-single digit EBITDA growth. Now, you're not going to be able to use a ruler on that number, but that's about what it works out to be. And then, then you may have some variability in and around that kind of number. But I think if you come back in and just look at what we've been able to do in the past and look at the amount of capital investment that we're making, I think that's where it would take you.\nJim Teague: The other thing is look at our, our people are relentless in visiting customers and getting new deals. I've been shocked at the appetite, for example, for our ethane export doc. And so we're probably going to build new processing plants in the Permian, and I would expect that we're going to fill up our ethane export docs and our LPG docs. The other thing we're seeing is more crude flows to Houston. So we're seeing more crude across our docs.\nKeith Stanley: That's all very helpful. And Jim, if I can kind of follow up on that last point, the NGL export volumes were very strong in Q4, and you noted the removal of the daylight restrictions helping you. Can you give a sense of how close the company is to its capacity based on that Q4 export number? Are you able to keep increasing exports this year before some of the expansions start up in 2025?\nJim Teague: I think if you look at NGLs as a whole and maybe crude oil, yes. If you look at LPG, I think things are going to be tight in terms of doc space on LPG. That gets resolved probably mid next year, but for 2024 and maybe part of 2025, LPG's going to be pretty tight. You have something?\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi, good morning. Do you forecast Permian processing utilization staying as tight as it is now over the next couple of years? Said another way, is it a stretch to say that the timing of processing coming on will dictate the pace of Permian growth in your view?\nBrent Secrest: I think, Jean Ann, and this is Brent, I expect it to stay tight. When we look at our build out and the contracts that come on, there may be a short little window that there's excess capacity, but it fills up very quickly. We'll lean on Tony for his forecast, but what Tony has told us in years past has certainly come true. If not, it's been even more prolific. And then when you look at capacity right now, I think there is gas that's being held back in the basin. It's waiting on compression and it's waiting on processing capacity.\nBrent Secrest: That's exactly what I was going to say. It's not just processing. Some of it's gathering compression in the field that's behind. Once we see that bottleneck kind of get fixed, we'll see processing get full very quickly.\nJean Ann Salisbury: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then one more. There's some discussion of upcoming Haynesville gas pipelines possibly being delayed due to legal issues. Is there any further expansion potential on Acadian or is that maxed out here?\nBrent Secrest: We're maxed out after our last expansion. I'd say we may be a benefactor if that project is late. However, Haynesville is flat to staying flat. Would you say that, Tony?\nTony Chovanec: Yes. Jean Ann, there's so much discussion about the Haynesville and what's going to happen. And honestly, I'm somewhat befuddled by it. And I think that's the right term. We've got LNG coming on in the Louisiana area. The call it is 4.5 to 5 Bcf over the next two years. And that's a big number. And it has -- there's nothing that the whole permitting thing that has recently happened that Jim addressed so well this morning, it impacts that. So we think that -- or we talk like Louisiana and the Haynesville has a chance to go to hell in a hand basket. And I'm sorry. I just don't see it. Unless I'm missing something. The Haynesville, last but not least, is one of the primary basins for a massive amount of long-term storage of gas reserves. No question about it. So we still see it as an ideal and kind of a cornerstone basin for us relative to natural gas.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. Thanks for that, Tony. And thank you, Randy, for all of your help over the years. You'll be missed. That's all for me.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi. You may proceed.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning, team. Two very quick follow-ups from me. One, Randy, just want to go back to the distribution growth and follow up on Tristan's question. The cadence the last two years or so has been an increase about every two quarters, tracking around that 5% annual growth. I know you like to keep us guessing. So as we think going forward, how opportunistic is the distribution growth from here? Or is that something we should really kind of expect going forward?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Spiro, again, I just go back to our track record. We don't like to get out in front and run our board. But again, I think with the CapEx we're deploying and the return on capital that we're expecting to get, I think coming in, and we've been increasing distribution 25 years in a row. And I feel pretty good about 2026. And we've been doing it around mid-single digits.\nSpiro Dounis: All right. Fair enough. Second one, just around M&A, you all purchased some natural gas storage assets around the quarter. Pretty small for you, so I don't want to read into it too much. But just curious, is this sort of the beginning of a bigger push into natural gas storage? Or is it more opportunistic? As you look at the rest of your asset base, are there more opportunities like this to vote on?\nRandy Fowler: That's at Wilson Storage that we've leased for years and years. And in the contract, they had the right to put it to us. And they put it to us. And it was a reasonable price. So we weren't upset. And that was legacy going back to GulfTerra Energy Partners. We sort of inherited that when we acquired GulfTerra.\nSpiro Dounis: Okay. Perfect. Thanks, guys. I will save my project 10 questions for the April call. Thanks, everyone.\nRandy Burkhalter: Josh, this is Randy. Let me cut in. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. And our next question comes from John McKay with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nJohn Mckay: Hey, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the time. I just wanted to touch one more time on the export side, understand that FOB spreads, FOB premiums are really high right now. But you talked about kind of outer coming down farther. Is it really just, we are going to see these rates stay high until yours and your kind of competitors' projects come online in 2025? Or would you expect some benefit there once or if the Panama Canal starts to clear up?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, we expect the rates to remain elevated until the expansion comes online from us and our competitors. We call that mid-25. But with respect to the Panama Canal issues and even issues in the Red Sea, really I haven't seen that impact the FOB values too much. The VLGC fleet has done a really good job at repositioning itself. There's over 380 VLGCs on the water to help mitigate those issues. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we've seen freight come down. So I don't really see that impacting the FOB values too much from the Canal.\nJohn Mckay: How many VLGCs came on in 2023? How many do we expect in 2024?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, I was calling around north of 40 VLGCs came online in 2023. And there's going to be another 22 or so come online in 2024.\nJohn Mckay: All right. That's great. I appreciate that. And maybe just one more clarification from earlier. I appreciated the color on the fee floors on processing in the Permian. Just one thing we wanted to try to frame up. I mean, if we look year-over-year, Permian processing volumes are up about half a B, but margins effectively flat. Just curious if you can comment, is that all commodity impact or is there some kind of underlying deflation on the fee side as well?\nRandy Fowler: All commodity. All right. Makes sense. That's it for me. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Randy Burkhalter for any closing remarks.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Josh. Before we close out, I'd like to thank Randy for the kind comments and the offer from EGEMP [ph]. And many thanks to all of you I've worked with for the years.\nJim Teague: He's getting a little emotional. Thank you. Close it out, Libby.\nLibby Strait: And I guess with that, we'll end the call. Thanks to everyone for your participation.\nJim Teague: Thank you. Randy, you're great.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "And you know, it's Justin Kleiderer. Yes, so kind of like three buckets of Bahia that we think about first and foremost is our growing GMP footprint. So you think about a metric of every new gas plant we put on, we yield about 40,000 barrels to 45,000 barrels a day of NGLs into Bahia. So we're growing our footprint both in the Delaware and the Midland. So that's always the base load as we think about Bahia. And then on top of that, we have a robust set of third-party agreements. We've got 40 connections on our wide-grade system that gives us a lot of diversity to go capture incremental third-party volumes as that market ebbs and flows. And we've got a good runway of contracts on those that get us to the back end of the decade without having to really worry about any contract roll-off. And then third, kind of our expectation is that Seminole won't be an NGL service once Bahia comes online. You add all those up and that's kind of how we land on the capacity that we created out of the gate at 600 a day. Hey, Theresa, it's Justin Kleiderer again. And Tug may chime in on a piece of that as well. But as we develop the project, it's really it really has developed into really a rack marketing model. We had the first phase of startup really impending and the timing of the rest of it should be lined out in the deck. But we've got significant interest. We've got 40 third party contracts agreed to across the terminals and we're signing up more seemingly daily. So people are just itching for it to come on. But we do think similar to Dixie and our legacy propane long haul pipelines being sort of an uncontracted rack-based model, that that's the model that we're going to see on TW. Yes, Tristan, we this Justin, we picked 600 for the reasons before, but you think of a 30 inch pipeline. If it's fully horsepower, it could do upwards of a million. But we're trying to be capital efficient about how we phase into it. So if our forecast are right and we need more than what we have today, we can add pumps on it to upsize it."

            "name": "Tony Chovanec",
            "content": "Hey, Michael, this is Tony. In our last analyst meeting, which was March of 2023, we talked about growth in the United States of, call it, 1.8 million barrels. I'll just go to oil right now. We gave you some basic metrics as to what happens with the oil. But 1.8 million barrels in the 23, 24, 25 time frame. Obviously, there was a lot of pushback when we published that forecast from all sides, including producers that hadn't looked at the number like we had. And what I'll say about that number now, of that 1.8, we said 1.5 in the Permian basin. Certainly, given the performance of producers during 2023, the producer community is on track to meet and likely beat those numbers. And I don't know how that changes at this pace. And then the combined growing wedge of PDP that a lot of people forget about in key basins, coupled with the continuous improvement in efficiency and productivity that we see from the producer community. So we'll talk about it more in early April, but I'll -- I think the clip notes now, what we know is, it's really going to be hard not to at least meet and likely beat that number as we look at the three year period, very much Permian dominated. Relative to gas pipelines we've talked about a simple metrics before for every million barrels incremental that you have with oil, you have somewhere in the neighborhood of available 400,000 to 500,000 barrels of NGLs. And for rich gas, call that anywhere from 3.25 to 3.5 Bcf. Okay. So you do the math, you look at what we have today and incremental capacity over the next two years is coming on is appreciable. Will there need to be more between now and 2030? Yes, the answer that yes, in some form or fashion. Whether it be brownfield, on existing pipes or another Greenfield pipe. I'll answer the first piece a little bit. We're seeing about a 5% to 7% gain at this point. Yes. Jean Ann, there's so much discussion about the Haynesville and what's going to happen. And honestly, I'm somewhat befuddled by it. And I think that's the right term. We've got LNG coming on in the Louisiana area. The call it is 4.5 to 5 Bcf over the next two years. And that's a big number. And it has -- there's nothing that the whole permitting thing that has recently happened that Jim addressed so well this morning, it impacts that. So we think that -- or we talk like Louisiana and the Haynesville has a chance to go to hell in a hand basket. And I'm sorry. I just don't see it. Unless I'm missing something. The Haynesville, last but not least, is one of the primary basins for a massive amount of long-term storage of gas reserves. No question about it. So we still see it as an ideal and kind of a cornerstone basin for us relative to natural gas."

            "content": "Yes, this is this is Tug Hanley. So we've had strong operational performance on our EHT asset, which has led to healthy volumes going across the dock. There's also been a decrease in freight values we've seen, which is continuing to support stronger FOB values. With respect to the weaker PDH margins on an international level, the PDH margins have improved, but there's still a lot of overcapacity. So necessarily weak, weak margins don't lead to decreased NGL demand, because it's still the demand is still ultimately there. Yes, this is Tug. I'll just add that we're actually seeing that already manifest itself on our spot. Doc values are upwards of double digits right now. I think when you look at, I don't want to be totally specific on this, but the fees on LPGs are considerably less than what we're seeing today. I don't think anybody's going to go out there and try to justify a project based on values that we see today, because we have capacity that we're contracting. I think others have capacity that are contracting. And then on the FA and piece, that's a very competitive market. I would have a hard time thinking enterprise would be in that market if we hadn't been one of the first ones in that market."

            "name": "Jim Teague",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. We generated $7.6 billion of distributable cash flow in 2023, providing 1.7 times coverage, and we retained $3.2 billion. We set nine financial records and 13 operating records in 2013. Our 2023 operating results included records in NGL pipeline transportation, ethane exports, total NGL marine terminal volumes, NGL fractionation volumes, fee based natural gas processing volumes and crude pipeline and natural gas transportation volumes barrels of oil equivalent per day enterprise transported a record 12.2 million barrels a day in 2023, compared to 11.2 million barrels a day in 2022. During the fourth quarter, we transported 12.7 million barrels a day, compared to 11.5 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2022. We exported a record 2.3 million barrels a day of liquid hydrocarbons. That includes everything from crude oil to LPGs to ethane, refined products and basic petrochemicals, ethane and propylene. When you look at our exports, it's clear that enterprise is not a one trick pony. It's quite remarkable that volumes across all our pipes and facilities increased sequentially each quarter in 2023, supported by the strong supply and demand fundamentals for hydrocarbons from the Permian and other basins we serve integrated with the midstream services we have, including exports that we just discussed. Relative to commodity markets, 2023 was a relatively weak year, especially for natural gas and natural gas liquids. Nonetheless, Enterprise proved once again that we don't need really high prices to make substantial returns. The financial records and 13 operating records summarized were achieved in a commodity price environment where natural gas prices were down almost 60% from 2022, crude was down nearly 20%, propane was down 36%, ethane was down almost 50%, and the NGL processing basket was down 35%. Relative to the several 2023 records at our marine terminals, we have long said that hydrocarbons would price to export proven once again in 2023. In growth capital during 2023, we completed construction of $3.5 billion of projects. Significant assets put into service include two new natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin and our 12th NGO fractionator in Chambers County. All of these assets were essentially full after operations began. While production of our PDH 2 facility was completed in the third quarter of 2023, we spent much of the remainder of the year addressing startup issues. As a result, this plant did not meet our expectations and earnings in 2023. We believe most of these issues have been resolved and we anticipate much higher utilization rates this year. We began 2024 with 6.8 billion of major organic projects under construction, with three projects representing approximately $1.1 billion in capital investment expected to be completed this year. Major 2024 projects include our Texas Western Products pipeline system and two additional processing plants in the Permian. We have considerable amount of growth capital underway. All of these projects provide strategic growth to our system and can add considerable disability to new sources of cash flow. I wanted to take a minute to talk about project 9.3. We started this project in 2022 as an incentive for all employees to find innovative ways to improve the bottom line. This was especially important as we in the industry were re-engaged  This was especially important as we in the industry were reengaging after COVID and faced the challenges of a slower global economy in 2023. We achieved the goals we set for ourselves both in 2022 and 2023. We are very proud of our employees for that accomplishment. That said, we will not have a Project 9 type program for 2024. You've always heard me say, if you want to know where we're going, look at what we're doing. The Permian Basin has been the cornerstone for much of our growth capital. As we look at 2024 and beyond, we see supply and demand opportunities as the Permian continues to grow and the world continues to have an ever-increasing appetite for U.S. hydrocarbons. We noted in the press release that these may be the most geopolitically challenging times since World War II, but it's abundantly clear that all of this chaos is leading itself to a growing appetite for the most stable hydrocarbon supplies in the world, the USA, in spite of government and regulatory challenges. Without a doubt, relative to energy, our nation's biggest geopolitical challenges continue to be self-inflicted. Enterprise has one of the world's leading natural gas liquids franchise, and we have the liquids hydrocarbon storage and export franchise. On top of all of that, we have a dedicated employee base that creates value, regardless of the environment. 2023 marked our 25th anniversary as a public company. It's been a great quarter century. It has been for the U.S. energy industry. It included the downfall of the energy merchants, the great financial crisis, the innovation of the E&P and oil field service industries to unlock the potential of the Shell plays, which is still continuing. It included the near-debt and remarkable renaissance of the U.S. petrochemical industry, from having the highest cost feedstock pre-Shell to now the lowest cost. It included two OPEC price wars, a once-in-a-century pandemic, and the re-emergence of geopolitical upheaval. During this time, we stuck to our objectives of investing capital at reasonable returns, providing reliable value-added services to customers, consistently returning capital to our partners, and increasing the value of the partnership for the long-term. During this time, the enterprise value of the partnership has grown from $1.2 billion to almost $90 billion. The value of our partnership units has increased almost 400%. We increased our distribution 25 consecutive years at an approximately 7% compound annual growth rate. We've returned $52 billion of capital to investors through distributions and buybacks. We have high-quality employees, and we thank our employees, we thank our customers, our service providers, our banks, and our investors for their contributions to this success. We're looking forward to the exciting opportunities and challenges for the next 25 years as the world's population, quality of life, and demand for energy reaches new heights. Put frankly, based on what I see in the future for energy, I'd give anything if I could turn the clock back and be 50 years old. With that, I'll turn it over to Randy. Randy, as it relates to Randy Burkhalter, I think it's fair to say we have already scheduled a quarterly visit by Randy to the building to have a couple of scotches back of our downtown at least once a quarter. Okay, Michael, this is Jim. And I guess I wonder, is it truly a pause? Or is it something more? And with those will those projects that are not under construction, but going through the regulatory process be allowed to continue to go through that process during this quote, temporary pause, or will all work stop. Our fundamentals group says we'll have 75 years of reserves at current production with current technology. Our own -- you look at it, our LNG has had a huge difference to our allies. In 2019, we averaged 1.85 Bcf a day to Europe. And 2023, we exported on average 7.5 Bcf a day with a winter peak of over nine Bcf a day. We went from less than 10% market share LNG into Europe, 50% market share. Now Rusty Braziel in his RBN blog this morning has an excellent write up on this issue. So really, you have to sit back and wonder, is this a temporary pause? Or is it a political pause? This is Jim. I think 2024 is shaping up to be a better year than 2023. It's not just the assets we've brought on. We're seeing, for example, and Brent's got some information, our processing margins on what is not fee-based is looking better. You might want to address that. The other thing is look at our, our people are relentless in visiting customers and getting new deals. I've been shocked at the appetite, for example, for our ethane export doc. And so we're probably going to build new processing plants in the Permian, and I would expect that we're going to fill up our ethane export docs and our LPG docs. The other thing we're seeing is more crude flows to Houston. So we're seeing more crude across our docs. I think if you look at NGLs as a whole and maybe crude oil, yes. If you look at LPG, I think things are going to be tight in terms of doc space on LPG. That gets resolved probably mid next year, but for 2024 and maybe part of 2025, LPG's going to be pretty tight. You have something? He's getting a little emotional. Thank you. Close it out, Libby. Thank you. Randy, you're great."

There were some operational issues that we had in Midland that are, that are getting fixed. But from a marketing perspective, there was, there was some arbitrage capture on our side. And we pulled all our references, what you're saying. Yes, if we just look at the fourth quarter on what -- we have floors in our processing contracts, especially around the Midland Basin. So in the fourth quarter, I think those floors were at around, they were all hit at about 97% of those contracts hit the floor. In fact, December was 100%. So as things get more constructive on gas, we'll see if that happens. Certainly, there were some benefits in January. We're seeing some benefits in the current month on NGLs. But that number is probably around 62% in January that hit the floor. So I think from a processing standpoint, there's definitely benefits across the portfolio that we'll see. It seems like each quarter, we transport more and more hydrocarbons. I think, Jean Ann, and this is Brent, I expect it to stay tight. When we look at our build out and the contracts that come on, there may be a short little window that there's excess capacity, but it fills up very quickly. We'll lean on Tony for his forecast, but what Tony has told us in years past has certainly come true. If not, it's been even more prolific. And then when you look at capacity right now, I think there is gas that's being held back in the basin. It's waiting on compression and it's waiting on processing capacity. That's exactly what I was going to say. It's not just processing. Some of it's gathering compression in the field that's behind. Once we see that bottleneck kind of get fixed, we'll see processing get full very quickly. We're maxed out after our last expansion. I'd say we may be a benefactor if that project is late. However, Haynesville is flat to staying flat. Would you say that, Tony?"

            "name": "Randy Fowler",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Starting off with the income statement, the net income attributable to common unit holders for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.6 billion or $0.72 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.4 billion or $0.65 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted cash flow from operations, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital, was $2.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. We declared a distribution of $0.515 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2023, which is a 5.1% increase over the distribution declared for the fourth quarter of 2022. The distribution will be paid February 14th to common unit holders of record as of the close of business on January 31st. In the fourth quarter, the partnership purchased 3.7 million common units off the open market for $96 million. Total purchases for 2023 were $187 million or 7.2 million common units, bringing total purchases under our buyback program to over $900 million. I mentioned it on the last call, looking at our five largest midstream peers by market cap. Since 2019, Enterprise is the only midstream energy company to reduce absolute outstanding units outstanding without significant asset sales. In addition to buybacks, our distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 6.6 million common units on the open market for $172 million during 2023. For 2023, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.3 billion in distributions to limited partners. These distributions combined with the buybacks for the year, resulting in our having a payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations of 56% and a payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow of 94%. Total capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1 billion, which included $823 million for growth capital projects, $65 million for the acquisition of a small natural gas storage facility that we have historically leased, and $129 million of sustaining capital expenditures. Capital investments for the year of 2023 were $3.3 billion, which includes $2.75 billion of organic growth capital projects, $100 million in asset acquisitions, and $413 million of sustaining capital expenditures. During the third quarter call, we estimated $3 billion of organic growth capital expenditures in 2023 and a range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion in 2024. Due to the timing of expenditures, we had approximately $250 million of CapEx shift from 2023 into 2024. Therefore, we now expect our 2024 growth capital expenditures to total $3.25 billion to $3.75 billion. We expect 2024 sustaining CapEx will be approximately $550 million, which includes dollars for planned turnarounds at PDH-1, our IBDH, and our high-purity isobutylene facility. These scheduled turnarounds typically occur every three-to-four years for these type plants. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $29 billion as of December 31, 2023. Assuming the final maturity date of our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio was approximately 19 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.6%. At December 31, approximately 96% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $3.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, which includes availability of our credit facilities and unrestricted cash. Adjusted EBITDA, as Jim mentioned earlier, was $9.3 billion for 2023. We ended the year with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0 times on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and reduced by partnerships unrestricted cash on hand. Our leverage target remains three times, plus or minus a quarter term, so 2.75 times to 3.25 times. In January, we issued $2 billion of senior notes comprised of $1 billion of three-year notes at a coupon of 4.6% and $1 billion of 10-year notes at a 4.85% coupon. The proceeds from this offering will go toward an upcoming $850 million debt maturity in February, I guess this month, and funding our capital expenditure program. We appreciate the continued support of our debt investors. Moving on to future events, Enterprise will host an analyst and investor call on Wednesday, April 3. This will be in lieu of our in-person analyst day. This call will include overviews on our current outlook, near-term objectives, allocation of capital, as well as fundamentals updates from Tony. Q&A will follow our prepared remarks. More information will be provided in the coming weeks. Before we open the call up to questions, Jim and I would like to take a moment to recognize Randy Burkhalter, our Vice President of Investor Relations. After a 46-year career in the energy industry, Randy has announced his retirement for April of this year. Randy has led our investor relations effort for the past 21 years, when he joined us shortly after our acquisition of the Mid-America and Seminole pipelines. Through the annual Institutional Investor Magazine, all American team surveys, Enterprise and our investor relations team have been consistently recognized by the sell side and buy side community as one of the best in the midstream sector. Randy has been integral to leading this effort. We are grateful for Randy's service, his integrity, his attention to customer service, and his industry-renowned social prowess. Please join us in congratulating Randy on his 46-year career and a job well done. Most of you have met Libby Strait. Libby will succeed Randy in leading our IR effort. Libby is one of our young All-Stars who joined the company in 2013 and worked in commercial roles of increasing responsibility across several of our business units before joining the IR team 2019. She and Michael Cisarik, another one of our All-Stars, will comprise our IR team. With that, I think we're now ready to open the call-up to questions. Yes, Theresa, I'll start off. We're $6.8 billion worth of projects under construction. And again, this year, it'll range from three, three and a quarter to $3.75 billion. 2025 is $3 billion. And then there's a little bit of roll off with that $6.8 billion that creeps over into 2026. The one thing I would just note is in that $6.8 billion, we've got two lumpy projects being Bahia Pipeline and also the export facility that we're building on the Neches River. And so if I come in and look forward and the expectation will continue to see build out with natural gas processing, with the gas gathering and compression that supports that. I keep coming back that I really think that going forward, absent spot that we're more in the $2 billion range is where I keep coming out just again, because we've had some lumpy projects. We just put PDH 2 into service in 2023. That was another lumpy project. So just don't foresee a lot of those lumpy projects coming with the exception of SPOT. I think with SPOT that's probably a 3-year construction cycle. I think on pricing, you've seen NGLs catch a bid here recently. I think some of what Bob mentioned has helped with pricing. As freights come off, there's been a benefit to certainly to propane and butane on the flat price. But if you look at the growth that Tony mentioned earlier, we have NGLs growing at a faster pace than crude oil. We're seeing it across our system. Storage is going to become more increasingly valuable. These expansions don't come on until 25, 26 timeframe. So we expect the docs to remain at capacity. And then ultimately, the flat price of NGLs will be reflective of that. Yes. I'm thinking of how to frame that because you had quite a bit in there. Several of our peers in the energy sector have come in with a formulaic approach on returning capital. And I think we've just been hesitant to doing that because we live in a very dynamic world and opportunities come up. And so really coming in and locking into a formula of so much distribution and so much buyback, more often than not, when I've seen companies come in with those formulas, they're forever tweaking them or rescinding them. And they really have a short shelf life. I really just come back and look at, Jim went through some of our history of returning capital for our first 25 years. We're going to continue to come in and do that as far as distribution growth. I think you've seen over the last two or three years, we're back to mid-single digit distribution growth, which is good to be there. And then we've been doing buybacks steadily on this. And I think if obviously if we come into an era where we're not spending as much CapEx, then we'll have more flexibility to come in and do buybacks. There'll still be opportunistic buybacks. And I think you saw that when the third quarter, the unit price was really pretty strong and we just opted not to come in and do any buybacks in the third quarter of 2023. But when we got into year-end tax selling and saw the weakness in 2024, we executed buybacks at a better level, even considering the distribution that we the November distribution, we still executed at a better buyback level in the fourth quarter than what was available in the third quarter. So I think we'll continue to be opportunistic going forward. And then I think we just need to see what kind of opportunities that we have in the future. But again, I come back in and I don't know of another midstream maybe other than what's the Canadian? Or Canada that has successfully returned capital the way that we have over the last 25 years. So that was long winded, but I hope that helps. And Keith, this is Randy. I think the other thing is, just as you, I think we've, again, we've got a pretty good track record that if you look out over time, our average return on capital has been, I mean, it's when you look at the total company has ranged from 10% to 13%. And then when you come in and you look at the CapEx, specifically the projects that we're putting into service and the level of capital expenditures that we have, I think what that translates to over a three, four year period is probably mid-single digit EBITDA growth. Now, you're not going to be able to use a ruler on that number, but that's about what it works out to be. And then, then you may have some variability in and around that kind of number. But I think if you come back in and just look at what we've been able to do in the past and look at the amount of capital investment that we're making, I think that's where it would take you. Yes. Spiro, again, I just go back to our track record. We don't like to get out in front and run our board. But again, I think with the CapEx we're deploying and the return on capital that we're expecting to get, I think coming in, and we've been increasing distribution 25 years in a row. And I feel pretty good about 2026. And we've been doing it around mid-single digits. That's at Wilson Storage that we've leased for years and years. And in the contract, they had the right to put it to us. And they put it to us. And it was a reasonable price. So we weren't upset. And that was legacy going back to GulfTerra Energy Partners. We sort of inherited that when we acquired GulfTerra. Yes, we expect the rates to remain elevated until the expansion comes online from us and our competitors. We call that mid-25. But with respect to the Panama Canal issues and even issues in the Red Sea, really I haven't seen that impact the FOB values too much. The VLGC fleet has done a really good job at repositioning itself. There's over 380 VLGCs on the water to help mitigate those issues. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we've seen freight come down. So I don't really see that impacting the FOB values too much from the Canal. Yes, I was calling around north of 40 VLGCs came online in 2023. And there's going to be another 22 or so come online in 2024. All commodity. All right. Makes sense. That's it for me. Thanks again."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Randy Burkhalter, VP of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Tawanda. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Enterprise Products conference call as we discuss our third quarter earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise\u2019s general partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise\u2019s management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. And so, with that, I will turn it over to you Jim.\nJim Teague: Okay, thank you, Randy. This morning we reported solid results for the third quarter including adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 billion. We had 1.7 times coverage of our distributable cash flow and we retained $773 million. But we had challenges throughout the quarter. Record heat in August and September affected our processing plants throughput and refrigeration at our NGL export facilities and we experienced operational challenges at our PDH plants. We were also challenged by low natural gas and NGL prices, but despite these challenges, we handle record volumes across our midstream system, including our liquids pipelines, natural gas pipelines, NGL fractionators and our marine terminals. In total, our pipelines transported 12.2 million barrels per day of crude oil equivalent. In terms of hydrocarbon exports, we reported 2.1 million barrels a day and while most people focus on crude exports, we focused on hydrocarbon exports. We exported everything from ethylene to crude oil. I think both Randy and I are very optimistic that our folks can do even more with the assets we have. Among some of the highlights so far this year is an unbelievable growing appetite for ethane exports and of course we're expanding our export facility and this demand seems like it's comes from all parts of the world. We're also continuing to see a growing appetite for LPG exports and we're having productive negotiations in anticipation of getting our SPOT license to construct permits soon. Our fundamentals group forecasts have been consistently on the money in the past. We have a lot of confidence in their future outlook. Therefore, this morning we announced an expansion of our NGL franchise. We're going to build two more 300 million cubic feet today processing plants in the Permian, one in the Delaware and one in Midland. When completed, we'll have 19 processing trains in the Permian and 41 company-wide. Today, we also announced that we are converting our 210,000 barrel per day Seminole crude oil pipeline back to NGL service to support our needed Permian NGL take away. In addition, we announced our Bahia 30-inch NGL pipeline that will originate in the Permian and deliver up to 600,000 barrels a day of NGL into our storage system in Chambers County. The beauty of this Seminole pipeline is we can seamlessly switch service between crude, our NGLs are as an expansion of our new TW refined product system.\nFrac:\n14:\nPlatts Dated Brent: Our focus on quality is extremely important to the entire producer community in order to ensure that Gulf Coast crude remains highly desirable in global markets. We've also improved the quality of our Eagle Ford crude oil systems. Not only has it made it easier to sell South Texas wheat, it's improved the price that we get for that crude. Whether it's creating new growth projects or improving the performance of assets we have, our folks Enterprise people, continue to deliver strong financial results and we are exceedingly proud of each and every one of them. With that, I'll turn it over to Randy.\nRandy Fowler: Okay, thank you and good morning everyone. Starting with the income statement items, net income attributable to common unit holders for the third quarter of 2023 was $1.3 billion or $0.60 per common unit on a fully diluted basis, compared to $1.4 billion or $0.62 per common unit on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter of last year. Adjusted cash flow from operations or which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital was $2 billion for the third quarters of both 2023 and 2022. We declared a distribution of $0.50 per common unit for the third quarter of 2023, which is a 5.3% increase over the distribution declared for the third quarter of 2022. The distribution will be paid November 14 to common unitholders of record as of close of business today. This year marks our 25th consecutive year of distribution growth. I guess you can say you can treat that distribution as a treat today. Our dividend reinvestment plan and enterprise unit -- employee unit purchase plan purchased approximately 1.4 million common units on the open market for a total purchase price of approximately $37 million during the third quarter of 2023. Our utilization of the authorized $2 billion buyback program is unchanged at 41% with unit purchases for the first nine months of the year totaling approximately 3.6 million common units for a total purchase price of approximately $92 million. For the 12 months ending September 30, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.3 billion in distributions to limited partners. These distributions combined with $213 million in buybacks for the last 12 months result in Enterprise having a payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations of 56% and a payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow of 90% for that 12-month period. Our buyback activity has been admittedly lumpy over the last 18 months. EPD elected not to buy back equity in the third quarter. During the third quarter buyback window our fee WAP, our volume weighted average price was 98% of our 52-week unit price and we elected to be patient. We fully expect to be back in the market doing buybacks in the fourth quarter. We have established a track record of opportunistic buybacks over the last six years. We will continue to look for opportunistic windows to reduce unit count as we remain focused on improving our cash flow per unit metrics. We recently did a comparison of the six largest North American midstream energy companies, those with a market capitalization over $35 billion. Since 2019, EPD is one of only two companies to have actually reduced common unit/share count and we are the only midstream company to reduce unit count over this time period without material asset sales. EPD reduced its common unit count by approximately 1% over this period, as did our peer. While this is a modest start, it is a consistent start of buybacks for six years in a row. We were also one of only three companies that grew distributable cash flow per unit by 15% or more, in fact, for this group of six midstream energy companies, DPD is the only company to have both reduced unit count and increased DCF per unit. We will include this peer comparison of DCF per unit growth, change in unit count and change in debt in our upcoming investor slide deck after our peers file their third quarter 10-Qs. We believe this will show EPDs balanced approach to increasing the value of the partnership for our limited partners over time. Total capital investments in the third quarter of this year were $826 million which included $722 million for growth projects and $99 million of sustaining cap. Capital investments for the first nine months of 2023 were $2.3 billion, which includes $2 billion organic growth capital projects and $284 million for sustaining capital expenditures. We expect our 2023 growth capital expenditures to total $3 billion. We expect 2023 sustaining capital expenditures will be approximately $400 million. As Jim mentioned earlier, this morning, we also announced $3.1 billion of organic growth projects to expand our core NGL franchise in the most prolific basin in North America. These projects will provide additional natural gas processing and NGL pipeline and fractionation capacity to support continued production growth out of the Permian Basin. These growth projects will also bring additional volumes to our downstream NGL storage, pipeline and marine terminal assets. In addition, facilitating Permian production growth also provides indirect business opportunities for our crude oil and natural gas businesses. With the addition of these four projects, we have $6.8 billion of major growth capital expenditures of projects under construction. We are currently forecasting 2024 growth capital expenditures in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. We do not expect this level of capital investment to impact our distribution growth or our buyback activity in 2024. For 2024, we expect our buyback activity to be consistent with our history of approximately $200 million to $250 million a year. We are confident the returns generated by these organic capital investments in the heart of our NGL value chain will support the continued growth in EPD's cash flow per unit and free cash flow, which will support future returns of capital through both distribution growth and buybacks. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $29.2 billion as of September 30, 2023. Assuming the final maturity date for our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio is approximately 19 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.6%. At September 30, approximately 96% of our debt was fixed rate. In 2024 only $850 million or approximately 3% of our $28.6 billion in term debt obligations which excludes commercial paper actually mature. For the three years 2024 through 2026, only 13% of our term debt obligations mature. The combination of this modest maturity ladder, the average life of our debt portfolio and high percentage of fixed rate debt provide the partnership with ample financial flexibility and provides a solid foundation to grow cash flow per unit. In other words, incremental cash generated from these new projects will not be materially eroded by having to refinance our existing debt portfolio in the current high interest rate environment and thus will better translate into cash flow per unit growth. I do not believe the value of our debt portfolio and liability management is fully appreciated. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter and this includes availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash on hand. Our adjusted EBITDA was $9.2 billion for the trailing 12 months ending September 30, 2023 compared to $9 billion for the trailing 12 months ending September 30, 2022. We ended the quarter with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0 times on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and reduced by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand. Our leverage target remains 3 times plus or minus 0.25, so the range of 2.75 to 3.25 times. With that Randy, we can open it up for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay, thank you, Randy. Tawanda, we're ready now to take questions from our participants and I would just remind our participants that please restrict your questions to one question and one follow up. Okay? Thank you. Tawanda, go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Would you mind providing some more color about what drove the magnitude of the project FIDs at this specific juncture? What changed versus previous expectations, the annual growth CapEx cadence and were some of these projects contemplated earlier in that $2 billion to $2.5 billion CapEx range, but things got more expensive or they are discrete projects that previously weren't in your runway not been brought in?\nRandy Fowler: I guess what changed is the opportunities were there, Theresa and we thought like it is the right time to go. I know there's a lot of questions in the past on Chinook and as we look at what we're doing out in the Permian, we felt like we needed to move on Chinook given that we're going to build two more plants and bringing our plants out there to 19, which is quite a lot of WAG, right? Chris?\nChristian Nelly: Yes, Theresa, this is Chris Nelly. You know, I think what we've been talking about on the last quarter's earnings call was that, we were looking for what was the most effective way to expand our NGL take away capacity out of the basin. And as Jim alluded to with some of the commercial successes we've had in expanding and winning contracts on gas processing capacity, we came to the conclusion that we needed to build the full Bahia pipeline and as a result of that downstream of that you need additional frac capacity. So in our minds that these things go very much hand in hand and it is in the core of our NGL franchise.\nRandy Fowler: And as evidence to that Theresa, we took Seminole's crude service because we need NGL take away right now until the Bahia pipeline gets in service. So Frac #14 will be full and those two processing plants when we bring them on will be full, right Natalie?\nTheresa Chen: Got it. Would you also be able to provide an update on the commercialization progress for SPOT? And would it be possible to maybe move some or all of the ECHO export volumes over to SPOT, maybe supplementing that commercialization effort, if anything? And that would make space, I imagine for incremental NGL exports given that you do see a tremendous amount of NGL growth across your system underlying your project announcement today, which includes expansions nearly along every aspects of your NGL infrastructure value chain except exports?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, we're going to, we're having some productive negotiations with producers and large trading houses on SPOT and frankly I'm getting more optimistic by the day. We have that record of decision. We're still waiting on Bob Sanders, the license to construct which we're hoping that we expect to have by the end of the year.\nRobert Sanders: We're continuing to work with Mayor Ed and the Department of Transportation on moving that forward, so timing is relatively short, yes, Sir.\nRandy Fowler: You got anything, Brent?\nBrent Secrest: No I think overall the momentum on SPOT, it continues to get better and better and the earlier question, this question to me it's what do we believe as a company. I think Tony Chovanec and his group need to take a victory lap for their ability to forecast production and SPOT is going to be about what the Permian Basin does from crude oil and all things and that's what all these projects align toward.\nRandy Fowler: And on to the question on more LPG out of the ship channel, I think everybody knows how much I love the Houston Ship Channel. And the neat thing about the ship, the ship channel is you have two-way traffic. From what I understand daylight restrictions will be lifted November 1st, but then when they widen it that's even -- we can get a lot more traffic coming down that channel, Bob?\nRobert Sanders: Yes Sir, that's absolutely correct. The wider channel is going to allow us to move more product, whether it's LPGs or crude oil or ethane.\nTheresa Chen: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for the question. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nRandy Fowler: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: I just want to come back to capital allocation. I appreciate the deep commentary in the prepared remarks there, but just wanted to kind of come in overlaying once, once these projects tend to service the projects announced today, Enterprise appears well positioned to generate significantly more free cash flow and drop leverage well below three times here it seems. I believe your messaging highlights the ability to return more cash to investors with these projects and maybe could you talk us through how you see Enterprise's capital allocation unfolding and particularly given the potential for lumpiness as you described?\nJim Teague: Yes Jeremy, I think we've demonstrated as far as coming in and consistently, and I'd like to say we balanced the buybacks with continuing to invest in the partnership and grow cash flows per unit. And to me the cash flow per unit growth is the main metric there and leverage. And keeping leverage in check are the -- is really the main metric because the more cash flow per unit you grow eventually this is going to translate into free cash flow, because again, I think our growth CapEx is lumpy over time. We, in 2024 we said we were going to be back in the range of 3 to 3.5 times and some of that is, we have a number of projects. I keep hating to use the word lumpy, but we have some material projects out there whether it's our [indiscernible] river, export our ethane and propane export facility or whether it's the Bahia pipeline that are fairly large projects. Once you get past those, the natural gas processing plants, NGL fractionators are very manageable growth CapEx. SPOT would be out there, if we cannot go ahead and finish commercializing that, but that's something that's going to be spread out over 3, 3.5 years. So I really see the period where we're investing the $3 billion to $3.5 billion a year is pretty limited and so as a result I think once you get out further call it 2025, 2026, 2027, we ought to be flowing off a good bit of free cash flow as you say. Right now, we don't see the need to come in and reduce leverage anymore from where we are today with the target of 3.3 times. So again, that provides more cash for distribution growth and buybacks.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. Thanks. And then just want to pivot back to the projects announced today a little bit more, if I could. And clearly the growing logistics needs associated with robust Permian production is the focal point for midstream here highlighted by your announcement today. And so diving in a little bit more here on the NGL pipe side specifically with today's announcement and the NGL pipe additions appear to outpace I guess the 1.2 million of NGL production growth enterprise 2030, if you look at all the NGL pipes I think talked about in the industry and granted Enterprise has acres dedication and a closed loop system which provides barriers to entry there. But do you see risk to a looser NGL pipeline market down the road and how did Enterprise I guess gain comfort in this size of an NGL pipe?\nJim Teague: You understand what you're talking about the 30-inch Bahia?\nJeremy Tonet: Yes, just give, sorry\u2026\nJim Teague: We felt like that was the right size given what we see. What a lot of people, what I had Tony look into at sometimes is a damn Permian is how about 10 stack pays? Huh?\nTony Chovanec: Probably greater than that particularly on the Delaware side, Jim, it's awesome\u2026\nJim Teague: I mean and then I look at what somebody like Exxon CEO said about getting more efficient and getting better recoveries and I think we're just scratching the surface and I think we'll -- one thing Jim Teague hates and Randy Fowler hates are empty assets and they won't stay empty for long.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. And Jeremy I what I'd add also and I thought the timing was good. Rusted Brazil a note that also highlighted end of last week, end of last week, Tony, you want to hit some of the\u2026\nTony Chovanec: Yes. So look, when we look at our production forecast, the EIA actuals for what those words are worth are supposed to be out today or tomorrow. But if we go through what they have for actuals just through July, they're showing 853,000 barrels of growth in crude oil production for this year so far. Now they've been a very, their data is very hard to set your watch to admittedly, but we had talked about 1.8 million barrels over a three-year period, 2022 through 2025 okay, and then people said well, and you know how do you gauge it year-to-year? And I said well, it's hard to tell, but just divide it evenly. I'll definitely take the overall 600 for 2023 without a doubt for crude oil additions.\nChaparral:\nRandy Fowler: I would look at Enterprise and Permian assets as a portfolio and I think we've demonstrated what Jim said is that we use those pipes for how the market sees fit and I would expect us to do that going forward.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nJim Teague: That was more of an answer than you wanted, wasn't it?\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nTristan Richardson: Hi, good morning all. Just in the context of the NGL production outlook you offered and really how critical and unique the export complex is? Can you talk about the competitive landscape for NGL export capacity? I mean particularly now as some of your peers might like to enter this market either be it in M&A or organically?\nJim Teague: Hi, Tristan, this is Jim. Yes, we keep hearing that. We, I personally think and we made a mistake and maybe it was I made a mistake when we were the only game in town in that we went after pretty high fees when I wish we'd have gone after lower fees because we opened the door for competition. That won't happen again. I don't know how a Greenfield project competes with the brownfield project, especially when you have someone like Enterprise that's going to be damn aggressive in holding market share or even growing it.\nTristan Richardson: Super helpful. I appreciate the context. And then you've talked about all of the folks at Enterprise are very focused and incentivized around Project 9.3. Can you give an update there as we near your end and really, more importantly, any thoughts yet on incentive targets or goals for 2024?\nJim Teague: 9.3 was never intended to be guidance, although every one of you guys took it as such. It was a goal. It was a goal. And I can't remember the last time we missed meeting ago.\nTristan Richardson: I appreciate it. Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi, good morning. There's not really any Gulf Coast LPG export capacity being added until, like, mid-2025. Do you see export capacity getting tight over the next year and a half? And could that be a tailwind for you next year?\nJim Teague: Going to be very tight, Jean Ann.\nJean Ann Salisbury: All right. As a follow up, you obviously announced a lot of organic Permian G&P growth today. Can you talk about how you looked at the pros and cons of organic versus inorganic G&P ads in the Permian, there's obviously a lot of options?\nJim Teague: With organic, you can build plants where you want them. And you don't have to deal with some acquiring a company that has a hell of a lot of dedications to other companies. So, we just \u2013 we can build them where we want them and we control the liquids.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Cool. That's all for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi, good morning, everyone. May be a question for Tony to follow up on some of the Permian fundamentals. Clearly, a lot of these new project announcements are predicated on Permian crude and NGL forecasts going forward. And Jim, you discussed some significant efficiencies that are expected in the Permian through this timeframe. So kind of curious if you can discuss how many of these efficiencies do we need to show up for these numbers to be realized, in your view? And then second kind of what does this imply for permitting rig count going forward? Just seeing that we have seen some weakness going forward, but the medium term outlook still seems to be intact. Thanks.\nTony Chovanec: I'll start out when we did our forecast, we projected what activity was going to be. So Permian rig counts, we said, would range between 315 and 320, and they've ranged between 300 and 325, so not hard math there. For frac cruise, we estimated between 135 and 150, and they're between 145 and 160. It's producers' behavior. And look, they're our customers. We talk to them. We plan projects and capital hand in hand with them. So we have a significant amount of what I'd call institutional knowledge.\nJim Teague: Tony, let me ask, when your forecast, did you all build in any growing efficiencies? Or did you no\u2026\nTony Chovanec: That's a great question. We do not put a coefficient in there for growing efficiencies, and they've been growing for 10 years. I don't know what stops them at this point. But, Jim, to your point, there are about 80 producers that have rigs working in the Permian basin today out of those 80, only 20 of them have five or greater rigs running. Okay? There is significant upside as far as that 60 producers that have less than five rigs running. There's a lot of metrics you can look at, but that's a simple one. That's the reality.\nRandy Fowler: And I guess, Tony, also the forecast that your team worked on did not assume a higher recovery of reserves.\nTony Chovanec: No, sir, it did not. It assumes historical recoveries, which are in the high single digits, Randy. Now, we all know that at least two majors have said that that is not how they are forecasting going forward.\nJim Teague: So [indiscernible] and all that would be using a Louisiana term, lan-yap, a little something extra, Brian.\nBrian Reynolds: Great, thanks. I appreciate the color on that. Maybe just a quick follow up on the Permian natural gas liquids. Seminal conversion seems to be catered towards the highest margin molecule, whether that's crude and natural gas liquids or I think you kind of referenced refined products in your prepared remarks going forward. So just given the opportunities for SPOT in 2025 plus Petchem 2025 plus, how should we think about maybe opportunities for Shin Oak and Seminole, kind of just go to the highest margin market. Is that kind of just a wait and see of what the market's going to give you in that time frame? Or do you ultimately see seminal returning back to crude service? If you do want to pursue crude exports in the back half of the decade, I think we're going\u2026.\nJim Teague: I think we go type flexible, Brian, but, I mean, all of the above is possible. If those are full, it's possible we'll just build another one. It's really dependent on SPOT success. And like I said earlier, we're getting a lot more optimistic on being able to get this thing done with good commercialization. We're talking to a lot of people. Brent and I were in Europe, what, three weeks ago, Brent? And our sole purpose was to promote SPOT, and we got some pretty good feedback from people.\nBrian Reynolds: Great, thanks. I'll leave it there. Enjoy the rest of your morning.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi. Your line is open.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. A few cleanup questions for me. Randy going to see if I can try and get you to say lumpy one more time, but just going back to SPOT and thinking about capital allocation next year. I think you mentioned that you'd still be able to sort of maintain this level of distribution growth with the current CapEx program and not come off this sort of buyback plan. But I just want to verify, if SPOT does get sanctioned, CapEx presumably goes higher, and I think you guys lean on the balance sheet maybe for the first time in a while. So, just curious, does all that still hold if SPOT does get sanctioned?\nRandy Fowler: Bob, once we get a license to construct, we're not through, are we?\nRobert Sanders: No, sir. That's just the first of about 2024 that are needed.\nRandy Fowler: It's going to take a while to license to construct. Didn't mean we can go out there and start digging ditches.\nRobert Sanders: No, sir.\nRandy Fowler: Yes, I think, again, with or without SPOT, it doesn't impact 2024. And frankly, I mean, if we're successful with SPOT, most of that's going to be 2025, 2026, 2027, and we're in good shape to continue distribution growth and buybacks during that time period.\nJim Teague: Chris, the one thing I would also add to that is I still think even if we get to a point where SPOT is sanctioned, we'll still be within our three times leverage, plus or minus a quarter of a turn.\nSpiro Dounis: Okay. Got you. Helpful color there. Just going to M&A from two different perspectives. So, one, I guess on the upstream side, we've seen a lot of your customer base continue to consolidate. So, I guess I'm curious to skip your updated views on the potential impact to EPD into midstream more broadly. And then as we think about M&A for EPD, just given the slate of growth projects in front of you, I imagine you're sort of out of that market for the time being, but don't want to put words in your mouth.\nJim Teague: I like what Randy says price matters. The right deal, the right price. I'm not sure we'd back away from it, but it's got to be the right deal at the right price that fits us strategically.\nSpiro Dounis: All right, I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Mckay with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJohn Mckay: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. I wanted to pick up on something that I think Chris mentioned earlier in the call. Just in terms of we're looking at all these new Permian growth projects on the NGL side. How much of the flow do you think is going to come from your own plants on the EPD side versus third party flows? And if we're thinking about that overall, how do you think your market share trends on NGL pipeline throughput over the next couple of years?\nJim Teague: Justin, you got any idea?\nJustin Kleiderer: I think going back to some of the previous commentary, I mean, our G&P asset base is what the feeder to our NGL pipes will continue to be and will continue growing and on a percentage basis, don't have the exact percent, but I'd bet it's 80% plus Fed from our own G&P. And I would expect that's going to continue to grow as we continue to grow that footprint.\nJohn Mckay: That's fair. I appreciate it. Maybe just shifting gears quickly, have the commentary on the PDH 2 ramp in there. Just if you give us an update now that we're a little bit into the fourth quarter and what we should look for there?\nJim Teague: We did have some operational issues in the third quarter with the PDH. We're working some issues with a reactor with the licenser. We should have that resolved later this month and expect this to be a one off and returning to full operation later in November.\nJohn Mckay: I appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nOperator: I'm sorry.\nMichael Blum: No worries. Thanks. So, a lot of questions, obviously, today on the projects and on supply, but wonder if you can give us an update on what you're seeing on the demand side, particularly in China and India, and how any Panama Canal issues are impacting your exports. And then the second part of that question is really the same question, but longer term, you're obviously very bullish on U.S. supply here for a long time. Where do you see all these products being consumed? Do you see that shifting at all from the current setup? Thanks.\nJim Teague: I'll start and I'll probably ask Brent a question. As I said in our script, Michael, it's been a pleasant surprise at the appetite for ethane and that's not in Europe, that's in Asia. And we've got a couple more contracts that I expect that we will sign. So I thought ethane was going to be just a point to point project and I wanted to build the first one, but I didn't really expect it. It looks to me like it's becoming, Brent, much more a traded product?\nBrent Secrest: More so\u2026\nMichael Blum: Than I expected. And then, Brent, speak to the type of demand we see on LPG.\nBrent Secrest: Yes, Michael, if you just look at in the third quarter where the LPG cargoes went, 55% went to Asia, 18% went to the Americas, 17% Europe and 9% Africa. If you were to go trend that and look at the incremental molecule, where it's going, Asia is far and away the leader of where each molecule goes. On the demand side of what that LPG is used for, about one-third is used for petchem use, two-thirds is used for call it human needs cooking and heating. Tony gave us some numbers. I want to say it was yesterday. I'm going to try to look at these notes, but about IEA came out and said 1.5 billion people use LPGs for cooking and heating. If you look at the estimates through 2030, there's about 2 billion people who don't have access to it. If you look at the same consumption per capita those billion people would need about 3 million barrels of LPG between now and 2030. And if you look at Tony's forecast, he's a little shy of 600,000 barrels of LPG from the U.S. through 2030. So the Middle East will make up some of that. But at some point, the U.S. producer is going to have to step up and fill that void.\nJim Teague: Hey, Chris, what was that organization that said propane and natural gas was transitional?\nChris D\u2019Anna: Yes, Jim. MSCI recently came out and upgraded Enterprise to an A rating for their ESG score. And I think that really is a result of the stats that branches throughout. Again, if you think about what LPGs do in improving the quality of life for people in, call it the Southern Hemisphere, that is an absolute game changer. And needing 3 million barrels a day of an additional LPGs between now and the end of the decade is really the reason why MSCI came out and said, okay, LPGs are now a green fuel, if you will.\nJim Teague: I'd like to add relative to solar. And let's think about Africa. Okay? It's going to happen. They're going to use it. But solar, no matter how you think about it, is not a good choice to cook and eat homes with. It simply is not. And people in Africa, they're going to get more. And natural gas and electricity are very expensive to move around. That's what we've seen over the last ten or twelve years with LPG. Get a lot of energy, not hard to move around. It's not hard math.\nChris D\u2019Anna: You just fill up a little tank.\nJim Teague: Yes, sir. Absolutely.\nBrent Secrest: I go back to paraphrase Daniel Juergen, this world has never done energy transition, it has only done energy addition. And I think we're going to see more of that.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thank you for all the color. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. I had a question on the quarter and then a follow up on the NGL pipe. So on the quarter, just NGL marketing has been softer this year than last year. Any drivers you'd highlight? And the frac margin too. You had a huge step up in volumes with the new frac, but the per unit margin was down a lot. Anything you'd call out there?\nJim Teague: You want to talk to frac? Zach?\nRandy Fowler: I'll start with the frac. So this quarter we had two turnarounds on two of our fracs, so that increased our cost. Obviously there, there is some uplift that we get from blend margins, which were down year-over-year and then ERCOT pricing. So just the hot summer hit us this year relative to last year.\nBrent Secrest: NGL marketing. Keith? I think most of it just has to do with structure in the market on a storage. So if you look back when COVID happened, we put on obviously a lot of contango. Some of that was extended further along, dated. And then we had some backwardation opportunities last year that, frankly, we just didn't see those opportunities this year. It's been less volatile in general this year. There just really hasn't been a lot of spreads.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. That's helpful. And then sorry, I have one on the NGL pipe. So just want to confirm. It's a brand new pipe. So it's a greenfield new build. And if there's any way to give more color on what you see as the disadvantages of some of the other alternatives, like a cheaper looping of Shin Oak or even leveraging some of the third party capacity that's getting added just because it's a lot of capacity, I think that the market's seeing getting added all at one time.\nJim Teague: We looked at partial loops, and we didn't think that served what we needed. We decided to just build the entire pipe. And I'll remind you what was Chaparral's capacity 130,000 barrels a day. Then 130,000 barrels a day. We've got to move on other pipe. We get Shin Oak, you're around 600,000 barrels a day right now.\nBrent Secrest: 600.\nJim Teague: And we need Seminole. And frankly, we don't leverage third party pipes we put it in our own.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nRandy Burkhalter: This is randy. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with the Bank of America. Your line is open.\nNeel Mitra: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question about the conversion and where you'll be offloading some of the crude volumes. So from what I understand, Midland -to-ECHO 2 is moving some volumes, and the whole Midland-to-ECHO system is relatively full. So when you move this to NGL service, where do the crude barrels go?\nJim Teague: Midland-to-ECHO 1. And we can get that up to 600,000 barrels a day. There's a marginal difference in cost, but more than made up for what we do with Seminole and NGL service.\nNeel Mitra: Okay, perfect. And then, not to beat a dead horse, but the 700,000 barrel per day crude oil increase in 2023. Just wondering, Tony, from your perspective, for 2Q and 3Q, it seemed like we had flat hydrocarbon growth in general out of the Permian, just with all the infrastructure constraints and the heat compression, et cetera. So are you expecting a big kind of September through December ramp? Because it seems like most of the growth that's come year-to-date has been the first quarter, if I'm not mistaken.\nTony Chovanec: Yeah. I will tell you, it's very hard to count production quarter-by-quarter. What people are looking at is the EIA numbers, which by their own admission, have been very erratic, sporadic, both of the above. But through the second quarter and through the third quarter, if you sat in our management meeting every Tuesday morning, you would hear about the amount of rich gas that wants to come to our plants and can't wait till our plants get built. So we really didn't see a massive lull. I understand that that's what the EIA reported. The facts are the other thing people worried about is the rig drop because the rigs kept dropping. But you have to remember that we had a tremendous build in rigs in 2022 to just make up for what happened during COVID Couldn't stay like that at those levels forever. You had to replenish inventories and you did. So it's very hard to look and say per quarter, but look, we're on a path to exceed 600, and I don't know what takes us from that path off of that path next year, end of story. Well one quarter have freeze offs and one be hotter than the other? Yes, sir. But it doesn't matter. The calculus is so big because, as Jim's pointing out, the basin is so large. There you have it.\nNeel Mitra: Right? Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Randy for closing remarks.\nRandy Fowler: Thank you. Tawanda, we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. That concludes our call. A replay of the call is available through our website via the webcast. And again, have a good day, and I'll turn it back to you for any closing comments Towanda.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

So look, when we look at our production forecast, the EIA actuals for what those words are worth are supposed to be out today or tomorrow. But if we go through what they have for actuals just through July, they're showing 853,000 barrels of growth in crude oil production for this year so far. Now they've been a very, their data is very hard to set your watch to admittedly, but we had talked about 1.8 million barrels over a three-year period, 2022 through 2025 okay, and then people said well, and you know how do you gauge it year-to-year? And I said well, it's hard to tell, but just divide it evenly. I'll definitely take the overall 600 for 2023 without a doubt for crude oil additions. I'll start out when we did our forecast, we projected what activity was going to be. So Permian rig counts, we said, would range between 315 and 320, and they've ranged between 300 and 325, so not hard math there. For frac cruise, we estimated between 135 and 150, and they're between 145 and 160. It's producers' behavior. And look, they're our customers. We talk to them. We plan projects and capital hand in hand with them. So we have a significant amount of what I'd call institutional knowledge. That's a great question. We do not put a coefficient in there for growing efficiencies, and they've been growing for 10 years. I don't know what stops them at this point. But, Jim, to your point, there are about 80 producers that have rigs working in the Permian basin today out of those 80, only 20 of them have five or greater rigs running. Okay? There is significant upside as far as that 60 producers that have less than five rigs running. There's a lot of metrics you can look at, but that's a simple one. That's the reality. No, sir, it did not. It assumes historical recoveries, which are in the high single digits, Randy. Now, we all know that at least two majors have said that that is not how they are forecasting going forward. Yeah. I will tell you, it's very hard to count production quarter-by-quarter. What people are looking at is the EIA numbers, which by their own admission, have been very erratic, sporadic, both of the above. But through the second quarter and through the third quarter, if you sat in our management meeting every Tuesday morning, you would hear about the amount of rich gas that wants to come to our plants and can't wait till our plants get built.

            "name": "Jim Teague",
            "content": "Okay, thank you, Randy. This morning we reported solid results for the third quarter including adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 billion. We had 1.7 times coverage of our distributable cash flow and we retained $773 million. But we had challenges throughout the quarter. Record heat in August and September affected our processing plants throughput and refrigeration at our NGL export facilities and we experienced operational challenges at our PDH plants. We were also challenged by low natural gas and NGL prices, but despite these challenges, we handle record volumes across our midstream system, including our liquids pipelines, natural gas pipelines, NGL fractionators and our marine terminals. In total, our pipelines transported 12.2 million barrels per day of crude oil equivalent. In terms of hydrocarbon exports, we reported 2.1 million barrels a day and while most people focus on crude exports, we focused on hydrocarbon exports. We exported everything from ethylene to crude oil. I think both Randy and I are very optimistic that our folks can do even more with the assets we have. Among some of the highlights so far this year is an unbelievable growing appetite for ethane exports and of course we're expanding our export facility and this demand seems like it's comes from all parts of the world. We're also continuing to see a growing appetite for LPG exports and we're having productive negotiations in anticipation of getting our SPOT license to construct permits soon. Our fundamentals group forecasts have been consistently on the money in the past. We have a lot of confidence in their future outlook. Therefore, this morning we announced an expansion of our NGL franchise. We're going to build two more 300 million cubic feet today processing plants in the Permian, one in the Delaware and one in Midland. When completed, we'll have 19 processing trains in the Permian and 41 company-wide. Today, we also announced that we are converting our 210,000 barrel per day Seminole crude oil pipeline back to NGL service to support our needed Permian NGL take away. In addition, we announced our Bahia 30-inch NGL pipeline that will originate in the Permian and deliver up to 600,000 barrels a day of NGL into our storage system in Chambers County. The beauty of this Seminole pipeline is we can seamlessly switch service between crude, our NGLs are as an expansion of our new TW refined product system. Yes Jeremy, I think we've demonstrated as far as coming in and consistently, and I'd like to say we balanced the buybacks with continuing to invest in the partnership and grow cash flows per unit. And to me the cash flow per unit growth is the main metric there and leverage. And keeping leverage in check are the -- is really the main metric because the more cash flow per unit you grow eventually this is going to translate into free cash flow, because again, I think our growth CapEx is lumpy over time. We, in 2024 we said we were going to be back in the range of 3 to 3.5 times and some of that is, we have a number of projects. I keep hating to use the word lumpy, but we have some material projects out there whether it's our [indiscernible] river, export our ethane and propane export facility or whether it's the Bahia pipeline that are fairly large projects. Once you get past those, the natural gas processing plants, NGL fractionators are very manageable growth CapEx. SPOT would be out there, if we cannot go ahead and finish commercializing that, but that's something that's going to be spread out over 3, 3.5 years. So I really see the period where we're investing the $3 billion to $3.5 billion a year is pretty limited and so as a result I think once you get out further call it 2025, 2026, 2027, we ought to be flowing off a good bit of free cash flow as you say. Right now, we don't see the need to come in and reduce leverage anymore from where we are today with the target of 3.3 times. So again, that provides more cash for distribution growth and buybacks. You understand what you're talking about the 30-inch Bahia? We felt like that was the right size given what we see. What a lot of people, what I had Tony look into at sometimes is a damn Permian is how about 10 stack pays? Huh? I mean and then I look at what somebody like Exxon CEO said about getting more efficient and getting better recoveries and I think we're just scratching the surface and I think we'll -- one thing Jim Teague hates and Randy Fowler hates are empty assets and they won't stay empty for long. That was more of an answer than you wanted, wasn't it? Hi, Tristan, this is Jim. Yes, we keep hearing that. We, I personally think and we made a mistake and maybe it was I made a mistake when we were the only game in town in that we went after pretty high fees when I wish we'd have gone after lower fees because we opened the door for competition. That won't happen again. I don't know how a Greenfield project competes with the brownfield project, especially when you have someone like Enterprise that's going to be damn aggressive in holding market share or even growing it. 9.3 was never intended to be guidance, although every one of you guys took it as such. It was a goal. It was a goal. And I can't remember the last time we missed meeting ago. Going to be very tight, Jean Ann. With organic, you can build plants where you want them. And you don't have to deal with some acquiring a company that has a hell of a lot of dedications to other companies. So, we just \u2013 we can build them where we want them and we control the liquids. Tony, let me ask, when your forecast, did you all build in any growing efficiencies? Or did you no... So [indiscernible] and all that would be using a Louisiana term, lan-yap, a little something extra, Brian. I think we go type flexible, Brian, but, I mean, all of the above is possible. If those are full, it's possible we'll just build another one. It's really dependent on SPOT success. And like I said earlier, we're getting a lot more optimistic on being able to get this thing done with good commercialization. We're talking to a lot of people. Brent and I were in Europe, what, three weeks ago, Brent? And our sole purpose was to promote SPOT, and we got some pretty good feedback from people. Chris, the one thing I would also add to that is I still think even if we get to a point where SPOT is sanctioned, we'll still be within our three times leverage, plus or minus a quarter of a turn. I like what Randy says price matters. The right deal, the right price. I'm not sure we'd back away from it, but it's got to be the right deal at the right price that fits us strategically. Justin, you got any idea? We did have some operational issues in the third quarter with the PDH. We're working some issues with a reactor with the licenser. We should have that resolved later this month and expect this to be a one off and returning to full operation later in November. I'll start and I'll probably ask Brent a question. As I said in our script, Michael, it's been a pleasant surprise at the appetite for ethane and that's not in Europe, that's in Asia. And we've got a couple more contracts that I expect that we will sign. So I thought ethane was going to be just a point to point project and I wanted to build the first one, but I didn't really expect it. It looks to me like it's becoming, Brent, much more a traded product? Hey, Chris, what was that organization that said propane and natural gas was transitional? I'd like to add relative to solar. And let's think about Africa. Okay? It's going to happen. They're going to use it. But solar, no matter how you think about it, is not a good choice to cook and eat homes with. It simply is not. And people in Africa, they're going to get more. And natural gas and electricity are very expensive to move around. That's what we've seen over the last ten or twelve years with LPG. Get a lot of energy, not hard to move around. It's not hard math. Yes, sir. Absolutely. You want to talk to frac? Zach? We looked at partial loops, and we didn't think that served what we needed. We decided to just build the entire pipe. And I'll remind you what was Chaparral's capacity 130,000 barrels a day. Then 130,000 barrels a day. We've got to move on other pipe. We get Shin Oak, you're around 600,000 barrels a day right now. And we need Seminole. And frankly, we don't leverage third party pipes we put it in our own. Midland-to-ECHO 1. And we can get that up to 600,000 barrels a day. There's a marginal difference in cost, but more than made up for what we do with Seminole and NGL service."

            "name": "Randy Fowler",
            "content": "Okay, thank you and good morning everyone. Starting with the income statement items, net income attributable to common unit holders for the third quarter of 2023 was $1.3 billion or $0.60 per common unit on a fully diluted basis, compared to $1.4 billion or $0.62 per common unit on a fully diluted basis for the third quarter of last year. Adjusted cash flow from operations or which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital was $2 billion for the third quarters of both 2023 and 2022. We declared a distribution of $0.50 per common unit for the third quarter of 2023, which is a 5.3% increase over the distribution declared for the third quarter of 2022. The distribution will be paid November 14 to common unitholders of record as of close of business today. This year marks our 25th consecutive year of distribution growth. I guess you can say you can treat that distribution as a treat today. Our dividend reinvestment plan and enterprise unit -- employee unit purchase plan purchased approximately 1.4 million common units on the open market for a total purchase price of approximately $37 million during the third quarter of 2023. Our utilization of the authorized $2 billion buyback program is unchanged at 41% with unit purchases for the first nine months of the year totaling approximately 3.6 million common units for a total purchase price of approximately $92 million. For the 12 months ending September 30, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.3 billion in distributions to limited partners. These distributions combined with $213 million in buybacks for the last 12 months result in Enterprise having a payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations of 56% and a payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow of 90% for that 12-month period. Our buyback activity has been admittedly lumpy over the last 18 months. EPD elected not to buy back equity in the third quarter. During the third quarter buyback window our fee WAP, our volume weighted average price was 98% of our 52-week unit price and we elected to be patient. We fully expect to be back in the market doing buybacks in the fourth quarter. We have established a track record of opportunistic buybacks over the last six years. We will continue to look for opportunistic windows to reduce unit count as we remain focused on improving our cash flow per unit metrics. We recently did a comparison of the six largest North American midstream energy companies, those with a market capitalization over $35 billion. Since 2019, EPD is one of only two companies to have actually reduced common unit/share count and we are the only midstream company to reduce unit count over this time period without material asset sales. EPD reduced its common unit count by approximately 1% over this period, as did our peer. While this is a modest start, it is a consistent start of buybacks for six years in a row. We were also one of only three companies that grew distributable cash flow per unit by 15% or more, in fact, for this group of six midstream energy companies, DPD is the only company to have both reduced unit count and increased DCF per unit. We will include this peer comparison of DCF per unit growth, change in unit count and change in debt in our upcoming investor slide deck after our peers file their third quarter 10-Qs. We believe this will show EPDs balanced approach to increasing the value of the partnership for our limited partners over time. Total capital investments in the third quarter of this year were $826 million which included $722 million for growth projects and $99 million of sustaining cap. Capital investments for the first nine months of 2023 were $2.3 billion, which includes $2 billion organic growth capital projects and $284 million for sustaining capital expenditures. We expect our 2023 growth capital expenditures to total $3 billion. We expect 2023 sustaining capital expenditures will be approximately $400 million. As Jim mentioned earlier, this morning, we also announced $3.1 billion of organic growth projects to expand our core NGL franchise in the most prolific basin in North America. These projects will provide additional natural gas processing and NGL pipeline and fractionation capacity to support continued production growth out of the Permian Basin. These growth projects will also bring additional volumes to our downstream NGL storage, pipeline and marine terminal assets. In addition, facilitating Permian production growth also provides indirect business opportunities for our crude oil and natural gas businesses. With the addition of these four projects, we have $6.8 billion of major growth capital expenditures of projects under construction. We are currently forecasting 2024 growth capital expenditures in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. We do not expect this level of capital investment to impact our distribution growth or our buyback activity in 2024. For 2024, we expect our buyback activity to be consistent with our history of approximately $200 million to $250 million a year. We are confident the returns generated by these organic capital investments in the heart of our NGL value chain will support the continued growth in EPD's cash flow per unit and free cash flow, which will support future returns of capital through both distribution growth and buybacks. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $29.2 billion as of September 30, 2023. Assuming the final maturity date for our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio is approximately 19 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.6%. At September 30, approximately 96% of our debt was fixed rate. In 2024 only $850 million or approximately 3% of our $28.6 billion in term debt obligations which excludes commercial paper actually mature. For the three years 2024 through 2026, only 13% of our term debt obligations mature. The combination of this modest maturity ladder, the average life of our debt portfolio and high percentage of fixed rate debt provide the partnership with ample financial flexibility and provides a solid foundation to grow cash flow per unit. In other words, incremental cash generated from these new projects will not be materially eroded by having to refinance our existing debt portfolio in the current high interest rate environment and thus will better translate into cash flow per unit growth. I do not believe the value of our debt portfolio and liability management is fully appreciated. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter and this includes availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash on hand. Our adjusted EBITDA was $9.2 billion for the trailing 12 months ending September 30, 2023 compared to $9 billion for the trailing 12 months ending September 30, 2022. We ended the quarter with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0 times on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and reduced by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand. Our leverage target remains 3 times plus or minus 0.25, so the range of 2.75 to 3.25 times. With that Randy, we can open it up for questions. I guess what changed is the opportunities were there, Theresa and we thought like it is the right time to go. I know there's a lot of questions in the past on Chinook and as we look at what we're doing out in the Permian, we felt like we needed to move on Chinook given that we're going to build two more plants and bringing our plants out there to 19, which is quite a lot of WAG, right? Chris? And as evidence to that Theresa, we took Seminole's crude service because we need NGL take away right now until the Bahia pipeline gets in service. So Frac #14 will be full and those two processing plants when we bring them on will be full, right Natalie? Yes, we're going to, we're having some productive negotiations with producers and large trading houses on SPOT and frankly I'm getting more optimistic by the day. We have that record of decision. We're still waiting on Bob Sanders, the license to construct which we're hoping that we expect to have by the end of the year. You got anything, Brent? And on to the question on more LPG out of the ship channel, I think everybody knows how much I love the Houston Ship Channel. And the neat thing about the ship, the ship channel is you have two-way traffic. From what I understand daylight restrictions will be lifted November 1st, but then when they widen it that's even -- we can get a lot more traffic coming down that channel, Bob? Good morning. Yes. And Jeremy I what I'd add also and I thought the timing was good. Rusted Brazil a note that also highlighted end of last week, end of last week, Tony, you want to hit some of the... And I guess, Tony, also the forecast that your team worked on did not assume a higher recovery of reserves. Bob, once we get a license to construct, we're not through, are we? It's going to take a while to license to construct. Didn't mean we can go out there and start digging ditches. Yes, I think, again, with or without SPOT, it doesn't impact 2024. And frankly, I mean, if we're successful with SPOT, most of that's going to be 2025, 2026, 2027, and we're in good shape to continue distribution growth and buybacks during that time period. I'll start with the frac. So this quarter we had two turnarounds on two of our fracs, so that increased our cost. Obviously there, there is some uplift that we get from blend margins, which were down year-over-year and then ERCOT pricing. So just the hot summer hit us this year relative to last year. Thank you. Tawanda, we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. That concludes our call. A replay of the call is available through our website via the webcast. And again, have a good day, and I'll turn it back to you for any closing comments Towanda."

I think Tony Chovanec and his group need to take a victory lap for their ability to forecast production and SPOT is going to be about what the Permian Basin does from crude oil and all things and that's what all these projects align toward. More so... Yes, Michael, if you just look at in the third quarter where the LPG cargoes went, 55% went to Asia, 18% went to the Americas, 17% Europe and 9% Africa. If you were to go trend that and look at the incremental molecule, where it's going, Asia is far and away the leader of where each molecule goes. On the demand side of what that LPG is used for, about one-third is used for petchem use, two-thirds is used for call it human needs cooking and heating. Tony gave us some numbers. I want to say it was yesterday. I'm going to try to look at these notes, but about IEA came out and said 1.5 billion people use LPGs for cooking and heating. If you look at the estimates through 2030, there's about 2 billion people who don't have access to it. If you look at the same consumption per capita those billion people would need about 3 million barrels of LPG between now and 2030. And if you look at Tony's forecast, he's a little shy of 600,000 barrels of LPG from the U.S. through 2030. So the Middle East will make up some of that. But at some point, the U.S. producer is going to have to step up and fill that void. I go back to paraphrase Daniel Juergen, this world has never done energy transition, it has only done energy addition. And I think we're going to see more of that. NGL marketing. Keith? I think most of it just has to do with structure in the market on a storage. So if you look back when COVID happened, we put on obviously a lot of contango. Some of that was extended further along, dated. And then we had some backwardation opportunities last year that, frankly, we just didn't see those opportunities this year. It's been less volatile in general this year. There just really hasn't been a lot of spreads. 600."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Randy Burkhalter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Norma and good morning everyone and welcome to the Enterprise Products conference call today to discuss second quarter earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise\u2019s general partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise\u2019s management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that those \u2013 that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements that made during the call today. And so, with that, I will turn it over to Jim.\nJim Teague: Thank you, Randy. Today, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 billion for the second quarter of \u201823 compared to $2.4 billion for the second quarter of \u201822 and $2.3 billion for the first quarter of \u201823. We generated $1.7 billion of DCF, providing 1.6x coverage. Enterprise retained $639 million of DCF in the second quarter, and we\u2019ve retained $1.5 billion year-to-date. We had resilient financial results despite the impact of lower prices for crude and natural gas, NGLs, and petrochemicals. Our profits were negatively impacted by weaker processing margins for the first part of the year. Our petrochemical service segment continued to perform in spite of the low price and lower margin environment. During the quarter, we established six operational records, including our natural gas pipeline volumes, NGL fractionation volumes and 11.9 million barrels of oil equivalent of total pipeline volumes. We are also extremely proud of the fact that with the increase in our distribution last quarter, we crossed the threshold of 25 consecutive years of distribution growth, literally unheard of in the midstream industry. This is truly exceptional milestone across all industries and, most importantly, a real tribute to the core principles laid out from our very beginnings that Randa continues to prioritize today. Moving to growth capital, we started the second quarter with $6.1 billion in major growth projects under construction. We have since completed construction on four major growth projects that will provide new sources of cash. We have an additional $4.1 billion under construction. Completed major projects during the second quarter and early July include a 400 million cubic foot a day expansion of the Haynesville Extension of the Acadian natural gas pipeline system, which has sold out; our Poseidon cryogenic natural gas processing plant, which was our sixth processing plant in the Midland Basin, which is sold out; our 19th NGL fractionator, which is sold out; and our PDH 2 plant in Chambers County, which is sold out and ramping up currently between 65% and 70% and climbing. The three main \u2013 remaining natural gas processing plants we have under construction in the Permian Basin will go into service in late \u201823 and early \u201824, one in Midland and one in Delaware, and the first phase of the Texas Western products pipeline will be put into service in December. When we complete the next three Permian plants, we\u2019ll have 16 processing plants in the Permian, with a capability to process 3.8 Bcf a day of natural gas and extract more than 520,000 barrels a day of NGLs, all destined for additional value-added services in our Gulf Coast NGL systems. Meanwhile, downstream of the Permian, we have major expansions underway for ethane, ethylene, polymer-grade propane, propylene, and LPG, expanding and upgrading our export capacity at the Ship Channel at Morgan\u2019s Point and at Beaumont. Our new export projects are designed with an emphasis on flexibility and reliability, centered around a highly integrated footprint, with multi-product capabilities even as the world works its way through a significant petrochemical downturn, U.S. NGLs and olefins continue to get a lot of attention from petrochemicals focused on feedstock diversity and advantaged prices. In addition to multiple long-term export contracts we recently signed, we are also in discussions with counterparties from several countries for substantial amounts of additional natural gas liquids and olefin exports. This level of customer interest is what supports further expansion of our export capabilities. A wide gas-to-crude spread gives the petrochemical industry a feedstock advantage that is proving both durable and permanent. As Randy heard me say a million times, I grew up in that business and I\u2019ve lived through more than a few cycles. Only the strong prospered through times like these, and U.S. NGL feedstocks sourced from shale, oil, and gas are again proving their growing importance. The durability of U.S. shales is evident in ever-increasing U.S. exports of crude, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and in exports of petrochemicals in various forms. In July, Enterprise crude oil exports will exceed a record 30 million barrels. Oil and gas has faced commodity price headwinds, especially compared to the premiums of last year when crude averaged over $100 a barrel during the first 6 months of 2022. We see no reason that crude should have been trading at the low levels of the last few months. In early June, OPEC+ announced they were extending their reductions into 2024. On top of that, the Saudis announced that they would unilaterally cut an additional 1.1 million barrels a day of production in July and August, with the option to extend these cuts as needed. Meanwhile, waterborne data confirms that Russia\u2019s exports are coming down. Inventories of crude and refined products, both in the U.S. and globally, remain very low, while OPEC+ continues to demonstrate they are committed to price stability. Even though industrial demand continues to lag, consumer demand is strong, especially in developed nations. Crude oil supply demand fundamentals continue to indicate that we\u2019re in store for much tighter balances for the remainder of the year and in 2024. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Randy.\nRandy Fowler: Okay. Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Starting with the income statement, net income attributable to common unitholders for the second quarter of 2023 was $1.3 billion or $0.57 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.4 billion or $0.64 per common unit for the second quarter of last year. Adjusted cash flow from operations, or we call it adjusted CFFO, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital, was $1.9 billion for the second quarter of this year, compared to $2.1 billion for the second quarter of 2022. As Jim mentioned, 2023 marks our 25th consecutive year of distribution growth. We declared a distribution of $0.50 per common unit for the second quarter of 2023, which is a 5% \u2013 5.3% increase over the distribution declared for the second quarter of last year and a 2% increase over the distribution that we declared last quarter. This distribution will be paid August 14 to common holders of record as of close of business July 31. In the second quarter, we purchased 2.9 million common units for the quarter at a total cost of $75 million. For the first half of the year, unit purchases totaled approximately 3.6 million common units, for a total purchase price of approximately $92 million. Inclusive of these purchases, we have now utilized 41% of the authorized $2 billion buyback program. In addition, our distribution reinvestment plan and our employee unit purchase plan purchased an approximately 2 million common units on the open market, for a total purchase price of approximately $51 million, and that was also during the second quarter. For the 12 months ending June 30, 2023, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.2 billion in distributions to limited partners. These distributions, combined with $307 million in buybacks for this period, result in Enterprise having a payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations of 57% and a ratio of payout for adjusted free cash flow of 86%. Total capital investments in the second quarter of 2023 were $784 million, which included $683 million for growth capital projects and $101 million of sustaining capital expenditures. As Jim noted, we have $4.1 billion of major growth projects under construction, $1.1 billion of which are expected to begin service in the remainder of 2023. We continue to expect our growth capital expenditures for 2023 will be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion, depending on any incremental system expansions and timing. We continue to expect sustaining capital expenditures for 2023 will be approximately $400 million. Turning to capitalization. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $28.9 billion as of June 30. Assuming the final maturity date for our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio was 20 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.6%. And at June 30, approximately 97% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity at quarter-end was approximately $4 billion, and that includes both availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2023, our adjusted EBITDA was $9.1 billion. This compares to $8.8 billion for the trailing 12 months ending June 30 of 2022. We ended the quarter with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0x on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and reduced by the partnership\u2019s unrestricted cash on hand. As a reminder, our leverage target remains 3x plus or minus 0.25. So, if you would, 2.75x to 3.25x. So, we are right in the middle of that range. And with that, Randy, I think we can open it up for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay. Thank you, Randy. Norma, we\u2019re ready to open it up to questions from our listeners. And I would like to remind our listeners to restrict your questions please to one question and one follow-up question and I\u2019ll take it from \u2013 you can go ahead and take it from here, Norma.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Theresa Chen with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTheresa Chen: Hi. I\u2019d love to get your sense on the third quarter outlook and beyond, just given the recent action we saw in NGL pricing and ethane, in particular. Would you be able to comment on this and will you expect pricing to do as the quarter progresses? And how does this fit with your ability to earn outsized margins along your integrated NGL value chain, as well as potentially cheap the $9.3 billion runway basis?\nJim Teague: Yes. This is Jim. I think we feel pretty constructive on the second half of the year. If we look at our processing margins, Natalie, they are better than they \u2013 they\u2019ve been moving up.\nNatalie Gayden: That\u2019s right.\nJim Teague: Okay. And in terms of outsized spreads, my experience is you can\u2019t predict them, but they\u2019re always there, and I think we might see more opportunity in the second half than we have seen in the first half.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you. And then on the petchem front, can you just comment on what you\u2019re seeing as far as demand goes and the ramp-up of PDH utilization and/or the underutilization on the ethylene production side?\nJim Teague: Chris, you got it? Where\u2019s Chris?\nChris D\u2019Anna: Yes, Theresa. This is Chris D\u2019Anna. On the petchem side overall demand, non-durables, we\u2019re seeing healthy exports, whether it\u2019s in the form of pellets or whether it\u2019s in the form of ethylene across our dock, which remains full. On the durable side, we\u2019ve seen numbers increasing over the last 4 months, but it really hasn\u2019t translated to higher overall demand. So, as we talk to customers, what originally was going to be a strong second half is probably pushed out maybe 6 months or so. And then on the MTBE side, it\u2019s really a business that\u2019s driven by normal RBOB and octane. That remains strong. So, there were \u2013 there was a lot in your question. PDH, it\u2019s ramping up. As it ramps up, we\u2019re sold out all the way up to the maximum nameplate. And so, we will continue to see that perform.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nTristan Richardson: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just curious, Jim, you mentioned discussions with new international customers that, maybe you haven\u2019t had relationships with before in the past. Should we think of these incremental customers as largely around filling export expansions currently underway or would these potential relationships be for further expansion to your export capacity down the road?\nJim Teague: We signed that contract, Tug, yesterday? Okay. You\u2019re about ready to execute it? The one that we\u2019re going to execute, I think, we\u2019ve \u2013 we had one large one. I think it was 200,000 barrels a day that we executed recently. And we\u2019re in discussions with at least two more, Tug? Four more. And our guys are headed to Asia for an extended trip, not too long. So, I guess it\u2019s both, what we built and what we expect to sign.\nTristan Richardson: Okay. Helpful. Thanks, Jim. And then maybe, Randy, just curious, as we\u2019ve now seen PDH come online and Frac 12 commissioned, as well as a processing plant, I know it\u2019s too early to talk about 2024 capital, but just thinking about the potential for this elevated spend for these large and critical projects kind of coming to a conclusion in \u201823 such that \u201824 could be lower than \u201823?\nRandy Fowler: Yes. Tristan, on that, certainly getting PDH 2 completed, that was a big capital project. But when we come in and see the opportunities just in and around our system, I think, frankly, we\u2019re going to be in that $2 billion, $2.5 billion range for the next 2 to 3 years. And some of that, I\u2019ll have to say that $2 billion to $2.5 billion really is still excluding spot, which is still going through the licensing process. But hey, we\u2019re just seeing a lot of good activity, a lot of good growth opportunities across the system.\nTristan Richardson: Appreciate it. Thank you, guys, very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis with Citi. Your line is now open.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Actually, I want to go back to that a little bit if we could, just on capital allocation. So, I guess on my math, I think you still have you guys generating about 10% to 15% of operating cash flow that\u2019s sort of unspoken for over the next few years, even with spot in there as well. So, just curious to get your latest thoughts on preferred ways to allocate that capital given your leverage levels are really already at sector lows.\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Spiro. I think it comes back to, really, what you\u2019ve seen out of us the last 2 or 3 years. It\u2019s sort of all of the above. Certainly, in the last year, year and a half, we\u2019ve picked back up on the cadence of our distribution growth. So, we\u2019re \u2013 and again, that seems like the most direct way to return capital to our partners is through distribution bumps. But, I think we\u2019ll continue to come in and sort of use all of the above.\nSpiro Dounis: Yes. Fair enough. Second question on Shin Oak. And, Jim, I\u2019ll preface this question with I know you\u2019re going to expand Shin Oak at some point, but I also know you\u2019ve talked about short-term bridging solutions to get there. I was just curious if you guys have any updated thoughts on that.\nJim Teague: I got a lot of thoughts on that, Spiro. I was in a 2-hour meeting yesterday with Brent and Justin. So, you can imagine what it\u2019s like spending 2 hours with Brent and Justin looking at all of our options, all of our options. And our options could be we\u2019ll add another line called \u2013 what are we calling that? Bahia. Or we could partially loop Shin Oak and take Seminole out of NGL service. The bottom line is we have to have more takeaway out of the Permian. And, I guess I\u2019ve got to have another 2 or 3 hours with Justin and Brent. We\u2019ll come up with a solution.\nSpiro Dounis: Sounds good. Appreciate the color, guys. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan Securities. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nJim Teague: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to start off with some of the NGL dynamics as you\u2019re talking about before. I think you mentioned how the ethane prices have been volatile as of late. And just wondering if you see that as kind of logistics constraints given heat in Texas or otherwise, and I guess future outlook for ethane and propane prices at this point given the volatility that we\u2019ve seen recently?\nJim Teague: Go ahead, Brent.\nBrent Secrest: So, on ethane, I think what you saw last month is when nominations were due for ethane recoveries, the forward curve probably said not to recover. So, you saw a bunch of ethane get rejected in the Permian Basin. You couple that with some operational issues on various plants across the entire basin, there was probably some frac rates that were lower than normal, and that made ethane very, very tight. I think if you look out forward, I think some of that volatility is going to suppress, and I think we\u2019d get back to probably more of a normal type ratio between ethane and natural gas. But there was a culmination of factors that caused that.\nJim Teague: Hey. Graham, turn on your mic. We always talk \u2013 we worry about plants going down in the winter. What\u2019s 103 \u2013 temperature down?\nGraham Bacon: Certainly, there are some challenges with that, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been a material impact on our operating rates. We\u2019re generally designed for those conditions.\nJim Teague: What about others?\nGraham Bacon: I can\u2019t speak for others.\nJim Teague: Well, I\u2019m trying to get you to.\nBrent Secrest: And then just real quick on propane, when you look at just overall global demand, I think we\u2019ve had four PDH plants come up in China so far this year. There\u2019s 11 other PDH plants scheduled to come online for the balance of this year.\nJim Teague: That\u2019s propane. Is that all in?\nBrent Secrest: I mean, if you say 100% capacity factor, that\u2019s another 250,000 barrels a day. Those plants aren\u2019t running at those higher rates, but call it 65% to 70%. It\u2019ll certainly put another bid under propane just no matter how fast production comes online.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it.\nBrent Secrest: I would hope that we\u2019ve seen the bottom on propane. That\u2019s my hope.\nJim Teague: If not, it will still price to export, right?\nBrent Secrest: That\u2019s right.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just as we look going forward here, we keep seeing Enterprise\u2019s leverage dipping down below three. And just wondering if that trend continues, what should we expect at that point? Leverage just continues to decline or I think $2 billion to $2.5 billion of CapEx next year, could that increase, or just any other thoughts, in general, on capital allocation?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Jeremy. Again, we\u2019re sort of in the middle of our range at 3.0x. And I think, again, the team is really bringing in some good commercial opportunities. We think growth CapEx would be $2 billion, $2.5 billion. And again, as I mentioned earlier, that is without spot. And so, I think we would just like to see it develop. As far as returning capital, we \u2013 I said we picked up the pace on distribution growth. Still doing some buybacks. Balance sheet is in great shape. And, Jeremy, I guess just staying in a position that \u2013 a lot of opportunities come along, and we just want to be in a good position to execute on them.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi. Good morning. Has the scope changed a bit for the Beaumont export terminal? It looks like from the slides you\u2019re adding propane exports there.\nJim Teague: You\u2019re pretty observant, Jean Ann. Go ahead, Tug.\nTug Hanley: Alright. So, yes, the scope has changed on that. We previously announced 120,000 barrels a day ethane train at Beaumont. And now, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re proceeding with that train, in addition to a 180,000 barrels a day ethane train that can also do up to 360,000 barrels a day of propane. So, we\u2019re not adding any additional ethane-only capacity, rather what we like to call flex capacity. We\u2019re doing that in lieu of our Ref 4 expansion, and we\u2019re opting for a much smaller capital project at our Ship Channel facility to increase our butane loading rates and allow for fully refrigerated PGP.\nJim Teague: So, Jean Ann, in our \u2013 in my script, I said multiproduct and flexibility, and that\u2019s what \u2013 so Tug can go to somebody and say, look, you can take three tanks of ethane and a tank of ethylene or you can take three tanks of ethane and a tank of propane, so \u2013 or vice versa. So, we\u2019re trying to get \u2013 fix it where those things will always be full, but not necessarily of the same product.\nTug Hanley: Butane, propylene, ethane, ethylene, you name it.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Interesting. Thank you. And then is the Acadian expansion running full already? And maybe more broadly, in your opinion, is Haynesville just completely full-on gas takeaway now until as new pipes come on?\nNatalie Gayden: Hey, Jean Ann. This is Natalie. Haynesville, for us, Acadian extension is full. Gas continues to produce in the \u2013 even on our gathering systems, we\u2019re getting more and more gas every day.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great. Thanks. That\u2019s all for me.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colton Bean with TPH and Company. Your line is now open.\nColton Bean: Good morning. So, just shifting back to the backlog, on the expected \u201824 growth capital range, Randy, I think you outlined that $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Currently improved projects look to be closer to 1.4. So, can you just characterize the type of projects that you\u2019re expecting to reach FID on and the hurdles you would need to clear to move those projects into the official backlog?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Colton. Brent, do you want to take some of this because you are on the front line of it?\nBrent Secrest: Yes. I mean, just to generalize this, Colton, I think everything\u2019s going to be centered around the Permian Basin. So, whether that\u2019s an NGL pipe solution, whether that\u2019s processing plants, or whether that\u2019s an additional fractionator, it\u2019s going to be all centered around Permian production growth.\nColton Bean: Got it. So, effectively, all kind of NGL supply chain. Makes sense. And then on the operations side, it looks like Midland processing earnings were relatively flat Q on Q despite the lower NGL pricing. So, have we effectively reached fee floors for the acquired system at this point?\nRandy Fowler: Yes.\nColton Bean: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Good morning. Wanted to start on spot, just any update on commercial momentum and remaining permitting process, and how soon you could conceivably get to an FID on that project?\nJim Teague: We \u2013 I think we should have our license to construct, Graham, in September, October?\nGraham Bacon: Yes, that\u2019s where it\u2019s trending right now. Everything\u2019s going well right now in the licensing stage, and we\u2019re expecting in the next \u2013 within the next few months.\nJim Teague: In terms of \u2013 I mean, we\u2019re traveling the world on spot where we have a laser focus on getting customers on spot, and I think we will, and I believe we\u2019ll end up building it.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. And that could be by next year even to be starting construction on that, do you think?\nJim Teague: Well, if Tug and Brent would get off their rear end and get to Asia and see everybody, we would probably \u2013 it would probably be sooner rather than later. But we are going to commercialize this thing. And we have got meetings. Brent and I are going to Europe later this month, Brent?\nBrent Secrest: September.\nJim Teague: In September. And the focus is on spot. We are pulling out all things to get it done.\nKeith Stanley: Okay. Thanks for that. And the second question just on the year overall, so the project $9.3 billion target for EBITDA, you did $4.5 billion in the first half. But as you pointed out a lot, you have a lot of major projects starting up, commodities are improving. Just any updated thoughts on how you are feeling on that target, things that need to go right, areas where you may have cushion, etcetera.\nJim Teague: I say this every time, that\u2019s not guidance, but it\u2019s a goal, and we reward all of our employees once if we hit that goal. And somebody asked on one earnings call, have we ever had a goal that we didn\u2019t meet, we are bound and determined that our employees are going to be rewarded by meeting $9.3 billion goal. What\u2019s going to help us, I think is if you talk to Tony. I mean crude prices, I don\u2019t know what they are doing today, Tony, but they have been up $10 in the last, what\u2026?\nTony Chovanec: 30 days.\nJim Teague: 30 days. The balances are tight. All of our plants are full. The key \u2013 and Graham knows this. I think the key is to keep the plants running because we will capitalize on any volatility.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrian Reynolds: Hi. Good morning everyone. Just talk on the crude business. It seems to be finding its footing in terms of margin opportunity for the first time since COVID. So, curious if you could just opine on whether you are seeing incremental barrels and opportunity come back to Houston as Corpus remains full and if we continue to see green shoots into the back half of \u201823. Thanks.\nJim Teague: I think in my script, what I have said is we set a record for loading crude onto ships in the month of\u2026\nTony Chovanec: July.\nJim Teague: July. Thank you, Tony. And yes, Brent, I think you are seeing barrels move only towards Houston.\nBrent Secrest: Yes. I mean, I think\u2026\nJim Teague: And Brent before you answer that, but also talk about our quality improvements across the system.\nBrent Secrest: I think fundamentally, we believe in Tony\u2019s production numbers as we go forward. We do think that the Corpus pipelines are full. We think that we have done \u2013 what we have done on our system as it relates to quality has brought more interest. And I do think when we speak to our customers, they want a bigger and bigger position in Houston. So, I think over time \u2013 and the other piece on this is not all pipelines are created equal. There is other pipelines that go to Houston or go to Beaumont that are more challenged than our integrated crude pipelines. So, I think we are going to be the beneficiary of these volumes going forward.\nJim Teague: HOU.\nBrent Secrest: HOU helps.\nJim Teague: And Brent.\nBrent Secrest: Yes. I mean just the HOU being able to deliver and data Brent, and what we have done on our system, you are seeing the open interest on that contract continue to go up. We have sent records in the last couple of weeks on daily traded volume. I think ICE had a press release recently and went through some of those details. But all of this just put together lends itself to more interest in trying to get to Houston on our pipelines.\nJim Teague: I am not supposed to ask questions, but I will anyway. Where is Jay? How many of your cargoes have met dated Brent specs?\nBrent Secrest: Since we implemented the new quality specification mimicking the plot spec, we have met \u2013 every one of our export cargoes have met that specification since we adopted it in May.\nBrian Reynolds: Great. Thanks for all the color. And maybe to just touch a little bit on M&A, commentary coming out of the Analyst Day, it seemed like it was coming or attractive for Enterprise. But with nothing year-to-date and EPD continuing to maintain its high bar for returns, just kind of curious if you could just give us a forward-looking update on potential M&A appetite or whether other uses of capital could impact the use of M&A going forward? Thanks.\nJim Teague: One of the things about building plants is you could build them where you want them, and that\u2019s what I love about building all these plants in the Permian, and we are probably not through, and building the fractionator where you want it. So, that\u2019s my color. But Randy is the one you should ask.\nRandy Fowler: Yes. It makes me want to go back and reread our transcripts from the Analyst Day. I didn\u2019t know we were that bullish on M&A. But yes, again, we will take a look at opportunities that come up. We are on every banker\u2019s rolodex [ph]. So, we get an opportunity to take a look and \u2013 but I can\u2019t say that we are predisposed to come in and jump on M&A if it makes sense, good return on capital, and if it fits the system, dovetails in, I think that\u2019s one discipline that we have had over the years. It\u2019s not building a collection of assets, but coming in and actually ties in and bolts onto our system and provides downstream or upstream opportunities. We will continue to look at that.\nBrian Reynolds: All make sense. I appreciate the color. Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMichael Blum: Thank you. Hi. Good morning everyone. I wanted to go back to I think the opening comments you made. You touched on this a little bit, but I wanted to ask just specifically how you are seeing China demand right now as it relates to NGLs and where do you think that\u2019s headed?\nBrent Secrest: Yes. Michael, this is Brent. If you look at \u2013 and let\u2019s take LPGs first that came from our terminal. At first quarter, that number was 24% of our volumes went to China. Second quarter, we averaged 38%. So, when you go back and talk about those PDH plants, I think that\u2019s some effect right there. And then when you go to ethane, first quarter, it was about 33%. Second quarter, 26% went to China. What Tug has been doing on ethane contracts, I think you will see that number go up of what\u2019s going to China.\nMichael Blum: Okay. Got it. And then just have like a broad question on drilling activity. Are there any regions you would highlight where you are just seeing a change in either reactivity or messaging from producers, either up or down?\nTony Chovanec: Yes. This is Tony, Michael. We are in the middle of earnings season and producers are reporting. But if you look at, think Exxon, think Chevron, Diamondback reported today. Everybody is saying the same thing. They continue to see drilling and completion efficiencies and not by a little. They are seeing cost mitigation and predicting, depending on where they are in the value chain, some amount of even deflation on costs. So, better returns. When you look at \u2013 the longer laterals are key to what they are doing, cube development. I mean the producer continues to get even more and more efficient. So, we look at it all the time. We talk about it. We talk about it with each of our producers. It\u2019s been difficult to look at the EIA numbers and try to figure out what production is doing, but I can tell you that we are on target for our own numbers to be in the 500,000 barrels a day to 700,000 barrels a day range increase year-end to year-end. And watch what the producers are saying on \u2013 during the second quarter. No one has a bad story. Everybody is very, very upbeat. And on top of that, I guess last but not least, our own calculation are ducts, so they continue to grow. So, not only are things going well for them, but they are building significant amount of headroom.\nMichael Blum: Haynesville?\nTony Chovanec: Haynesville rigs, let\u2019s look at completions there. Completions, frac crews in the Haynesville went from, call it, 15 to 18 down at a point to 7. They are back up to around 14 today. And if you look at the forward curve, the forward curve says Haynesville drillers should keep drilling, that they have value there. So, it is \u2013 the world is now watching it as that variable basin in the United States for natural gas production that could go, I am just going to use some generic numbers, it can go up 2 Bcf or it can go down 2 Bcf. And that\u2019s a 4 Bcf swing over in about an 18-month period. That\u2019s what you have seen through the cycles in Haynesville.\nMichael Blum: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning all. Thanks for the time. My first question is on Permian processing margins. Given Waha pricing, I am just wondering how do you see the margins going forward, including the impact from your fee floors.\nJim Teague: We think they will be better in the second half. They weren\u2019t great in the first half. Is that fair?\nNeal Dingmann: It\u2019s fair.\nBrent Secrest: I think the trend, if you model out the forward curve, which is a good thing, on the percent, it hits the floor, it gets a lot less.\nNeal Dingmann: Okay. Thanks Brent. And then second just on the marine exports of the LPG and ethane. I think you all previously mentioned strong demand. And Jim, I think you even mentioned, I think it was around 240,000 barrels a day of new contracts. Is this still expectations? Are you seeing kind of production continue to grow in this area?\nJim Teague: I think if you look at what we are doing, it kind of tells you what we believe. What we are doing is expanding our ability to export across the hydrocarbons chain. So, yes, we believe \u2013 if Tony is wrong, he will be somebody\u2019s houseboy, I guess because that\u2019s what we are doing.\nNeal Dingmann: Thank you, all.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nNeel Mitra: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask your exposure to spot ethane prices. Were you able to sell spot ethane out of maybe some of your purity storage in Mont Belvieu to downstream players and benefit from that? And conversely, did you have any downstream obligations like, possibly being short on Morgan\u2019s Point because of outages? Just wanted to see how that would kind of play out for 3Q now that we have a full month with prices over $0.30 a gallon.\nJim Teague: One of the most valuable assets we have is our storage. And yes, we were able to take advantage of the volatility on ethane. And no, we have no issues of being short at Morgan\u2019s Point or anywhere else.\nNeel Mitra: Great. And then second question, we started the year off in the first quarter with very high LPG exports, and then now, we are seasonally weaker in the second quarter. When does that seasonality start to pick up so that it\u2019s a benefit again for the second half of the year?\nJim Teague: Brent, let\u2019s let Tug take it, but I mean what\u2019s our export volume?\nTug Hanley: Yes, we are going to be a little a bit soft in the month of August.\nJim Teague: What do you call us up, 18 million barrels?\nTug Hanley: Yes, right around there.\nJim Teague: I don\u2019t call that soft.\nTug Hanley: But around September, we are fully booked up. And then I will just note as well that we are seeing duct margins increase specifically in the month of August and September forward.\nNeel Mitra: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I am currently showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Randy Burkhalter for closing remarks.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Norma. I think that covers it pretty well. I don\u2019t have any closing remarks. I just like to thank everybody for joining us today and for our call and have a good day. Goodbye now.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

So, as we talk to customers, what originally was going to be a strong second half is probably pushed out maybe 6 months or so. And then on the MTBE side, it's really a business that's driven by normal RBOB and octane. That remains strong. So, there were \u2013 there was a lot in your question. PDH, it's ramping up.

So, we're not adding any additional ethane-only capacity, rather what we like to call flex capacity. We're doing that in lieu of our Ref 4 expansion, and we're opting for a much smaller capital project at our Ship Channel facility to increase our butane loading rates and allow for fully refrigerated PGP. Butane, propylene, ethane, ethylene, you name it. Yes, we are going to be a little a bit soft in the month of August. Yes, right around there. But around September, we are fully booked up.

            "name": "Jim Teague",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Today, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 billion for the second quarter of \u201823 compared to $2.4 billion for the second quarter of \u201822 and $2.3 billion for the first quarter of \u201823. We generated $1.7 billion of DCF, providing 1.6x coverage. Enterprise retained $639 million of DCF in the second quarter, and we've retained $1.5 billion year-to-date. We had resilient financial results despite the impact of lower prices for crude and natural gas, NGLs, and petrochemicals. Our profits were negatively impacted by weaker processing margins for the first part of the year. Our petrochemical service segment continued to perform in spite of the low price and lower margin environment. During the quarter, we established six operational records, including our natural gas pipeline volumes, NGL fractionation volumes and 11.9 million barrels of oil equivalent of total pipeline volumes. We are also extremely proud of the fact that with the increase in our distribution last quarter, we crossed the threshold of 25 consecutive years of distribution growth, literally unheard of in the midstream industry. This is truly exceptional milestone across all industries and, most importantly, a real tribute to the core principles laid out from our very beginnings that Randa continues to prioritize today. Moving to growth capital, we started the second quarter with $6.1 billion in major growth projects under construction. We have since completed construction on four major growth projects that will provide new sources of cash. We have an additional $4.1 billion under construction. Completed major projects during the second quarter and early July include a 400 million cubic foot a day expansion of the Haynesville Extension of the Acadian natural gas pipeline system, which has sold out; our Poseidon cryogenic natural gas processing plant, which was our sixth processing plant in the Midland Basin, which is sold out; our 19th NGL fractionator, which is sold out; and our PDH 2 plant in Chambers County, which is sold out and ramping up currently between 65% and 70% and climbing. The three main \u2013 remaining natural gas processing plants we have under construction in the Permian Basin will go into service in late \u201823 and early \u201824, one in Midland and one in Delaware, and the first phase of the Texas Western products pipeline will be put into service in December. When we complete the next three Permian plants, we'll have 16 processing plants in the Permian, with a capability to process 3.8 Bcf a day of natural gas and extract more than 520,000 barrels a day of NGLs, all destined for additional value-added services in our Gulf Coast NGL systems. Meanwhile, downstream of the Permian, we have major expansions underway for ethane, ethylene, polymer-grade propane, propylene, and LPG, expanding and upgrading our export capacity at the Ship Channel at Morgan's Point and at Beaumont. Our new export projects are designed with an emphasis on flexibility and reliability, centered around a highly integrated footprint, with multi-product capabilities even as the world works its way through a significant petrochemical downturn, U.S. NGLs and olefins continue to get a lot of attention from petrochemicals focused on feedstock diversity and advantaged prices. In addition to multiple long-term export contracts we recently signed, we are also in discussions with counterparties from several countries for substantial amounts of additional natural gas liquids and olefin exports. This level of customer interest is what supports further expansion of our export capabilities. A wide gas-to-crude spread gives the petrochemical industry a feedstock advantage that is proving both durable and permanent. As Randy heard me say a million times, I grew up in that business and I've lived through more than a few cycles. Only the strong prospered through times like these, and U.S. NGL feedstocks sourced from shale, oil, and gas are again proving their growing importance. The durability of U.S. shales is evident in ever-increasing U.S. exports of crude, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and in exports of petrochemicals in various forms. In July, Enterprise crude oil exports will exceed a record 30 million barrels. Oil and gas has faced commodity price headwinds, especially compared to the premiums of last year when crude averaged over $100 a barrel during the first 6 months of 2022. We see no reason that crude should have been trading at the low levels of the last few months. In early June, OPEC+ announced they were extending their reductions into 2024. On top of that, the Saudis announced that they would unilaterally cut an additional 1.1 million barrels a day of production in July and August, with the option to extend these cuts as needed. Meanwhile, waterborne data confirms that Russia's exports are coming down. Inventories of crude and refined products, both in the U.S. and globally, remain very low, while OPEC+ continues to demonstrate they are committed to price stability. Even though industrial demand continues to lag, consumer demand is strong, especially in developed nations. Crude oil supply demand fundamentals continue to indicate that we're in store for much tighter balances for the remainder of the year and in 2024. And with that, I'll turn it over to Randy. Yes. This is Jim. I think we feel pretty constructive on the second half of the year. If we look at our processing margins, Natalie, they are better than they \u2013 they've been moving up. Okay. And in terms of outsized spreads, my experience is you can't predict them, but they're always there, and I think we might see more opportunity in the second half than we have seen in the first half. Chris, you got it? Where's Chris? We signed that contract, Tug, yesterday? Okay. You're about ready to execute it? The one that we're going to execute, I think, we've \u2013 we had one large one. I think it was 200,000 barrels a day that we executed recently. And we're in discussions with at least two more, Tug? Four more. And our guys are headed to Asia for an extended trip, not too long. So, I guess it's both, what we built and what we expect to sign. I got a lot of thoughts on that, Spiro. I was in a 2-hour meeting yesterday with Brent and Justin. So, you can imagine what it's like spending 2 hours with Brent and Justin looking at all of our options, all of our options. And our options could be we'll add another line called \u2013 what are we calling that? Bahia. Or we could partially loop Shin Oak and take Seminole out of NGL service. The bottom line is we have to have more takeaway out of the Permian. And, I guess I've got to have another 2 or 3 hours with Justin and Brent. We'll come up with a solution. Good morning. Go ahead, Brent. Hey. Graham, turn on your mic. We always talk \u2013 we worry about plants going down in the winter. What's 103 \u2013 temperature down? What about others? Well, I'm trying to get you to. That's propane. Is that all in? If not, it will still price to export, right? You're pretty observant, Jean Ann. Go ahead, Tug. So, Jean Ann, in our \u2013 in my script, I said multiproduct and flexibility, and that's what \u2013 so Tug can go to somebody and say, look, you can take three tanks of ethane and a tank of ethylene or you can take three tanks of ethane and a tank of propane, so \u2013 or vice versa. So, we're trying to get \u2013 fix it where those things will always be full, but not necessarily of the same product. We \u2013 I think we should have our license to construct, Graham, in September, October? In terms of \u2013 I mean, we're traveling the world on spot where we have a laser focus on getting customers on spot, and I think we will, and I believe we'll end up building it. Well, if Tug and Brent would get off their rear end and get to Asia and see everybody, we would probably \u2013 it would probably be sooner rather than later. But we are going to commercialize this thing. And we have got meetings. Brent and I are going to Europe later this month, Brent? In September. And the focus is on spot. We are pulling out all things to get it done. I say this every time, that's not guidance, but it's a goal, and we reward all of our employees once if we hit that goal. And somebody asked on one earnings call, have we ever had a goal that we didn't meet, we are bound and determined that our employees are going to be rewarded by meeting $9.3 billion goal. What's going to help us, I think is if you talk to Tony. I mean crude prices, I don't know what they are doing today, Tony, but they have been up $10 in the last, what...? 30 days. The balances are tight. All of our plants are full. The key \u2013 and Graham knows this. I think the key is to keep the plants running because we will capitalize on any volatility. I think in my script, what I have said is we set a record for loading crude onto ships in the month of... July. Thank you, Tony. And yes, Brent, I think you are seeing barrels move only towards Houston. And Brent before you answer that, but also talk about our quality improvements across the system. HOU. And Brent. I am not supposed to ask questions, but I will anyway. Where is Jay? How many of your cargoes have met dated Brent specs? One of the things about building plants is you could build them where you want them, and that's what I love about building all these plants in the Permian, and we are probably not through, and building the fractionator where you want it. So, that's my color. But Randy is the one you should ask. We think they will be better in the second half. They weren't great in the first half. Is that fair? I think if you look at what we are doing, it kind of tells you what we believe. What we are doing is expanding our ability to export across the hydrocarbons chain. So, yes, we believe \u2013 if Tony is wrong, he will be somebody's houseboy, I guess because that's what we are doing. One of the most valuable assets we have is our storage. And yes, we were able to take advantage of the volatility on ethane. And no, we have no issues of being short at Morgan's Point or anywhere else. Brent, let's let Tug take it, but I mean what's our export volume? What do you call us up, 18 million barrels? I don't call that soft."

            "content": "So, on ethane, I think what you saw last month is when nominations were due for ethane recoveries, the forward curve probably said not to recover. So, you saw a bunch of ethane get rejected in the Permian Basin. You couple that with some operational issues on various plants across the entire basin, there was probably some frac rates that were lower than normal, and that made ethane very, very tight. I think if you look out forward, I think some of that volatility is going to suppress, and I think we'd get back to probably more of a normal type ratio between ethane and natural gas. But there was a culmination of factors that caused that. And then just real quick on propane, when you look at just overall global demand, I think we've had four PDH plants come up in China so far this year. There's 11 other PDH plants scheduled to come online for the balance of this year. I mean, if you say 100% capacity factor, that's another 250,000 barrels a day. Those plants aren't running at those higher rates, but call it 65% to 70%. It'll certainly put another bid under propane just no matter how fast production comes online. I would hope that we've seen the bottom on propane. That's my hope. That's right. Yes. I mean, just to generalize this, Colton, I think everything's going to be centered around the Permian Basin. So, whether that's an NGL pipe solution, whether that's processing plants, or whether that's an additional fractionator, it's going to be all centered around Permian production growth. September. Yes. I mean, I think... I think fundamentally, we believe in Tony's production numbers as we go forward. We do think that the Corpus pipelines are full. We think that we have done \u2013 what we have done on our system as it relates to quality has brought more interest. And I do think when we speak to our customers, they want a bigger and bigger position in Houston. So, I think over time \u2013 and the other piece on this is not all pipelines are created equal. There is other pipelines that go to Houston or go to Beaumont that are more challenged than our integrated crude pipelines. So, I think we are going to be the beneficiary of these volumes going forward. HOU helps. Yes. I mean just the HOU being able to deliver and data Brent, and what we have done on our system, you are seeing the open interest on that contract continue to go up. We have sent records in the last couple of weeks on daily traded volume. I think ICE had a press release recently and went through some of those details. But all of this just put together lends itself to more interest in trying to get to Houston on our pipelines. Since we implemented the new quality specification mimicking the plot spec, we have met \u2013 every one of our export cargoes have met that specification since we adopted it in May. Yes. Michael, this is Brent. If you look at \u2013 and let's take LPGs first that came from our terminal. At first quarter, that number was 24% of our volumes went to China. Second quarter, we averaged 38%. So, when you go back and talk about those PDH plants, I think that's some effect right there. And then when you go to ethane, first quarter, it was about 33%. Second quarter, 26% went to China. What Tug has been doing on ethane contracts, I think you will see that number go up of what's going to China. I think the trend, if you model out the forward curve, which is a good thing, on the percent, it hits the floor, it gets a lot less."

So, curious if you could just opine on whether you are seeing incremental barrels and opportunity come back to Houston as Corpus remains full and if we continue to see green shoots into the back half of \u201823. Thanks. Great. Thanks for all the color. And maybe to just touch a little bit on M&A, commentary coming out of the Analyst Day, it seemed like it was coming or attractive for Enterprise. But with nothing year-to-date and EPD continuing to maintain its high bar for returns, just kind of curious if you could just give us a forward-looking update on potential M&A appetite or whether other uses of capital could impact the use of M&A going forward? Thanks. All make sense. I appreciate the color. Thanks."

            "name": "Randy Fowler",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Starting with the income statement, net income attributable to common unitholders for the second quarter of 2023 was $1.3 billion or $0.57 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.4 billion or $0.64 per common unit for the second quarter of last year. Adjusted cash flow from operations, or we call it adjusted CFFO, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital, was $1.9 billion for the second quarter of this year, compared to $2.1 billion for the second quarter of 2022. As Jim mentioned, 2023 marks our 25th consecutive year of distribution growth. We declared a distribution of $0.50 per common unit for the second quarter of 2023, which is a 5% \u2013 5.3% increase over the distribution declared for the second quarter of last year and a 2% increase over the distribution that we declared last quarter. This distribution will be paid August 14 to common holders of record as of close of business July 31. In the second quarter, we purchased 2.9 million common units for the quarter at a total cost of $75 million. For the first half of the year, unit purchases totaled approximately 3.6 million common units, for a total purchase price of approximately $92 million. Inclusive of these purchases, we have now utilized 41% of the authorized $2 billion buyback program. In addition, our distribution reinvestment plan and our employee unit purchase plan purchased an approximately 2 million common units on the open market, for a total purchase price of approximately $51 million, and that was also during the second quarter. For the 12 months ending June 30, 2023, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.2 billion in distributions to limited partners. These distributions, combined with $307 million in buybacks for this period, result in Enterprise having a payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations of 57% and a ratio of payout for adjusted free cash flow of 86%. Total capital investments in the second quarter of 2023 were $784 million, which included $683 million for growth capital projects and $101 million of sustaining capital expenditures. As Jim noted, we have $4.1 billion of major growth projects under construction, $1.1 billion of which are expected to begin service in the remainder of 2023. We continue to expect our growth capital expenditures for 2023 will be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion, depending on any incremental system expansions and timing. We continue to expect sustaining capital expenditures for 2023 will be approximately $400 million. Turning to capitalization. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $28.9 billion as of June 30. Assuming the final maturity date for our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio was 20 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.6%. And at June 30, approximately 97% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity at quarter-end was approximately $4 billion, and that includes both availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2023, our adjusted EBITDA was $9.1 billion. This compares to $8.8 billion for the trailing 12 months ending June 30 of 2022. We ended the quarter with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0x on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and reduced by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand. As a reminder, our leverage target remains 3x plus or minus 0.25. So, if you would, 2.75x to 3.25x. So, we are right in the middle of that range. And with that, Randy, I think we can open it up for questions. Yes. Tristan, on that, certainly getting PDH 2 completed, that was a big capital project. But when we come in and see the opportunities just in and around our system, I think, frankly, we're going to be in that $2 billion, $2.5 billion range for the next 2 to 3 years. And some of that, I'll have to say that $2 billion to $2.5 billion really is still excluding spot, which is still going through the licensing process. But hey, we're just seeing a lot of good activity, a lot of good growth opportunities across the system. Yes, Spiro. I think it comes back to, really, what you've seen out of us the last 2 or 3 years. It's sort of all of the above. Certainly, in the last year, year and a half, we've picked back up on the cadence of our distribution growth. So, we're \u2013 and again, that seems like the most direct way to return capital to our partners is through distribution bumps. But, I think we'll continue to come in and sort of use all of the above. Yes, Jeremy. Again, we're sort of in the middle of our range at 3.0x. And I think, again, the team is really bringing in some good commercial opportunities. We think growth CapEx would be $2 billion, $2.5 billion. And again, as I mentioned earlier, that is without spot. And so, I think we would just like to see it develop. As far as returning capital, we \u2013 I said we picked up the pace on distribution growth. Still doing some buybacks. Balance sheet is in great shape. And, Jeremy, I guess just staying in a position that \u2013 a lot of opportunities come along, and we just want to be in a good position to execute on them. Yes, Colton. Brent, do you want to take some of this because you are on the front line of it? Yes. Yes. It makes me want to go back and reread our transcripts from the Analyst Day. I didn't know we were that bullish on M&A. But yes, again, we will take a look at opportunities that come up. We are on every banker's rolodex [ph]. So, we get an opportunity to take a look and \u2013 but I can't say that we are predisposed to come in and jump on M&A if it makes sense, good return on capital, and if it fits the system, dovetails in, I think that's one discipline that we have had over the years. It's not building a collection of assets, but coming in and actually ties in and bolts onto our system and provides downstream or upstream opportunities. We will continue to look at that."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Randy Burkhalter, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Gigi, and welcome, everyone. Good morning, and welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss first quarter earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise's General Partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Teague : Thank you, Randy. Today, we announced Enterprise is off to another good start for the year. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 billion for the first quarter of '23. We generated $1.9 billion of distributable cash flow, providing 1.8x coverage. We retained $863 million of DCF for the first quarter. We reported 7 operating records and 1 financial record in the quarter, mostly related to our pipeline activities and export volumes across multiple commodities. We had record pipeline and fee-based natural gas processing volumes, record NGL and marine terminal volumes and near-record total marine terminal volumes. In March alone, our marine terminals loaded over 70 million barrels of NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals for export. Our NGL and natural gas pipeline businesses as well as our natural gas marketing and octane enhancement activities also reported strong increases in gross operating margin compared to the first quarter of last year. We also saw strong margins in our refined products business, offset by lower volumes in our propylene business, where PDH 1 was down for 24 days during the first quarter for planned maintenance. We remain on schedule to put approximately $3.8 billion of major projects in service this year. In the second quarter, we will commission PDH 2 and the expansion of the Acadian gas pipeline system. In the second half of the year, we will complete our 19th NGL fractionator, 2 natural gas processing plants in the Permian and put the first phase of the Texas Western Products Pipeline in service. We are running essentially full across all our assets, with the exception of the Rockies. We have significant expansions in our ethane, ethylene, propylene and LPG systems. We are upgrading export capacity and adding geographic diversity to our ethane export assets, with positions at Morgan's Point and now Beaumont, and expanding our LPG and propylene capacity at our Houston Ship Channel facility. Our ethylene export facility has been full since Day 1, and we're expanding that by 50%. Ethane exports have moved from being only consumed by a handful of niche players and point-to-point movements with significant growth in demand by several petrochemicals in Asia, Europe and the Americas. We recently completed new ethane export contracts that add 240,000 barrels a day with multiple counterparties. On SPOT, we received our recorded decision this past November and expect to get other permits in our license in the second half of the year. We are way ahead of other applicants, and we know what it takes to get a recorded decision. Two buoys and a motor boat to hook up to a ship won't cut it. We will have a 24/7 manned platform, vapor combustion and 2 pipelines that provide the ability to load multiple grades of crude oil and also able to evacuate those lines during a hurricane. Time is on our side as we commercialize this project, as we don't think it's needed until 2027. While the second quarter can be our weakest seasonally, we remain constructive on global market fundamentals even though the forward curve doesn't reflect that. In addition to low global inventories, we also note that OPEC+ seems to be intent on managing global balances. On the demand side, expectations for most consultants range from 1.4 million to 2 million barrels a day for global demand growth in 2023. OPEC+ economists say they are standing by their forecast of 2.3 million barrels a day demand growth by the end of 2023. From our perspective, that sounds rich, although the last 5 weeks, U.S. crude inventories have drawn 20 million barrels. Countering these bullish fundamentals are concerns about the global economies, with central banks continuing to signal additional rate increases to tame inflation. Meanwhile, while the Chinese continue to ramp up travel in a huge way, their industrial manufacturing surprised to the downside when their PMI turned negative yesterday. Regardless of the near-term mixed signals which continue to signal a range-bound market near term, for us it's very hard to make a bearish call for oil in the medium to long term. And it's hard for us to be too constructive on natural gas. A wide gas-to-crude spread gives U.S. petrochemicals a structural feedstock advantage that, in our view, is permanent. A case in point is the current operating environment, where the U.S. ethylene industry is the only region that has been consistently profitable, while the rest of the world have been very selective in what they crack and how they operate. Single-use plastics are doing good, they're profitable, while durables have their challenges and their headwinds. Meanwhile, the U.S. refining industry is one of the most competitive and technologically capable in the world. In short, we expect U.S. production to continue to grow, and we expect demand at our docks will likewise continue to grow. If you want to know where we're going, look at what we're doing. We continue to expand our ability to export hydrocarbons out of the U.S. to points all over the world where it's needed. With that, I'll turn it over to Randy.\nRandy Fowler : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Starting with income statement items. Net income attributable to common unitholders for the first quarter of 2023 increased 7.3% to $1.4 billion, or $0.63 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.3 billion, or $0.59 per common unit, for the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted cash flow from operations, or adjusted CFFO, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital, was $2 billion for both the first quarters of 2023 and 2022. We declared a distribution of $0.49 per common unit for the first quarter of 2023, which is 5.4% higher than the distribution declared for the first quarter of the prior year. This distribution will be paid May 12 to common unitholders of record as of close of business on April 28. As we mentioned on our February earnings call, we will evaluate another increase midyear. In March, we repurchased approximately 683,000 common units at an average price of $24.89 per unit, for a total cost of approximately $17 million. In addition, on a combined basis, our DRIP and employee unit purchase program purchased another 1.7 million common units on the open market during the quarter. For the 12 months ending March 31, 2023, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.2 billion of distributions to limited partners. In addition, we also repurchased $267 million of common units off the open market. As a result, our payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations was 55% for this period and our payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow was 75% for this 12-month period. Total capital investments in the first quarter of 2023 were $654 million, which included $570 million for organic growth capital projects and $84 million of sustaining capital expenditures. Our major growth projects that are sanctioned and under construction remains unchanged at $6.1 billion. We currently expect our 2023 growth capital expenditures will be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion, which includes possible expenditures associated with projects under development and not yet sanctioned. Frankly, I have a hard time seeing us get to the upper end of this range. The changes to our CapEx ranges for 2023 and 2024 since our recent Analyst Day are projects under development, which are substantially comprised of potential expansions of our Permian gathering and processing systems and our NGL distribution system, including exports. None of this creep is associated with cost overruns or delays. We expect 2023 sustaining capital expenditures will be approximately $400 million. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $28.9 billion at the end of the quarter. Assuming the final maturity of our hybrids, the weighted-average life of our debt portfolio was approximately 20 years. Our weighted-average cost of debt is 4.6%. At March 31, approximately 97% of our debt was fixed-rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $4 billion at the end of the first quarter, which includes $3.9 billion of availability under our credit facilities and $76 million of unrestricted cash on hand. In March 2023, we entered into a new $1.5 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement and a new $2.7 billion revolving multiyear agreement that matures in March 2028. These agreements replaced our prior credit facilities. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2023, our adjusted EBITDA increased 11.7% to $9.4 billion, compared to our trailing 12 months as of March 31, 2022. We ended the quarter with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0 on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and reduced by the partners' unrestricted cash on hand. Earlier this year, we announced a lower leverage target of 3.0x, plus or minus 1/4, or in a range from 2.75x to 3.25x. This change in financial policy, our lower leverage along with an established track record of growing stable fee-based cash flows and strong credit metrics resulted in Standard & Poor's upgrading our senior unsecured credit rating to A- with a stable outlook. We are appreciative of this recognition as the only A- rated midstream energy company. With that, Randy, we can open it up for questions.\nRandy Burkhalter: Okay. Thank you, Randy. Gigi, we would like to remind our listeners that when they ask questions to limit their questions to one question and one follow-up, please. We can go ahead and start our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis, from Citi.\nSpiro Dounis : First question, on petchem, was particularly strong this quarter, at least relative to what we had expected. And I know in the past, you had all talked about maybe a 6- to 9-month period or a lag on inventories getting worked down globally before that really started to tighten. And so I'm just curious, Jim, I know you mentioned the weaker-than-expected PMI, but is something happening maybe sooner than you all had expected? Or are we still sort of waiting to see that destocking effect take place later in the year?\nJim Teague: I'm going to let Chris D'Anna answer you.\nChris D'Anna : Spiro, I think what really happened in this first quarter is that it was more of a supply shortage than stronger demand. I mean, we had decent demand. Just coming off of the fourth quarter, it was really weak. But ultimately, it was reduced supply from a couple of PDHs being off-line.\nSpiro Dounis : Got it. Okay. That's helpful, Chris. Second question, just turning to Shin Oak. I know you all were sort of looking at potential alternatives there due to expanding that pipeline. Just curious if you can give us an update there on maybe what some of the potential alternatives could be and how you're thinking about the timing to make a decision there.\nJim Teague: I probably don't want to tell you what the alternatives are, but I will tell you we're trying to be capital-disciplined. And in the course of trying to do that, I guess we've kind of confused people. But we will loop Shin Oak. If we can find some options for that capital, then we'll probably do that. But make no mistake, our intent is we are going to look Shin Oak. And we've got a deadline -- and there's a deadline on the permit that we're going to have to be aware of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein.\nJean Ann Salisbury : NGL marketing has been falling in recent quarters and was quite low in this quarter. Can you talk through the drivers of this and if you see this as a trough?\nJim Teague: Lower commodity prices. But where is Doug?\nDouglas Kiste: I think if you look at what we did last quarter in 2022, the first quarter of 2022, I think we had some very good opportunities in that quarter with our storage program that we didn't have in the market this quarter. Commodity prices probably have a little bit to do with it, but there was just probably some opportunities last year that we didn't see this year.\nJean Ann Salisbury : Okay. That makes sense. And then kind of a broader question. Once the Houston Ship Channel is expanded, does Enterprise forecast Houston crude prices trading at least at parity to Corpus or maybe even at premium?\nJim Teague: Who wants to take that? Tony go\u2026\nAnthony Chovanec : So there's a couple of things we're doing, Jean Ann.\nJim Teague: Talk about the -- Jean Ann mentions it in her write-up. Talk about the -- Jean Ann says that the pipelines at Corpus are full.\nAnthony Chovanec : We're getting some incremental barrels kind of month-over-month, and I'd just say if you say Permian grows 40,000 to 50,000 barrels a month, that we're getting our fair share on the Houston Western pipelines. There is some premiums that happen at Corpus on the docks. I wouldn't say those premiums are that much higher, and I wouldn't say that they're day-in and day-out. I think what you're seeing us doing on our system, Jean Ann, is we've implemented a new quality program. And so if you look at the quality of crude oil that we're getting right now across our docks, it's the best quality that we've seen since we've been up in operation, and I think it compares with anything that Corpus can offer. So I think some of that is going to be equalized. Some of the freight advantages we'll have to overcome. But I think over time, if you look at where our program is going on crude oil, I think that we're going to eventually get there.\nJim Teague: And what was your objective in changing the -- why did we change quality mark?\nAnthony Chovanec : I mean, we did it for a couple of reasons. But I mean, one thing is we listened to our customers. We listened to our customers both on the production side, we listened to them on the refinery side here in Houston, and then also our export customers. But if you started going through the program and what we identified, there's probably a couple of folks out there that were trying to do a little bit too much aggressive blending, and we've effectively eliminated them and done a lot more routine testing in terms of maintaining the quality that we can offer these customers downstream. And ultimately, that's going to achieve higher prices.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Reynolds, from UBS.\nBrian Reynolds : Maybe just to talk on the distribution outlook and expectations. We've seen Enterprise raise kind of in that 1% to 5% range over the -- since 2018. Looking forward, with leverage below 3x and free cash flow still hovering around $1 billion after dividends in the next few years, kind of curious if we could see that DPU growth rate go above 5%? Or perhaps a little more CapEx kind of temper that distribution growth expectation?\nRandy Fowler: Brian, this is Randy. Thanks for the question. I think coming in and really looking at a range of 1% to 5% and going back to 2018, I would probably differ in my perspective of how I would look at it. Because from 2017 through, call it, 2020, 2021, we were really in a mode of transitioning from more of an external funding model to now more of an internal funding model. And so we were very measured on what we did in distribution growth to be able to grow into that internally funded model. Since that point in time, I would really say since over the last couple of years, 2 years, we have grown more in the range of, call it, 4% to 6%. And like I said, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we'll come in and discuss with the board here middle of this year as far as what we want to do for the rest of this year on distribution growth. And again, we've demonstrated good EBITDA growth. Jim mentioned $3.8 billion worth of projects going into service for the remainder of the year. That gives us good cash flow growth that will support distribution growth down the road. And I really hate to come in and get more granular than that because I don't want to usurp our board or front-run our board. But I think we'll look to continue to come in and provide distribution growth and buybacks, for that matter, as far as getting capital back to investors.\nBrian Reynolds : Great. Appreciate it. We'll wait for that midyear update. And then as my follow-up question, I'll take the CapEx question. Projects under development have increased by $1 billion for '23 and '24. You talked about in your prepared remarks that you see limited ability to get to the high end of that range. So kind of curious if you can just talk about perhaps some of the projects in the hopper? And then within the existing CapEx backlog, was there any CapEx inflation or perhaps pull-forward of CapEx into '23 and '24 that we should be thinking about?\nRandy Fowler: I'll take the first part of the question. There was not any cost of any overruns or delays on projects. In fact, Graham and his engineering team have done a great job of delivering projects on time and, more often than not, slightly under budget. And really, the change that we've had since Analyst Day are more projects that, I guess, we've got a good bit of confidence in and we included them in the range, but they're still subject to being completely underwritten through commercial contracts. And I'd rather not elaborate into much detail. We'll just come in and go back in. And again, what I said in the prepared remarks, and a lot of it is what we talked about at our Analyst Day, where we're seeing most of the opportunities for growth are gathering and processing in the Permian, broadly. It is also in our NGL distribution system, including export facilities. So just seeing a lot of demand on that front.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum from Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum : I wanted to ask about the marine export, particularly the LPG and SA that came in really strong this quarter. Just want to get your color on the market, what demand looks like, and do you think these levels are sustainable from here.\nJim Teague: Tug, do you want to take that? \nTug Hanley : This is Tug. We did definitely see strong demand this last quarter, and we're going to expect to continue to see that demand. Really it comes down to productions continue to grow. It's still a supply push and the barrels still having the price to clear across the water.\nJim Teague: Michael, I was -- I've been surprised, pleasantly so, at how well we've done on our ethane exports. And I'm surprised that we're able to do 240,000 barrels a day of new contracts, with more to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson from Scotiabank.\nTristan Richardson : Could you talk a little bit about PDH 2 and, overall in the petchem segment, how should we think maybe about that fee-based mix pro forma once that asset comes online relative to the sort of 70-ish percent fee-based we typically see in that segment?\nJim Teague: I think this one is 100% fee-based, isn't it, Chris?\nChris D'Anna : That's correct.\nJim Teague: So it's 100% fee-based, with all creditworthy customers, and we always -- Graham is sitting to my left. They always come in. We can do more than whatever the nameplate is. So we'll probably have some extra pounds to play with.\nTristan Richardson : Great. And then maybe just on EHT export expansion, could you talk a little bit about the mix of products you're seeing? I mean, you talked a lot about refrigeration at Analyst Day, and I think you highlighted that that expansion could be 120,000 a day. Should we think of it as pretty fungible across products or primarily focused on LPG? And then could the scope change for that project, just given sort of the strength you're seeing across the dock indicated by the first quarter?\nBrent Secrest : This is Brent. So I think in terms of where it stands right now, it's propane, butane and some propylene slated to come on the second half of '25. We continue to look, Tristan, at is there another project there, but it's all under evaluation. But right now, it's slated to come on the second half of '25.\nAnthony Chovanec : And I just want to correct a number. You said 120,000 barrels a day. Our LPG export expansion is north of 170,000 barrels a day.\nJim Teague: And we're talking about the ship channel widening. You might explain that. Bob, can you explain what you get out of the ship channel widening for Tristan?\nAnthony Chovanec : Yes, sir. So when Project 11 is complete on the widening, which we expect to be by the end of '24, first quarter of '25, it will add 4 to 5 hours of daylight. And most of the products we deal with are daylight-restricted. So that's easily an incremental 15% to 20% additional cargoes that can come in if needs be.\nJim Teague: Which means, Zach, you sell out your refrigeration then.\nZachary Strait : The contract.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill : I guess a lot of ground has been covered, but could I ask on processing margins in the Permian and kind of relative to your fee floors? Obviously, Waha is seeing a lot of pressure. So are we kind of at those fee floors for Waha at this point? And then also just an update on kind of how you're thinking about, I think it's 400 Mcf a day of latent capacity on your Texas intrastate pipelines, just how you're thinking about that, still holding it open or contracting it up? And updates on kind of how you see Permian natural gas egress between the brownfield additions and the Matterhorn when it comes online?\nJim Teague: Natalie and Tug.\nNatalie Gayden : I'll answer the fee floor question. Post Navitas, for the first quarter of '23, we did hit more fee floors than, I guess, the end of '22. But less volume is being subject to the fee floor. So I'd call it 75% of the volume. And it's not very far under the fee floor. So long story short, I see probably upside for the rest of the year.\nTug Hanley : This is Tug. On the pipeline capacity question, we still have open pipeline capacity. We are utilizing it every day as marketing. But just like every decision here at Enterprise, if there's an opportunity to work with Natalie for a long-term contract opportunity, we'll evaluate that, we'll evaluate to continue to hold it open for SPOT opportunity.\nJim Teague: When we feel like it's the right time, we will contract that capacity.\nChase Mulvehill : Okay. Great. Makes sense. An unrelated follow-up on octane enhancement. You're still generating some nice gross operating margin there and really some nice non-fee gross operating margin as RBOB and butane spreads are still wide. So I'd be curious kind of your thoughts on how you see these spreads playing out the rest of '23 and how much you have hedged at this point.\nJim Teague: Do you want me to take it? Or do you want to? So we have -- right now, I think that octane enhancement is about 75% hedged. We feel pretty good about where those margins are going to be. There was an earlier question about LPG pricing. And I think as you see this production come on, you look at the ability for propane and butane to go find markets, I could see that being somewhat challenged, and that's to the benefit of our octane enhancement program. Are we going to see as good margins that we saw from the MTB uplift that we saw earlier this year? Probably not, but it's still a very good business for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities LLC.\nJeremy Tonet : Just wanted to kind of pick up a bit, I guess, on the Permian and natural gas. There's been some conversation out there with GOR ratios increasing. And just wondering if you could talk about what your experience or thoughts are there and how you see that, I guess, kind of impacting basin production, that's helpful.\nAnthony Chovanec : Jeremy, this is Tony.\nJeremy Tonet : And takeaway dynamics.\nAnthony Chovanec : Okay. Go ahead. All right. Yes, GORs, when we looked at the basin holistically, are absolutely going up. It's largely driven by the preponderance of drilling into more gassy areas, and think Delaware Basin compared to, say, the Midland Basin. So there's no question that the GORs are going up. And that's how midstreams are contracting, and that's what producers are doing. Producers look at their portfolio. They look at what they plan to drill. And gas GORs, the decline over time, oil declines faster than natural gas does. So that impacts the long-term outlook in this regard.\nJim Teague: Does that mean you'll have less crude?\nAnthony Chovanec : Jim wanted to know, does that mean you have less crude? And I think there's a misconception, thanks for that, Jim, that we don't have the amount of crude that we had before because of GORs. And that absolutely is not the fact. And you can look at our forecasts, which we stand by. You have a lot of both. That's the bottom line. You have a lot of crude. There's been no change in those curves as we forecast. You have a lot of very rich gas. So the answer is it doesn't mean less crude. And ultimately, this is not a bad story. It's not a bad story for Enterprise. It's a great story.\nJeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful there. And then just wanted to kind of come back to the LPG and petchem side, and you've touched on this a few different times across the call. But just wanted to see, I guess, what patterns you're seeing over the balance of the year. LPG exports, is that kind of onetime in nature and surprise? Do you see this strength continuing? People are concerned about a recession. How do you see LPG exports in petchem, I guess, kind of being impacted by these trends, looking forward?\nJim Teague: I think, and I'll hand it to Brent, LPG has got a price to export, period. And price creates demand. And it's going to have to price to export, and there will be demand for it. Brent?\nBrent Secrest : I mean, the only thing I'd add, it's our fundamental belief that it will have to go fight to maintain some sort of margin. If there's some sort of issue, obviously, at Enterprise, we have a pretty good shock absorber, which is our storage footprint. And if we can play to sell, because there's another question about LPG exports. And why we're expanding our export capacity is because the market needs it. And if you look at infrastructure bottlenecks, our belief is that as the production comes online, it will price to export. But at some point, the export capacity isn't going to be there. And that's an opportunity for folks like Enterprise to participate in that market. And if you go out even further and you look at the overall demand, especially what's coming out of China with PDHs, there's going to be a period of time in there in '25, '26, '27 time frame where the U.S. producer has to catch up to the overall capacity and the overall demand. But all this is going to be healthy for the system.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Colton Bean from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.\nColton Bean : Randy, coming back to Brian's question from a different angle, do you all view leverage as more of an output? Or are you intent on managing towards the target range? Meaning, are there any items you view as a balancing mechanism, whether that be distribution growth, buybacks, CapEx? Or would you let leverage drift below the range in any given year?\nRandy Fowler: Colton, the range that we have out there I think is a sufficient range for us for the foreseeable future. It really comes in and gives us a lot of flexibility to come in and fund organic growth. If we see a surge in organic growth projects, I think it gives us the flexibility to handle that, stay in the range. I think it gives us the flexibility to come in and if we see an acquisition opportunity that we want to use cash or incur debt for, I think it gives us plenty of flexibility to do that as well as come in and continue to provide distribution growth and buybacks. So I know I'm not probably answering the question the way you wanted it to, but that range of 2.75x to 3.25x gives us a lot of flexibility. And when we get all these new growth capital projects coming online, and again, we've got a lot under construction now, I think we'll see more of that EBITDA, certainly full year of that EBITDA, show up in 2024, 2025. And then I think at that point in time, we'll reassess.\nColton Bean : Okay. And so it sounds like for the near term, expecting to stay within that range. And the question was more angled towards it seems like you guys are more likely to break the bottom end than the top end. And so just if we'd see a ramp in distribution growth or buybacks if it looks like you all were drifting into, call it, mid-2s or even low 2s?\nRandy Fowler: Colton, I'd just hate to get the cart ahead of the horse. Let us get there first, and let us see what the situation looks like when that prevails. And I think we're going to do the responsible thing once we get to that point.\nColton Bean : That's perfect. And then maybe shifting over to gathering. So I think there's a $25 million step-up in the Rocky Mountain region called out. From what we were seeing, it looked like regional pricing was actually down specifically in the San Juan's, which I think is where you have those gathering fees indexed. So I guess, can you explain kind of what the uplift was there quarter-on-quarter?\nRandy Fowler: Really, I think, Colton, what we were seeing was really for a period of time, I think especially January, we really saw strong natural gas prices more driven by California, both up in the Rockies and in the San Juan. Tony, I don't know if you want to...\nAnthony Chovanec : Completely agree. Phenomenal prices. Definitely an outlier. And that's because the utilities just want to prepare and say we have to have the gas.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays.\nTheresa Chen : I wanted to touch on the near-term demand outlook for U.S. LPG exports a bit more. Going back to your comments about the Chinese PDH unit, what are you seeing in terms of the pace and ramp of them? And do you think there could be an incremental bid for U.S. cargoes later on this year due to lower LPG exports from Saudi Arabia and Qatar?\nRandy Fowler: I'm sorry, Theresa. What was the first part of that question?\nTheresa Chen : Chinese PDH unit ramp.\nRandy Fowler: I mean, so I think you're seeing quite a few PDHs come online this year. You'll see some next year and then obviously the year after. I don't know if the run rates are going to be sustainable in terms of what they're doing right now. I think they're doing probably around 70%. There'll be some opportunities for LPG exports. I think the overall propane consumption is only going to increase. I just don't know if there's run rates over there in China are going to be able to be maintained. If you look at our opportunities, we have the availability of some spots. Those will probably get filled up, but it's not a ton. It's probably 2 or 3 spots a month, Tug, that we have available, right?\nJim Teague: It still goes back to the gas-to-crude spread as to how much those PDHs run. And as we said in our script, we can't make a bearish case medium to long term on crude prices, and we're not constructive on natural gas. So inherent net gas-to-crude spread ought to be more LPG and ethylene plants and PDH plants in Asia.\nTheresa Chen : And the second part of the question related to U.S. LPG cargoes potentially getting a bid due to OPEC production cuts.\nJim Teague: By definition, I think if they cut crude, they cut LPG, Tug.\nTug Hanley : They do. But just, Theresa, they're not huge LPG exporters anyway. And they've been really outspoken that, at least for now, incremental barrels, whether they're up or down, will affect internal consumption. So they're just another balancing item in a market where barrels are pricing to get consumed. It's just not -- we don't see it as a big factor.\nTheresa Chen : Understood. And Brent, going back to your comments about infrastructure bottlenecks on the LPG export front down the line eventually, where do you think the export constraint will come about? Is it dock space? Is it refridge capacity? Is it tonnage? What does that look like?\nBrent Secrest : I mean, I think it's refridge capacity. That's where it starts to begin with. And I don't -- if you look at what the industry is doing right now, we're running at pretty high rates. The dock piece is easily -- easier to solve. But on the front end, I would probably say it's going to be refridge capacity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley : I wanted to start with a follow-up on CapEx. So you're at about $2.5 billion this year. I think the potential spend for next year, $2 billion to $2.5 billion. A couple of years ago, I think the company talked to $1.5 billion to $2 billion as somewhat of a run rate for CapEx. So should we think of '23 and '24 as elevated CapEx years? Or is the run rate now higher just as the company continues to grow?\nBrent Secrest : Keith, the opportunities are there. Just good opportunities at the time. What '26 and '27 looks like, we'll let you know when we get closer to that point. But right now, we just see a lot of good opportunities both on the upstream side and the downstream side.\nJim Teague: We're bringing on $3.8 billion worth of major projects this year. If you take our PDH 2 plant, our fractionator, our Acadian expansion, those will all be full on Day 1.\nKeith Stanley : Second question, just you rolled out the Project 9.3 last quarter. At a high level, any areas of the business that are going better than planned? Any lighter than planned? Just any high-level comments on progress towards that internal target?\nJim Teague: We probably -- we have probably, on petrochemicals, we're over plan. So other than -- I can't think of anything other than the Rockies and I guess our Eagle Ford crude pipeline as we're hustling that. So other than that, Zach, have you got anything going? I hadn't called on you. So I felt the need to call on you.\nZachary Strait : I think segment by segment we're pretty close to where we planned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from Truist.\nNeal Dingmann : My first is on shareholder return. I'm just wondering, given how strong your financial position continues to be, with over $4 billion of liquidity, I'm just wondering what factors go into the decision on the unit repurchase on a go-forward.\nRandy Fowler: Neal, it really -- I guess, we had talked that the buyback program is still more of an opportunistic program right now. And I guess good news/bad news is, frankly, in the first quarter we didn't see a lot of good opportunities. When we -- in the month of March, I think around the Silicon Valley Bank failure, there was more volatility in the market and the units were under pressure. And we saw good value, and we came in and executed then. Just our window wasn't long enough. We would like to have bought more, but the units rallied pretty quickly on the heels of that.\nNeal Dingmann : That's great. It's great to hear. And then my second question, on petrochem specifically, it looks like the propylene side was slightly down, just largely, I think, mostly just on the planned maintenance. So I'm just wondering, can you remind me of any major planned maintenance for the remainder of the year, specifically for that propylene production facilities?\nJim Teague: Graham, have you got any?\nGraham Bacon : We've currently got a couple of splitters and down for a planned maintenance after that.\nJim Teague: We've got a couple of splitters down right now for planned maintenance. But after that, I think we're done for the year.\nRandy Fowler: And those splitter turnarounds, they're not going to -- they're not material to any financials.\nJim Teague: I'm going to hold you to that.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Randy Burkhalter for closing remarks.\nRandy Burkhalter: Thank you, Gigi. That concludes our call today, everyone, and we'd like to thank our listeners for joining us today. And have a great rest of your day, and goodbye for now.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Looking forward, with leverage below 3x and free cash flow still hovering around $1 billion after dividends in the next few years, kind of curious if we could see that DPU growth rate go above 5%? Or perhaps a little more CapEx kind of temper that distribution growth expectation? Great. Appreciate it. We'll wait for that midyear update. And then as my follow-up question, I'll take the CapEx question. Projects under development have increased by $1 billion for '23 and '24. You talked about in your prepared remarks that you see limited ability to get to the high end of that range. So kind of curious if you can just talk about perhaps some of the projects in the hopper?

On the pipeline capacity question, we still have open pipeline capacity. We are utilizing it every day as marketing. But just like every decision here at Enterprise, if there's an opportunity to work with Natalie for a long-term contract opportunity, we'll evaluate that, we'll evaluate to continue to hold it open for SPOT opportunity. They do. But just, Theresa, they're not huge LPG exporters anyway.

            "name": "Jim Teague",
            "content": "Thank you, Randy. Today, we announced Enterprise is off to another good start for the year. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 billion for the first quarter of '23. We generated $1.9 billion of distributable cash flow, providing 1.8x coverage. We retained $863 million of DCF for the first quarter. We reported 7 operating records and 1 financial record in the quarter, mostly related to our pipeline activities and export volumes across multiple commodities. We had record pipeline and fee-based natural gas processing volumes, record NGL and marine terminal volumes and near-record total marine terminal volumes. In March alone, our marine terminals loaded over 70 million barrels of NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals for export. Our NGL and natural gas pipeline businesses as well as our natural gas marketing and octane enhancement activities also reported strong increases in gross operating margin compared to the first quarter of last year. We also saw strong margins in our refined products business, offset by lower volumes in our propylene business, where PDH 1 was down for 24 days during the first quarter for planned maintenance. We remain on schedule to put approximately $3.8 billion of major projects in service this year. In the second quarter, we will commission PDH 2 and the expansion of the Acadian gas pipeline system. In the second half of the year, we will complete our 19th NGL fractionator, 2 natural gas processing plants in the Permian and put the first phase of the Texas Western Products Pipeline in service. We are running essentially full across all our assets, with the exception of the Rockies. We have significant expansions in our ethane, ethylene, propylene and LPG systems. We are upgrading export capacity and adding geographic diversity to our ethane export assets, with positions at Morgan's Point and now Beaumont, and expanding our LPG and propylene capacity at our Houston Ship Channel facility. Our ethylene export facility has been full since Day 1, and we're expanding that by 50%. Ethane exports have moved from being only consumed by a handful of niche players and point-to-point movements with significant growth in demand by several petrochemicals in Asia, Europe and the Americas. We recently completed new ethane export contracts that add 240,000 barrels a day with multiple counterparties. On SPOT, we received our recorded decision this past November and expect to get other permits in our license in the second half of the year. We are way ahead of other applicants, and we know what it takes to get a recorded decision. Two buoys and a motor boat to hook up to a ship won't cut it. We will have a 24/7 manned platform, vapor combustion and 2 pipelines that provide the ability to load multiple grades of crude oil and also able to evacuate those lines during a hurricane. Time is on our side as we commercialize this project, as we don't think it's needed until 2027. While the second quarter can be our weakest seasonally, we remain constructive on global market fundamentals even though the forward curve doesn't reflect that. In addition to low global inventories, we also note that OPEC+ seems to be intent on managing global balances. On the demand side, expectations for most consultants range from 1.4 million to 2 million barrels a day for global demand growth in 2023. OPEC+ economists say they are standing by their forecast of 2.3 million barrels a day demand growth by the end of 2023. From our perspective, that sounds rich, although the last 5 weeks, U.S. crude inventories have drawn 20 million barrels. Countering these bullish fundamentals are concerns about the global economies, with central banks continuing to signal additional rate increases to tame inflation. Meanwhile, while the Chinese continue to ramp up travel in a huge way, their industrial manufacturing surprised to the downside when their PMI turned negative yesterday. Regardless of the near-term mixed signals which continue to signal a range-bound market near term, for us it's very hard to make a bearish call for oil in the medium to long term. And it's hard for us to be too constructive on natural gas. A wide gas-to-crude spread gives U.S. petrochemicals a structural feedstock advantage that, in our view, is permanent. A case in point is the current operating environment, where the U.S. ethylene industry is the only region that has been consistently profitable, while the rest of the world have been very selective in what they crack and how they operate. Single-use plastics are doing good, they're profitable, while durables have their challenges and their headwinds. Meanwhile, the U.S. refining industry is one of the most competitive and technologically capable in the world. In short, we expect U.S. production to continue to grow, and we expect demand at our docks will likewise continue to grow. If you want to know where we're going, look at what we're doing. We continue to expand our ability to export hydrocarbons out of the U.S. to points all over the world where it's needed. With that, I'll turn it over to Randy. I'm going to let Chris D'Anna answer you. I probably don't want to tell you what the alternatives are, but I will tell you we're trying to be capital-disciplined. And in the course of trying to do that, I guess we've kind of confused people. But we will loop Shin Oak. If we can find some options for that capital, then we'll probably do that. But make no mistake, our intent is we are going to look Shin Oak. And we've got a deadline -- and there's a deadline on the permit that we're going to have to be aware of. Lower commodity prices. But where is Doug? Who wants to take that? Tony go... Talk about the -- Jean Ann mentions it in her write-up. Talk about the -- Jean Ann says that the pipelines at Corpus are full. And what was your objective in changing the -- why did we change quality mark? Tug, do you want to take that? Michael, I was -- I've been surprised, pleasantly so, at how well we've done on our ethane exports. And I'm surprised that we're able to do 240,000 barrels a day of new contracts, with more to come. I think this one is 100% fee-based, isn't it, Chris? So it's 100% fee-based, with all creditworthy customers, and we always -- Graham is sitting to my left. They always come in. We can do more than whatever the nameplate is. So we'll probably have some extra pounds to play with. And we're talking about the ship channel widening. You might explain that. Bob, can you explain what you get out of the ship channel widening for Tristan? Which means, Zach, you sell out your refrigeration then. Natalie and Tug. When we feel like it's the right time, we will contract that capacity. Do you want me to take it? Or do you want to? So we have -- right now, I think that octane enhancement is about 75% hedged. We feel pretty good about where those margins are going to be. There was an earlier question about LPG pricing. And I think as you see this production come on, you look at the ability for propane and butane to go find markets, I could see that being somewhat challenged, and that's to the benefit of our octane enhancement program. Are we going to see as good margins that we saw from the MTB uplift that we saw earlier this year? Probably not, but it's still a very good business for us. Does that mean you'll have less crude? I think, and I'll hand it to Brent, LPG has got a price to export, period. And price creates demand. And it's going to have to price to export, and there will be demand for it. Brent? It still goes back to the gas-to-crude spread as to how much those PDHs run.

I hadn't called on you. So I felt the need to call on you. Graham, have you got any? We've got a couple of splitters down right now for planned maintenance. But after that, I think we're done for the year. I'm going to hold you to that."

            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Starting with income statement items. Net income attributable to common unitholders for the first quarter of 2023 increased 7.3% to $1.4 billion, or $0.63 per common unit on a fully diluted basis. This compares to $1.3 billion, or $0.59 per common unit, for the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted cash flow from operations, or adjusted CFFO, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital, was $2 billion for both the first quarters of 2023 and 2022. We declared a distribution of $0.49 per common unit for the first quarter of 2023, which is 5.4% higher than the distribution declared for the first quarter of the prior year. This distribution will be paid May 12 to common unitholders of record as of close of business on April 28. As we mentioned on our February earnings call, we will evaluate another increase midyear. In March, we repurchased approximately 683,000 common units at an average price of $24.89 per unit, for a total cost of approximately $17 million. In addition, on a combined basis, our DRIP and employee unit purchase program purchased another 1.7 million common units on the open market during the quarter. For the 12 months ending March 31, 2023, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.2 billion of distributions to limited partners. In addition, we also repurchased $267 million of common units off the open market. As a result, our payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations was 55% for this period and our payout ratio of adjusted free cash flow was 75% for this 12-month period. Total capital investments in the first quarter of 2023 were $654 million, which included $570 million for organic growth capital projects and $84 million of sustaining capital expenditures. Our major growth projects that are sanctioned and under construction remains unchanged at $6.1 billion. We currently expect our 2023 growth capital expenditures will be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion, which includes possible expenditures associated with projects under development and not yet sanctioned. Frankly, I have a hard time seeing us get to the upper end of this range. The changes to our CapEx ranges for 2023 and 2024 since our recent Analyst Day are projects under development, which are substantially comprised of potential expansions of our Permian gathering and processing systems and our NGL distribution system, including exports. None of this creep is associated with cost overruns or delays. We expect 2023 sustaining capital expenditures will be approximately $400 million. Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $28.9 billion at the end of the quarter. Assuming the final maturity of our hybrids, the weighted-average life of our debt portfolio was approximately 20 years. Our weighted-average cost of debt is 4.6%. At March 31, approximately 97% of our debt was fixed-rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $4 billion at the end of the first quarter, which includes $3.9 billion of availability under our credit facilities and $76 million of unrestricted cash on hand. In March 2023, we entered into a new $1.5 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement and a new $2.7 billion revolving multiyear agreement that matures in March 2028. These agreements replaced our prior credit facilities. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2023, our adjusted EBITDA increased 11.7% to $9.4 billion, compared to our trailing 12 months as of March 31, 2022. We ended the quarter with a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.0 on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and reduced by the partners' unrestricted cash on hand. Earlier this year, we announced a lower leverage target of 3.0x, plus or minus 1/4, or in a range from 2.75x to 3.25x. This change in financial policy, our lower leverage along with an established track record of growing stable fee-based cash flows and strong credit metrics resulted in Standard & Poor's upgrading our senior unsecured credit rating to A- with a stable outlook. We are appreciative of this recognition as the only A- rated midstream energy company. With that, Randy, we can open it up for questions. Brian, this is Randy. Thanks for the question. I think coming in and really looking at a range of 1% to 5% and going back to 2018, I would probably differ in my perspective of how I would look at it. Because from 2017 through, call it, 2020, 2021, we were really in a mode of transitioning from more of an external funding model to now more of an internal funding model. And so we were very measured on what we did in distribution growth to be able to grow into that internally funded model. Since that point in time, I would really say since over the last couple of years, 2 years, we have grown more in the range of, call it, 4% to 6%. And like I said, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we'll come in and discuss with the board here middle of this year as far as what we want to do for the rest of this year on distribution growth. And again, we've demonstrated good EBITDA growth. Jim mentioned $3.8 billion worth of projects going into service for the remainder of the year. That gives us good cash flow growth that will support distribution growth down the road. And I really hate to come in and get more granular than that because I don't want to usurp our board or front-run our board. But I think we'll look to continue to come in and provide distribution growth and buybacks, for that matter, as far as getting capital back to investors. I'll take the first part of the question. There was not any cost of any overruns or delays on projects. In fact, Graham and his engineering team have done a great job of delivering projects on time and, more often than not, slightly under budget. And really, the change that we've had since Analyst Day are more projects that, I guess, we've got a good bit of confidence in and we included them in the range, but they're still subject to being completely underwritten through commercial contracts. And I'd rather not elaborate into much detail. We'll just come in and go back in. And again, what I said in the prepared remarks, and a lot of it is what we talked about at our Analyst Day, where we're seeing most of the opportunities for growth are gathering and processing in the Permian, broadly. It is also in our NGL distribution system, including export facilities. So just seeing a lot of demand on that front. Colton, the range that we have out there I think is a sufficient range for us for the foreseeable future. It really comes in and gives us a lot of flexibility to come in and fund organic growth. If we see a surge in organic growth projects, I think it gives us the flexibility to handle that, stay in the range. I think it gives us the flexibility to come in and if we see an acquisition opportunity that we want to use cash or incur debt for, I think it gives us plenty of flexibility to do that as well as come in and continue to provide distribution growth and buybacks. So I know I'm not probably answering the question the way you wanted it to, but that range of 2.75x to 3.25x gives us a lot of flexibility. And when we get all these new growth capital projects coming online, and again, we've got a lot under construction now, I think we'll see more of that EBITDA, certainly full year of that EBITDA, show up in 2024, 2025. And then I think at that point in time, we'll reassess. Colton, I'd just hate to get the cart ahead of the horse. Let us get there first, and let us see what the situation looks like when that prevails. And I think we're going to do the responsible thing once we get to that point. Really, I think, Colton, what we were seeing was really for a period of time, I think especially January, we really saw strong natural gas prices more driven by California, both up in the Rockies and in the San Juan. Tony, I don't know if you want to... I'm sorry, Theresa. What was the first part of that question? I mean, so I think you're seeing quite a few PDHs come online this year. You'll see some next year and then obviously the year after. I don't know if the run rates are going to be sustainable in terms of what they're doing right now. I think they're doing probably around 70%. There'll be some opportunities for LPG exports. I think the overall propane consumption is only going to increase. I just don't know if there's run rates over there in China are going to be able to be maintained. If you look at our opportunities, we have the availability of some spots. Those will probably get filled up, but it's not a ton. It's probably 2 or 3 spots a month, Tug, that we have available, right? Neal, it really -- I guess, we had talked that the buyback program is still more of an opportunistic program right now. And I guess good news/bad news is, frankly, in the first quarter we didn't see a lot of good opportunities. When we -- in the month of March, I think around the Silicon Valley Bank failure, there was more volatility in the market and the units were under pressure. And we saw good value, and we came in and executed then. Just our window wasn't long enough. We would like to have bought more, but the units rallied pretty quickly on the heels of that. And those splitter turnarounds, they're not going to -- they're not material to any financials."

            "content": "So there's a couple of things we're doing, Jean Ann. We're getting some incremental barrels kind of month-over-month, and I'd just say if you say Permian grows 40,000 to 50,000 barrels a month, that we're getting our fair share on the Houston Western pipelines. There is some premiums that happen at Corpus on the docks. I wouldn't say those premiums are that much higher, and I wouldn't say that they're day-in and day-out. I think what you're seeing us doing on our system, Jean Ann, is we've implemented a new quality program. And so if you look at the quality of crude oil that we're getting right now across our docks, it's the best quality that we've seen since we've been up in operation, and I think it compares with anything that Corpus can offer. So I think some of that is going to be equalized. Some of the freight advantages we'll have to overcome. But I think over time, if you look at where our program is going on crude oil, I think that we're going to eventually get there. I mean, we did it for a couple of reasons. But I mean, one thing is we listened to our customers. We listened to our customers both on the production side, we listened to them on the refinery side here in Houston, and then also our export customers. But if you started going through the program and what we identified, there's probably a couple of folks out there that were trying to do a little bit too much aggressive blending, and we've effectively eliminated them and done a lot more routine testing in terms of maintaining the quality that we can offer these customers downstream. And ultimately, that's going to achieve higher prices. And I just want to correct a number. You said 120,000 barrels a day. Our LPG export expansion is north of 170,000 barrels a day. Yes, sir. So when Project 11 is complete on the widening, which we expect to be by the end of '24, first quarter of '25, it will add 4 to 5 hours of daylight. And most of the products we deal with are daylight-restricted. So that's easily an incremental 15% to 20% additional cargoes that can come in if needs be. Jeremy, this is Tony. Okay. Go ahead. All right. Yes, GORs, when we looked at the basin holistically, are absolutely going up. It's largely driven by the preponderance of drilling into more gassy areas, and think Delaware Basin compared to, say, the Midland Basin. So there's no question that the GORs are going up. And that's how midstreams are contracting, and that's what producers are doing. Producers look at their portfolio. They look at what they plan to drill. And gas GORs, the decline over time, oil declines faster than natural gas does. So that impacts the long-term outlook in this regard. Jim wanted to know, does that mean you have less crude? And I think there's a misconception, thanks for that, Jim, that we don't have the amount of crude that we had before because of GORs. And that absolutely is not the fact. And you can look at our forecasts, which we stand by. You have a lot of both. That's the bottom line. You have a lot of crude. There's been no change in those curves as we forecast. You have a lot of very rich gas. So the answer is it doesn't mean less crude. And ultimately, this is not a bad story. It's not a bad story for Enterprise. It's a great story. Completely agree. Phenomenal prices. Definitely an outlier. And that's because the utilities just want to prepare and say we have to have the gas."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Libby Strait, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nLibby Strait: Good morning and welcome to the Enterprise Product Partners' conference call to discuss third quarter 2024 earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise's General Partner, Jim Teague; and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. With that, I will turn it over to Jim.\nJim Teague: Thank you, Libby. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 billion for the third quarter compared to $2.3 billion for last year third quarter. We generated $2 billion of distributable cash flow, providing 1.7x coverage. In addition, we retained $808 million of DCP -- DCF. Our retained DCF totals $2.3 billion year-to-date. Operationally, we set 5 volumetric records, including 7.5 billion cubic feet per day of inlet natural gas processing volumes and 12.8 million barrels a day of crude oil equivalent pipeline volumes. We've benefited from contributions from the 3 new natural gas processing plants and wide natural gas price spreads between Waha and other market hubs. We're on track to complete construction of two additional processing plants in the Permian, our Bahia pipeline, frac 14, Phase 1 of our Neches River NGL export terminal, and the last phase of our Morgan\u2019s Point Terminal Flex Expansion in 2025. And we'll have one additional process plant coming online into Delaware in 2026. These projects provide visibility to new sources of cash flow for our company and enhance and expand the NGL value chain at the core of our business. We also announced yesterday that we completed the acquisition of Pi\u00f1on Midstream. These assets are highly complementary to our Permian processing footprint by providing treating services to a prolific area of the basin that generally has been infrastructure limited to the lack of sour natural gas treating and acid gas injection capacity. The Pi\u00f1on assets are also a very strategic addition to our NGL value chain that touches everything from the wellhead to the water. I'd be remiss if we didn't recognize the tireless efforts of over 200 of our employees at Mont Belvieu who rolled from our most comprehensive turnaround for the PDH 1 plant right into a turnaround for our PDH 2 plant. Our employees completed these 24/7 turnarounds with extreme diligence and without any lost time accidents. We believe this time and investment will result in higher utilization rates and performance for both of these facilities going forward, and we look forward to their contributions in 2025. We're excited about the number of inbounds that we're getting related to new natural gas demand in Texas from both datacenters and new gas-fired power plants that would be built under the Texas Energy Fund. There are a lot of people talking about exposure to datacenters. It seems that it's a very sexy thing to say, and everybody who has a piece of pipe in Texas is talking it up. The reality is there's a very small list of companies with pipeline and storage assets best positioned to benefit from this build-out, and the Enterprise is one of them. It is difficult to quantify the ultimate demand and timing at this point, not knowing which projects will go forward. That being said, it is one of the most promising signals we've seen in natural gas in a long time, and we're looking forward to serving this new influx of demand. In Enterprise, we take pride in the fact that our organization is not siloed. Everyone is important. We all pull in the same direction every day. The dedication, commitment and creativity of all our employees has always been the key to our success. We always strive to get better. We operate an integrated value chain, providing a wide range of services from the wellhead to the water. Our systems are highly automated and provide us with billions of data points. Each link in that chain presents an opportunity to provide a service, earn a fee, or enhance profitability by enhancing our margins or reducing our costs. Over the last 5 years, we have developed a very talented big data and data science team that works closely with all areas of our company. We're now using big data for everything from predictive maintenance, to market analytics, to asset optimization. One of the many examples is our pipeline controllers now use real-time profit optimizer programs to help determine when and how they run compressors and pumps based on real-time power and fuel cost. Data and the insights it can provide in many respects is the new currency. And our proprietary data will forever be an opportunity for Enterprise. As we sit in the final quarter of '24 and head into '25, our work is not done. Each year presents new opportunities and new headwinds. We built a network of assets and a culture that delivers strong results throughout business cycles, administrations and market conditions. Our company is built for the long run. As always, we have never been more excited for what the future will bring for our company. With that, Randy.\nRandy Fowler: Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Starting with income statement items, net income attributable to common unit holders was $1.4 billion or $0.65 per unit for the third quarter of 2024. This is an 8% increase over the third quarter of 2023. Our adjusted cash flow from operations, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital, increased 4% to $2.1 billion for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $2 billion for the third quarter of last year. We declared a distribution of $0.525 per common unit for the third quarter of 2024, which is a 5% increase over the distribution declared for the third quarter of last year. This distribution will be paid November 14th to common unitholders of record as the close of the business on October 31st. In the third quarter, the partnership purchased approximately 2.6 million common units off the open market for $76 million. Total repurchases for the trailing 12 months were $252 million, or approximately 9.1 million Enterprise common units, bringing total purchases under our buyback program to approximately 1.1 billion. In addition to buybacks, our distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 6.5 million common units on the open market for $181 million during the last 12 months, and this includes 1.6 million common units on the open market for $47 million during the third quarter of 2024. Of note, 48% of our employees participate in the unit purchase plan. At Enterprise, we really do eat our own cooking. For the 12 months ending September 30, 2024, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.5 billion in distributions to limited partners. Combined with the $252 million of common unit repurchases over the same period, our total capital return was $4.8 billion, resulting in a payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations of 56%. We returned roughly $1 billion more than our growth capital expenditures were for the same period. Total capital investments in the third quarter of 2024 were $1.2 billion, which included $1.1 billion for growth capital projects and $129 million of sustaining capital expenditures. Our expected range of growth capital expenditures for 2024 remains unchanged at $3.5 billion to $3.75 billion. We have received overwhelming interest from our producer customers following our recent acquisition of Pi\u00f1on Midstream. As Jim noted, these assets not only enhance our processing footprint, but allow us to attract more acreage in the Delaware Basin. Additionally, yesterday we announced a contract with Oxy to potentially build a CO2 pipeline that would serve the Houston Industrial Corridor. We are updating our 2025 estimated growth capital expenditure range to $3.5 billion to $4 billion to encompass potential growth opportunities in connection with these announcements. Sustaining capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $640 million in 2024, which is higher than our original estimates, primarily due to costs associated with the turnaround of the two PDH facilities. As of September 30, 2024, our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $32.2 billion. Assuming the final maturity of our hybrids, the weighted average life of our portfolio was approximately 19 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.7%, and approximately 98% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $5.6 billion at the end of the quarter. This includes availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash on hand. Our adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 billion for the third quarter and $9.8 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2024. As of that date, our consolidated leverage ratio is 3.0x on a net basis when adjusted for the partial equity treatment of our hybrids and reduced by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand. Our leverage target remains -- our range remains 2.75 to 3.25, and at 3.0x, we're in the middle of that range. Libby with that, we can open it up for questions.\nLibby Strait: Thank you, Randy. Operator, we are ready to open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Theresa Chen of Barclays. Your question, please, Theresa.\nTheresa Chen: Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Jim's comments about the datacenter and power demand theme. Just how do you see enterprise participating in this? And if you have any color details on commercial discussion to date.\nNatalie Gayden: Hi, Teresa, this is Natalie. As Jim said, we've been unindated [ph] with datacenter demand infrastructure players that have likely exceeded the Bcf a day of demand in the next several years. [Indiscernible] tell you a couple of different, for a couple of different reasons, some of them have shared with us that no longer bringing power to datacenters, rather datacenters going to power sources. And as you know, we've got several pipelines in the Dallas, Fort Worth area and San Antonio. And just a couple of facts that I think you are interested in, if you think about it, Dallas area datacenters ranked fourth in power today, but they're second in the most planned power [ph]. And then San Antonio is even more impressive. It's 17th in power, but ninth in most planned power. So if you think about it that way, there's some regions that are probably losing market share to San Antonio and Dallas, and we stand in a good spot to be able to serve those centers.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you. And then related to the recent Pi\u00f1on acquisition, can you provide some details on how you plan to integrate it across your NGL assets and the ability you have to roll out treating services beyond the immediate to midstream acreage and just the long-term value creation you see from these assets, please?\nJim Teague: Natalie, you're still up.\nNatalie Gayden: Yes. I think you can think of it this way. We won't treat Pi\u00f1on any differently than our integrated GMP assets. There won't be many treating deals behind Pi\u00f1on that don't come with processing deals to serve the integrated value chain.\nJim Teague: So it leads to more organic growth through processing.\nNatalie Gayden: Yes.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury of BofA. Your question, please, Jean.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Hi, good morning. Ethane storage is full. There's no new demand until you and ET's export facilities come online next year. Can you kind of talk about how you see this resolving? Do you see a big step down in ethane recovery? Would that change your growth rate the next few quarters, and is there kind of a positive offset to that for Enterprise in your portfolio?\nTug Hanley: Hi, Jean. This is Tug Hanley. Yes, as far as recoveries and rejection, that will balance the market. Regionally, there's other places other than the Permian Basin where the gas base, it doesn't make sense to recover necessarily or further to transport to market. As far as opportunity set for us, it's going to lead to some positive storage opportunities on collecting contango.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay. That makes sense. And then my follow-up is about the TW Product slide. Is this the final state of the TW Products System? I think you said in the release that it's 20,000 barrels a day of truck loading capacity in Utah. Can the pipe do more than that if you add truck loading capacity, or should we think about this as being the end state of the system?\nJustin Kleiderer: Hey, Jean Ann, it's Justin. No, we have more capability to add truck [indiscernible]. In fact, we're doing that right now in our Permian terminal because our terminal is full. So, as we identify additional demand and our demand further up system continues to ramp, we'll look for those deep bottlenecking opportunities to take advantage of it.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Okay, great. Very clear. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis of Citi. Your question, please, Spiro.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to Pi\u00f1on really quickly. Maybe can you just walk us through your decision to buy versus build there. Just curious if that was in any way reflective of some sort of bottleneck on the treating side in the basin.\nJim Teague: I guess I'll start, Natalie. First of all, if we had built Greenfield, we were looking at 3 years, if I'm not mistaken. We've missed some opportunities because we didn't have this service. So we needed the platform, and it was the easiest, quickest way to get it.\nNatalie Gayden: Yes, that's good.\nJim Teague: Does that answer it, Spiro?\nSpiro Dounis: It does. I appreciate that. Second question, just maybe sticking with New Mexico. I guess last week there was some news headlines just around a new setback rule that could come into play. I know this can pop up from time-to-time and it sounds like at least for now there's not much to do around it. But just curious maybe to get your all's view on how you think about the potential impact there if something like that comes into play.\nJim Teague: I don't -- I didn't hear the question, Anthony. Did you \u2026\nNatalie Gayden: Setbacks in New Mexico.\nAnthony Chovanec: Yes, setbacks in New Mexico. I'll speak for myself and then -- yes, I'll speak for myself from a fundamental standpoint and then, Nat, will you address it? I think the industry is very firm and, as I always said, tell us what the rules are and we'll know, we'll figure out how to adjust to them. Natalie, I haven't heard, maybe you have, or have not, anybody say that they're doing anything other than studying these rules. It's certainly from the meetings I've been and it hasn't changed people's plans at this point. I think the other thing to add to that is remember that we drill horizontally laterals that may be at 3 or 4 miles. So I'm confident from a fundamental standpoint that the industry is going to be able to adjust once they know what the rules are. Are you hearing anything different?\nNatalie Gayden: Nothing different. I think it's too early to speculate on what impacts it will have and nothing more than commentary from a few New Mexico producers.\nSpiro Dounis: Great. I appreciate the color. Leave it there. Thanks, team.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your question, please, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nLibby Strait: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to touch base with Tony here on I guess more on the macro outlook and I guess producer-customer conversations as well as what the macro team sees as far as production trends at this point in time, given the volatility we've seen in commodity prices.\nAnthony Chovanec: Yes, this is Tony. I'll start with it. I think as long as we've been publishing forecasts, this is maybe the second or third time that we've actually republished midyear. And that's because what we're seeing both in traditional benches and new targets to gassier benches. When you look at EIA numbers, I'll kind of go ahead and go there. I understand that's a very hard thing to set your watch to, that's not what we use. They're trying to get better at it, but it's -- they're making slow progress. What we said in the Permian Basin, there's been a lot of noise also relative to weather in the Bakken and in the Gulf of Mexico relative to [indiscernible]. So, let's go to what's stable and what's the large thing that moves the number, and that's the Permian Basin. We said that over a 3-year period, just looking at black oil, that we would have about 1.5 million barrels a day of growth over that 3-year period. For 2023, we're at about 750,000 barrels. We think that number for 2024 will be 350,000 to 400,000 barrels and from what we're seeing as far as turn in line from our producers, it's [indiscernible] it's also then -- that number is going to be very heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. So it's not a long put, as a matter of fact, it's what we expect that we will still -- the Permian will meet that goal of probably a 1.5 million barrels in 2025. That said, you can look at our forecast and the one thing that is changing, and likely to change, is the commitments that producers are making to gassier basins. And Natalie, I'll let you take it from there.\nNatalie Gayden: I agree. I think we often, we see it in our production plans from our producers. And they either, PDP isn't coming off as expected, or let's just say some of the B plans are holding a little bit longer. But definitely gassier, even if they're on the order of 10%, sometimes they miss it by that order of magnitude, we see it time and time again. Not large numbers, but definitely something to keep up with.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. Thank you for that. And maybe shifting gears a little bit here with Bahia. It looks like the timeline shifted a little bit there, so just wondering if you could update us on project development there and also just our current thoughts on Permian NGL pipeline egress. How do you see that shift?\nJustin Kleiderer: Hey Jeremy, this is a Justin Kleiderer. So just minor delays in our expected timing on permit to construct, causing the delay from the first half into this -- into the third quarter. On the commercial development front, I would say, as you saw in our latest deck, Tony's updated NGL forecast paints a very different picture for overall industry utilization. I think by 2028 now, the updated supply numbers have us upwards of 90% utilized as an industry. So, we're still working the same playbook as we talked about in prior quarters around how we're developing commercially there. But it really just comes down to how that incremental supply gets contracted, whether that be a combination of additional GMP assets that Natalie alluded to earlier, or continuing to pursue third-party NGLs.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum of Wells Fargo. Your line is open, Michael.\nMichael Blum: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about the announcement yesterday on the CO2 pipeline project with Oxy. Once you've just confirmed this is new pipe, you're not repurposing and get a sense for how many miles of pipe are we talking about, and we do expect to get your typical midstream contract structure and typical midstream return on a project like this.\nRobert Sanders: Good morning, Michael. This is Bob Sanders. The contract with 1.5 is a fairly straightforward transportation agreement. When 1.5 goes to FID, they will tell us what emitters to connect to so we know what to design for. It is new pipe because it is ANSI 900 pipe. It's a high-pressure pipeline system. We expect 1.5 to FID sometime in the first half of 2025, and at that point, we'll know what the capital is, and the fee will be set accordingly.\nMichael Blum: Great. Great. Thanks for that. And then I just wanted to ask about LPG export dock spot rate dynamics. I guess the rates have increased in recent months. I wanted to get a sense how full of the docks, and your docks specifically from that perspective, are you able to capture any of these higher spot rates or are you basically fully contracted?\nTug Hanley: Yes, this is Tug. So, we've talked about it in a prior earnings call that we did a debottlenecking project at the ship channel, it provided us higher capacity. So, right now we're having anywhere between 2 to 3 spot cargos per month, and we are capturing those higher values, call it mid $0.20 per gallon.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist. Please go ahead, Neil.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning. Thanks for the time. My first question is on your Petrochem specifically. Are you all continuing to expand the ethylene and propylene systems? I'm just wondering, do you guys, do you continue to believe more export capacity will be needed there.\nChristopher D'Anna: Hey, Neal, it's Chris D'Anna. We are continuing to grow, particularly our ethylene pipeline system. So if you remember, that pipeline system didn't exist before 2019. And we've built a pretty substantial system, and we plan to continue to grow that. And then in terms of our exports, we have an expansion underway. It's the -- I don't know, at our Morgan's Point dock, and that'll come online, the first phase of that will be online at the end of this year.\nNeal Dingmann: Chris, perfect. [Indiscernible].\nJim Teague: Talk about real quick what you're seeing in Europe and what you think that creates for us.\nChristopher D'Anna: Yes, I think one of the growth opportunities that we see for ethylene exports in particular is Europe. With the economics that those crackers have, one, they're quite a bit smaller, so they don't have the economies of scale that we have here in the U.S. And then secondly, just the overall feedstock, it's a whole ethane versus naphtha, or natural gas versus crude kind of fundamentals there. So we expect to see, and we've heard from a lot of the chemical companies that they're doing strategic reviews of their European assets. So we expect to see some closures, and we expect that to lead to additional ethylene exports going that way.\nNeal Dingmann: Great details. [Indiscernible]. And then my second is just on marketing specifically. It seems like Waha continues to be quite volatile, so I'm just wondering, based on that, can we assume the marketing business continues to remain strong for you all?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, we have roughly 370 million a day open on that West to East Waha spread, so we do expect that to continue to contribute.\nNeal Dingmann: Great to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research. Your question, please, Keith.\nKeith Stanley: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. First, just curious for an update on commercial conversations on the spot project. I think there was a quote a week or two ago from a conference of, trying to get a first customer to sign up for that project. Just an update on any momentum you're having there.\nJim Teague: You want to take it, Jay?\nJames Bany: Hey, Keith. This is Jay Bany. Yes, just related around commercial conversations, they're quite extensive and in various degrees of conversation, anywhere ranging from we're working through definitive agreements, changing term sheets. I'd say a large portion of our customer base are currently just evaluating the cost inefficiencies related to ship-to-ship transfers and how that affects their business, both their, call it net back as American producer expenses, or ultimately delivered price for international customers. And so we expect to hear some of that feedback here, call it, the end of this quarter, early first quarter.\nKeith Stanley: Thanks for that. Second question, I'm admittedly not sure this is a great answer to this necessarily, but the valuation gap between the C-Corps in the space and the MLPs is at a record high above anything I can recall. Are there any potential ways the company could capitalize on that? I don't know if it's selling assets at higher valuations or other ways to respond to the market seemingly valuing C-Corps much more highly than MLPs these days.\nRandy Fowler: Hey, Keith, this is Randy. I don't think there's any quick solution or answer there. I think coming in and trying to play the game of selling assets at a higher valuation is somewhat short-sighted, especially when you come in and you look at the depreciation recapture that comes and it gets pushed down to all your limited partner. All it becomes is a tax event for your limited partners, and I don't know what actually you've accomplished. So, we've seen 2 or 3 years ago, I think it was near these levels and then we saw the two compressed, but generally when there's this big of a difference in asset classes, normally the market solves it one way or the other.\nKeith Stanley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McKay of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, John.\nJohn McKay: Hey all. Thanks for the time. I just want to maybe do two quick clarifications. First one is, Rand, this is to you, I guess, just on that last comment, is the up-fee idea still out there? Is there any reason you guys have permanently put that to the side at this point?\nRandy Fowler: I appreciate the thought there. Again, I think that's another -- sort of the devil's in the detail there. Number one, now you've got -- you would have two securities outstanding. You need to build liquidity up in that second security. And by the way, then what do you do with use of proceeds? So I think -- and if I come in and look over time, there's not really been and there's been examples whether it's the upseas [ph] or whether it's been the, oh, gee whiz, the [indiscernible] units that were done way back 20 years ago. And you really never saw that much differentiation, whether it was the institute, the [indiscernible] units, the institutional class units of a partnership that was more institutional investor friendly, or whether it was the UPSI and the underlying MLP. So to us, that adds a lot of complexity, and really you don't get that much bang for your buck.\nJohn McKay: That's clear. I appreciate that. Second quick follow-up. I appreciate the comments and all the work done on the PDHs. I just want to clarify, are both up and running fully now? Is this a fourth quarter run rate going forward? Is this a first quarter '25? Then maybe if you could just remind us maybe what those two assets in aggregate could add from an ongoing cash flow basis, that'd be great.\nJim Teague: They're up and running, both of them, running at full rates if not higher. And Chris, I'd say it's in the neighborhood of $200 million.\nChristopher D'Anna: That's right.\nJohn McKay: That's clear. Congrats on getting that done, and thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of AJ O'Donnell of TPH. Your question, please, AJ.\nAJ O'Donnell: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on Matterhorn [ph], with that pipeline now running about a Bcf, or over a Bcf a day. Curious if you guys have seen a jump in flush production into your system in Q4, or if the majority of the pipeline volumes are just flows shifting around the basin or redirected gas.\nJim Teague: I don't think we've seen a flush production yet, have we, Natalie?\nNatalie Gayden: Yes.\nAJ O'Donnell: Okay. Maybe just going back to the capital budget then, just trying to understand on the increase in the '25 budget, I was hoping maybe you could bribe just a little bit of a discolor on the types of the projects you're seeing with Pi\u00f1on. I'm just curious if there's any more of that to potentially be announced in the '25 budget or does that seem a little bit further off?\nJim Teague: I believe you're going to have Pi\u00f1on projects next year.\nNatalie Gayden: Yes. We'll do our job as well.\nJim Teague: Natalie says yes.\nAJ O'Donnell: Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta of UBS. Your question please, Manav.\nManav Gupta: Hi, good morning. You guys did a very good job of explaining some of the 2025 growth projects. Help us understand the product pipeline is pretty strong, whether it's Mentone West 2, or Neches River. How should we think about the key growth projects for 2026 at this stage?\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Manav, thanks for the question. I think we're still at the point where, and we try to point this out in our supplemental slides for earnings, and you come in and you look at the projects that have been FID'd. I want to say that the runoff in 2026, what we have remaining to spend on currently FID projects is probably about $1 billion, $1.2 billion. If you would, in 2026 we have room that we put in there that we think will probably be in the range of $2 billion, maybe it's upward to $2.5 billion, but we have room for development of other growth-oriented projects between now and then. And that's where we think 2024 and 2025 is really a period of elevated CapEx, and that will come back in more on a longer term basis. See that come back down to around 2, 2.5.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. Thank you.\nRandy Fowler: And you saw this, and again, I'll come back in, I'm sorry. You sort of saw the same thing in 2018, 2019. In those years, we were about $4 billion in growth CapEx, and again, those had some large projects and some step changes in capacity. And then you saw our growth CapEx moderate back down, and we think the same thing will happen once you get out to 2026.\nManav Gupta: Perfect. My quick follow-up is there was a little bit of a step-up in buybacks in 3Q versus 2Q. Again, as you're going through this build-out, how should we think about shareholder returns for the rest of 2024 or even 2025?\nRandy Fowler: I think, again, with 2024 and 2025 CapEx being at elevated levels, you'll probably continue to see buybacks in that $200 million, $300 million range. I think once we get out to 2026, we'll need to reassess what the opportunities are at that time, and we'll go from there.\nManav Gupta: Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Libby Strait for closing remarks. Madam?\nLibby Strait: Thank you, and thank you to our participants for joining us today. That concludes our remarks. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

It's the -- I don't know, at our Morgan's Point dock, and that'll come online, the first phase of that will be online at the end of this year.

So, we've talked about it in a prior earnings call that we did a debottlenecking project at the ship channel, it provided us higher capacity.

            "content": "Thank you, Libby. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 billion for the third quarter compared to $2.3 billion for last year third quarter. We generated $2 billion of distributable cash flow, providing 1.7x coverage. In addition, we retained $808 million of DCP -- DCF. Our retained DCF totals $2.3 billion year-to-date. Operationally, we set 5 volumetric records, including 7.5 billion cubic feet per day of inlet natural gas processing volumes and 12.8 million barrels a day of crude oil equivalent pipeline volumes. We've benefited from contributions from the 3 new natural gas processing plants and wide natural gas price spreads between Waha and other market hubs. We're on track to complete construction of two additional processing plants in the Permian, our Bahia pipeline, frac 14, Phase 1 of our Neches River NGL export terminal, and the last phase of our Morgan's Point Terminal Flex Expansion in 2025. And we'll have one additional process plant coming online into Delaware in 2026. These projects provide visibility to new sources of cash flow for our company and enhance and expand the NGL value chain at the core of our business. We also announced yesterday that we completed the acquisition of Pin\u0303on Midstream. These assets are highly complementary to our Permian processing footprint by providing treating services to a prolific area of the basin that generally has been infrastructure limited to the lack of sour natural gas treating and acid gas injection capacity. The Pin\u0303on assets are also a very strategic addition to our NGL value chain that touches everything from the wellhead to the water. I'd be remiss if we didn't recognize the tireless efforts of over 200 of our employees at Mont Belvieu who rolled from our most comprehensive turnaround for the PDH 1 plant right into a turnaround for our PDH 2 plant. Our employees completed these 24/7 turnarounds with extreme diligence and without any lost time accidents. We believe this time and investment will result in higher utilization rates and performance for both of these facilities going forward, and we look forward to their contributions in 2025. We're excited about the number of inbounds that we're getting related to new natural gas demand in Texas from both datacenters and new gas-fired power plants that would be built under the Texas Energy Fund. There are a lot of people talking about exposure to datacenters. It seems that it's a very sexy thing to say, and everybody who has a piece of pipe in Texas is talking it up. The reality is there's a very small list of companies with pipeline and storage assets best positioned to benefit from this build-out, and the Enterprise is one of them. It is difficult to quantify the ultimate demand and timing at this point, not knowing which projects will go forward. That being said, it is one of the most promising signals we've seen in natural gas in a long time, and we're looking forward to serving this new influx of demand. In Enterprise, we take pride in the fact that our organization is not siloed. Everyone is important. We all pull in the same direction every day. The dedication, commitment and creativity of all our employees has always been the key to our success. We always strive to get better. We operate an integrated value chain, providing a wide range of services from the wellhead to the water. Our systems are highly automated and provide us with billions of data points. Each link in that chain presents an opportunity to provide a service, earn a fee, or enhance profitability by enhancing our margins or reducing our costs. Over the last 5 years, we have developed a very talented big data and data science team that works closely with all areas of our company. We're now using big data for everything from predictive maintenance, to market analytics, to asset optimization. One of the many examples is our pipeline controllers now use real-time profit optimizer programs to help determine when and how they run compressors and pumps based on real-time power and fuel cost. Data and the insights it can provide in many respects is the new currency. And our proprietary data will forever be an opportunity for Enterprise. As we sit in the final quarter of '24 and head into '25, our work is not done. Each year presents new opportunities and new headwinds. We built a network of assets and a culture that delivers strong results throughout business cycles, administrations and market conditions. Our company is built for the long run. As always, we have never been more excited for what the future will bring for our company. With that, Randy. Natalie, you're still up. So it leads to more organic growth through processing. I guess I'll start, Natalie. First of all, if we had built Greenfield, we were looking at 3 years, if I'm not mistaken. We've missed some opportunities because we didn't have this service. So we needed the platform, and it was the easiest, quickest way to get it. Does that answer it, Spiro? I don't -- I didn't hear the question, Anthony. Did you ... Talk about real quick what you're seeing in Europe and what you think that creates for us. You want to take it, Jay? They're up and running, both of them, running at full rates if not higher. And Chris, I'd say it's in the neighborhood of $200 million. I don't think we've seen a flush production yet, have we, Natalie? I believe you're going to have Pin\u0303on projects next year. Natalie says yes."

As Jim said, we've been unindated [ph] with datacenter demand infrastructure players that have likely exceeded the Bcf a day of demand in the next several years. [Indiscernible] tell you a couple of different, for a couple of different reasons, some of them have shared with us that no longer bringing power to datacenters, rather datacenters going to power sources. And as you know, we've got several pipelines in the Dallas, Fort Worth area and San Antonio. And just a couple of facts that I think you are interested in, if you think about it, Dallas area datacenters ranked fourth in power today, but they're second in the most planned power [ph]. And then San Antonio is even more impressive. It's 17th in power, but ninth in most planned power. So if you think about it that way, there's some regions that are probably losing market share to San Antonio and Dallas, and we stand in a good spot to be able to serve those centers. Yes. I think you can think of it this way. We won't treat Pin\u0303on any differently than our integrated GMP assets. There won't be many treating deals behind Pin\u0303on that don't come with processing deals to serve the integrated value chain. Yes. Yes, that's good. Setbacks in New Mexico. Nothing different. I think it's too early to speculate on what impacts it will have and nothing more than commentary from a few New Mexico producers. I agree. I think we often, we see it in our production plans from our producers. And they either, PDP isn't coming off as expected, or let's just say some of the B plans are holding a little bit longer. But definitely gassier, even if they're on the order of 10%, sometimes they miss it by that order of magnitude, we see it time and time again. Not large numbers, but definitely something to keep up with. Yes. Yes. We'll do our job as well."

Starting with income statement items, net income attributable to common unit holders was $1.4 billion or $0.65 per unit for the third quarter of 2024. This is an 8% increase over the third quarter of 2023. Our adjusted cash flow from operations, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital, increased 4% to $2.1 billion for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $2 billion for the third quarter of last year. We declared a distribution of $0.525 per common unit for the third quarter of 2024, which is a 5% increase over the distribution declared for the third quarter of last year. This distribution will be paid November 14th to common unitholders of record as the close of the business on October 31st. In the third quarter, the partnership purchased approximately 2.6 million common units off the open market for $76 million. Total repurchases for the trailing 12 months were $252 million, or approximately 9.1 million Enterprise common units, bringing total purchases under our buyback program to approximately 1.1 billion. In addition to buybacks, our distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 6.5 million common units on the open market for $181 million during the last 12 months, and this includes 1.6 million common units on the open market for $47 million during the third quarter of 2024. Of note, 48% of our employees participate in the unit purchase plan. At Enterprise, we really do eat our own cooking. For the 12 months ending September 30, 2024, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.5 billion in distributions to limited partners. Combined with the $252 million of common unit repurchases over the same period, our total capital return was $4.8 billion, resulting in a payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations of 56%. We returned roughly $1 billion more than our growth capital expenditures were for the same period. Total capital investments in the third quarter of 2024 were $1.2 billion, which included $1.1 billion for growth capital projects and $129 million of sustaining capital expenditures. Our expected range of growth capital expenditures for 2024 remains unchanged at $3.5 billion to $3.75 billion. We have received overwhelming interest from our producer customers following our recent acquisition of Pin\u0303on Midstream. As Jim noted, these assets not only enhance our processing footprint, but allow us to attract more acreage in the Delaware Basin. Additionally, yesterday we announced a contract with Oxy to potentially build a CO2 pipeline that would serve the Houston Industrial Corridor. We are updating our 2025 estimated growth capital expenditure range to $3.5 billion to $4 billion to encompass potential growth opportunities in connection with these announcements. Sustaining capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $640 million in 2024, which is higher than our original estimates, primarily due to costs associated with the turnaround of the two PDH facilities. As of September 30, 2024, our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $32.2 billion. Assuming the final maturity of our hybrids, the weighted average life of our portfolio was approximately 19 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.7%, and approximately 98% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $5.6 billion at the end of the quarter. This includes availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash on hand. Our adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 billion for the third quarter and $9.8 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2024. As of that date, our consolidated leverage ratio is 3.0x on a net basis when adjusted for the partial equity treatment of our hybrids and reduced by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand. Our leverage target remains -- our range remains 2.75 to 3.25, and at 3.0x, we're in the middle of that range. Libby with that, we can open it up for questions. Yes, we have roughly 370 million a day open on that West to East Waha spread, so we do expect that to continue to contribute. Hey, Keith, this is Randy.

I think the industry is very firm and, as I always said, tell us what the rules are and we'll know, we'll figure out how to adjust to them. Natalie, I haven't heard, maybe you have, or have not, anybody say that they're doing anything other than studying these rules. It's certainly from the meetings I've been and it hasn't changed people's plans at this point. I think the other thing to add to that is remember that we drill horizontally laterals that may be at 3 or 4 miles. So I'm confident from a fundamental standpoint that the industry is going to be able to adjust once they know what the rules are. Are you hearing anything different? Yes, this is Tony. I'll start with it. I think as long as we've been publishing forecasts, this is maybe the second or third time that we've actually republished midyear. And that's because what we're seeing both in traditional benches and new targets to gassier benches. When you look at EIA numbers, I'll kind of go ahead and go there. I understand that's a very hard thing to set your watch to, that's not what we use. They're trying to get better at it, but it's -- they're making slow progress. What we said in the Permian Basin, there's been a lot of noise also relative to weather in the Bakken and in the Gulf of Mexico relative to [indiscernible]. So, let's go to what's stable and what's the large thing that moves the number, and that's the Permian Basin. We said that over a 3-year period, just looking at black oil, that we would have about 1.5 million barrels a day of growth over that 3-year period. For 2023, we're at about 750,000 barrels. We think that number for 2024 will be 350,000 to 400,000 barrels and from what we're seeing as far as turn in line from our producers, it's [indiscernible] it's also then -- that number is going to be very heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. So it's not a long put, as a matter of fact, it's what we expect that we will still -- the Permian will meet that goal of probably a 1.5 million barrels in 2025. That said, you can look at our forecast and the one thing that is changing, and likely to change, is the commitments that producers are making to gassier basins. And Natalie, I'll let you take it from there."

We reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion in the same quarter last year. We generated $1.8 billion of distributable cash flow. We had 1.6 times coverage for the quarter. We retained $661 million of DCF in the second quarter, and we're at $1.5 billion year-to-date. Even though the second quarter can be seasonally our weakest quarter, our company handled a near record 12.6 million barrels per day of crude oil equivalent volumes and 2.2 million barrels a day of marine terminal volumes as well as record natural gas processing and record NGL pipeline and fractionation volumes. Our investments to support growth in the Permian Basin are visible, both volumetrically and financially in our NGL Pipeline and Services segment, which reported a 19% increase in gross operating margin compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily attributable to our four new natural gas processing plants in the Permian and our 12th NGL fractionator at our Mont Belvieu area complex. In addition, we also benefited from improvements in natural gas processing margins compared to last year. Our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment also reported a 23% increase in gross operating margin compared to the same quarter in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher transportation revenues and higher marketing margins, associated with the wider spreads between op and higher valued market hubs. We had a very good quarter in spite of the challenges of our PDH plants. They have been somewhat of a headwind throughout the year. We recently completed our turnaround at PDH 1. Planning for the turnaround took over a year and involved a dedicated turnaround team in addition to field engineering and maintenance personnel. This team documented every issue we've had with this plant and developed solutions for each one. The turnaround took 100 days. A few factoids, turnaround was over 1.25 million hours worked. At the peak, we had 1,250 people per shift. We had 590 work packages executed, 17 million pounds of catalysts handled 1,465 crane lifts, 190 18-wheeler deliveries, 52,800 bricks and inspected over 41,000 replaced. Those bricks are the catalyst support and the catalyst reactor. The plan is now up and running and exceeding its nameplate. PDH 2 is currently in turnaround. We expect it to be producing PGP sometime around mid-August. The PDH 2 turnaround is not nearly as involved as PDH 1. I'd like to thank our Mont Belvieu team and our supporting service providers for their long hours and hard work during these back-to-back turnarounds. We're confident that these two plants will be a tailwind the rest of the year. We also completed our diluent open season on the TE product system. We closed the open season with 100,000 barrels a day of new and reach contracted commitments, and I think those are five-year deals. We then accommodate -- we can accommodate this incremental demand with the suite of debottlenecks and horsepower additions, while ensuring we do not impact our existing customers. Finally, our company has $6.7 billion of projects under construction that provide visibility to future earnings and cash flow growth. These projects include three processing plants, one in the Midland Basin, two in the Delaware and associated gathering. Our Bahia NGL pipeline, frac 14 and export expansions at the Neches River Terminal in the ship channel. All of these projects are backed by long-term contracts and significantly enhance what is already a very strong NGL value chain. And as has been the case for several years running, we continue to see even more rich gas volumes coming from the Permian than we had previously forecasted. And Tony may have something on this in the Q&A. And with that, I'll turn it over to Randy.\nRandy Fowler: All right. Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. Starting with the income statement. Net income attributable to common unitholders was $1.4 billion or $0.64 per unit for the second quarter of 2024. This was a 12% increase over the second quarter of 2023. Our adjusted cash flow from operations, which is cash flow from operating activities on the cash flow statement before changes in working capital, this number increased 11% to $2.1 billion for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $1.9 billion for the second quarter of last year. We declared a distribution of $0.525 per common unit for the second quarter of 2024. This is a 5% increase over the distribution declared for the second quarter last year. The distribution will be paid on August 14th to common unitholders of record as of the close of business tomorrow, July 31st. In the second quarter, the partnership purchased approximately 1.4 million common units of the open market for $40 million. Total purchases for the 12 months ending June 30, 2024, were $176 million or approximately 6.5 million Enterprise common units. And this brings total repurchases under our buyback program to approximately $1 billion or about 50% of the total program amount. In addition to buybacks, our distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 6.3 million common units on the open market for $171 million during the last 12 months, including 1.8 million common units on the open market for $50 million during the second quarter of 2024. For the 12 months ending June 30, 2024, Enterprise paid out $4.4 billion in distributions to limited partners combined with the $176 million of common unit purchases over the same period, Enterprise's payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations was 55%. Total capital investments in the second quarter of 2024 were $1.3 billion, which included $1 billion for growth capital projects and $245 million for sustaining capital expenditures. While our expected growth capital expenditures for 2024 did not change as a result of the LPG export announcement we announced this morning, we did refine the bottom of our range. Our current estimate of growth capital expenditures for 2024 is now in a range of $3.5 billion to $3.75 billion. We continue to expect 2025 growth capital investments to be in the range of $3.25 million to $3.75 billion. 2024 sustaining capital expenditures are elevated due to planned turnarounds for our PDH 1 plant and our iBDH facility and our high-purity isobutylene facility. These turnarounds typically occur every three to four years. We now estimate 2024 sustaining capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million, up from $550 million, primarily due to higher capital costs associated with the turnaround at the PDH-1 facility, which was completed in June. The turnaround at the PDH 2 facility began in late June 2024 and as Jim noted, we anticipate completion in the middle of August. As of June 30, 2024, our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $30.6 billion. Assuming the final maturity date for our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio was approximately 18 years, our weighted average cost of debt was 4.7% and approximately 95% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter, including availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash. Our adjusted EBITDA was $204 million for the second quarter and $9.7 billion for the 12 months ending June 30, 2024. As of June 2024, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.0 times on a net basis when adjusted for the partial equity treatment of our hybrids and reduced by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand. Our leverage target remains 3.0 times, plus or minus 0.25 times. With that, Libby, I think we can open it up for questions.\nLibby Strait: Thank you, Randy. And operator, we are ready to open the call for questions from our participants.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Theresa Chen of Barclays.\nTheresa Chen: Morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe starting with the LPG export. So, on that front, you've executed and announced multiple expansions with another one just today. Can you just help us think about what inning are we in terms of export expansion buildup for the industry? And across your system, how much more brownfield capacity expansion do you have left?\nTug Hanley: Yes. So, the market is obviously calling for additional capacity. We announced that expansion this morning around, call it, 85% and 90% contracted of our existing and expansion capacity. But as far as our brownfield capacity, we have additional opportunities to execute that. This product was using existing infrastructure, concerning our term contracts we're out there as highly rates. And like I said, we have additional brownfield opportunities ahead of us.\nTheresa Chen: Okay. And Brent, if you can just help us think about like from a commercial perspective, what is the going rate for brownfield expansion across your system, maybe on a per gallon or their unit basis? And how does that compare with greenfield expansion if anyone wants to get into this part of NGL value chain right now?\nTug Hanley: Theresa, this is Tug talking, but I won't get into a specific rate, but relative to greenfield, it's significantly more competitive.\nTheresa Chen: Okay. Thank you, Tug. And as a follow-up, do you have an update on the commercialization of spot at this point?\nJim Teague: Yes. This is Jim. I'll take that. Yes, we -- up until now, what we've been marketing is a concept. And since we've gotten our license to construct, we're marketing a real project now. And we've done a heck of a lot of work to determine how competitive we are versus a single lightering and multi-lightering. And if you look at the single lightering, we tracked 563 ships that were single lightering. And out of those 563, we put it into quartiles and we were hands down better than 280 of those and competed very effectively with the first two quartiles. And the multi-lightering, we looked at over 400 million and we beat those hand down across the board. So, if you looked at all the ships we tracked, we track 969 ships and we beat hands down 686 of those ships over that timeframe. So, now we're going to see if the market wants it.\nTheresa Chen: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Blum of Wells Fargo.\nMichael Blum: Thank you. Good morning everyone. So, I just wanted to go back to the LPG export discussion a little bit. I wonder if you can just refresh us on what you're seeing for end market demand as you continue to expand capacity? And I guess I'm particularly interested in if you're seeing a lot of that incremental demand coming from China? Thanks.\nTug Hanley: Yes, this is Tug. So, the demand equation is obviously important to our LPG export expansions. But fundamentally, at the end of the day, the barrel has to clear [ph] to the U.S. and the barrel of price accordingly to do so. With respect to China, right now, our exports stand around 43% going to China, but we're also around, call it, 21% to the Americas and 13% to Europe. So, we're seeing a robust demand across the board.\nJim Teague: Tug is that LPG?\nTug Hanley: That\u2019s LPG.\nJim Teague: What percentage of LPG goes to China?\nTug Hanley: Around 43%.\nJim Teague: Propane, butane?\nTug Hanley: Propane, butane.\nJim Teague: Okay. PDH plans. Okay.\nMichael Blum: Great. No, I appreciate that. And then I just wanted to revisit in the capital allocation discussion around buybacks. I think we all understand at this point that enterprise, your definitely preferred method of returning cash in distribution growth over buybacks. So, I'm wondering if you can just refresh us on the criteria where you decide to allocate capital to buybacks especially given that it seems like you have a pretty nice slate of organic growth opportunities at attractive returns? Thanks.\nRandy Fowler: Yes, Michael, this is Randy. Yes, Mike, what we've been targeting over the last few years, and 2024 is not that different, is probably coming in and doing buybacks in the $200 million range. And what that's done is we do issue equity as a component of compensation. But when you come in and take a look at what we issue in terms of compensation and what we buy back, you'll see over the last four years, there is a decrease in the number of overall units outstanding. So, I think that's our focus. Once we get back out -- this year and next year, again, we're talking this year, growth capital expenditures in the $3.5 billion to $3.75 billion range, growth CapEx. Next year, we're still estimating at $3.25 million to $375 million. That's probably going to keep those buybacks in that $200 million range. Once we get back out to 2026, there, we're thinking growth CapEx could be, call it, around $2.5 billion. Then I think we have more room to return capital. And then I think we really just need to get some visibility on 2026 to see what form that increase in the return of capital would look like as far as distributions and buybacks.\nMichael Blum: Great. Thanks Randy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Hello good morning.\nRandy Fowler: Good morning Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to make sure you could hear me there. Thank you. Just wanted to see, I guess, there's been -- some of your midstream peers out there have been acquiring assets, there's been some bolt-ons. And I just wanted to at your thoughts about Enterprise's role within industry consolidation at this point? And I wanted to see, I guess, any thoughts you could share on that at this point, this is the last major wave of consolidation in midstream?\nRandy Fowler: Okay, Jeremy, I'll take the first crack of that. And from a strategic standpoint, I'll let Jim comment. But I think our -- first and foremost, what we're looking at is returns on capital and what gives us the best returns on capital and growing cash flow per unit because at the end of the day, that's what's going to drive value. And we've taken a look at a number of opportunities, more asset acquisitions than, I would say, public company M&A. But what we've seen thus far is organic growth is providing us good opportunities and good returns on capital -- relatively better returns on capital and in growing cash flow per unit. Obviously, the Navitas deal that we did, that also provided good returns on capital, good cash flow growth. So, that's really where our focus is.\nJim Teague: Yes, strategically, I think we've always said it kind of has to fit what we already have. And we talked about the plants we're building in the Permian. I don't think we're through building plants. So, it's got to be -- the price has got to be right. It's got to fit who we are. And when you build a plant, you can put it where it fits who we are. So, I like the organic side, but we look at everything that comes along from a way of more investment bankers come in here, I think you could say, gray so.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Makes sense there. Just wanted to also, I guess, get your thoughts as it relates to power in Texas overall, we've seen instability in the ERCOT market and other issues out there. I'm just wondering how you feel about that going forward? Could there be room for your own generation or other measures to kind of ensure, I guess, stability?\nGraham Bacon: This is Graham, I'll take that. Yes, certainly, power in Texas can be a challenge and it evolves consistently. We're doing things with our projects to basically do some hedging of that through purchase of power generation and looking at other options. We work very closely with the power providers and their status and evaluate whether grid power will be acceptable or we need to have other -- either backup power or we need to have other power sources available. And each situation is different. Every provider is different, whether you're working out in the West Texas or East Texas. So, each situation is individual.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, makes sense. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson of Scotiabank.\nTristan Richardson: Hi, good morning guys. Just on Bahia, can you give a general update on progress there, maybe how you see utilization ramping as that project comes on? And then maybe just your updated thoughts on a base case for Seminole, based on what you're seeing on the supply growth side?\nJustin Kleiderer: Yes, Tristan, this is Justin Kleiderer. I mean I think updates on Bahia, we're still on track from a timing perspective. From a commercial perspective, I think go back a couple of quarters from what -- how we sort of talked strategically about it, and that is -- it's -- the growth is underpinned by our G&P platform, which Jim just spoke to the fact that we don't think we're done building plants. So, Bahia be there to catch those volumes. And then when you think about NGL pipelines, you have to also understand the totality of the system that feeds them. And which we have a premier system with all the connectivity to every -- a majority of the third-party plants that have supply that can feed the system as well. So, you really have to look at plant connectivity to really understand what capacity and utilization could look like. And then third, we always have the sort of optionality that all of our pipelines give us in terms of potential conversions and things like that. So, with respect to Seminole, I think it's a prime candidate for repurposing. I think we've been public with that, in which case, if that happens, then those NGLs will feed into Bahia.\nTristan Richardson: Great. Thank you. And then maybe just a clarification question, sorry if I missed this. But could you talk about the EHT expansion announced this morning and the 300,000 today versus maybe what you had talked about previously in that capital side for EHT, I think you guys referred to it as facility upgrades versus an outright expansion. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the distinction there?\nTug Hanley: I mean it's -- so we're adding an additional refrigeration unit there, expanding the existing dock infrastructure -- utilize an existing doctor and pipeline infrastructure that's ultimately going to 300,000 barrels a day.\nRandy Fowler: This is the original project that was on there was more of a flexibility project between different commodities, which this new train ends up providing.\nTristan Richardson: Great. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis of Citi.\nSpiro Dounis: Thanks operator. Hi team. First question is just on CapEx, but really kind of want to focus on what's uncommitted at this point. Obviously, spot is a big one, and you mentioned a few times now, the potential for more processing plants get built. But as you think about the rest of the system, you've obviously got plenty of pipeline, plenty of export expansion, obviously, some fracs in there. Curious if you could give us a sense of what you think is still missing from that system or maybe areas where customers are coming to you like with this export expansion and demanding more?\nJim Teague: Yes, I remember Dan [ph] one -time, this is Jim, told me we were looking at something and he said, this might be the last deal, Jim. And they keep coming at us. I think we are doing a pretty good job of expanding our primary petrochemical product system, meaning our ethylene system and our propylene system. And I think we'll be surprised in the years to come, how good we'll do in that. And I mean I don't think we have enough export capability based on what I see coming at us in the future. We believe that that rich gas out of the Permian is going to be a couple 3 Bcf a day more than we have forecasted in the past. So, we're on that export train.\nSpiro Dounis: Got you. I guess that does tie to my second question a bit. But just thinking about producers here, curious maybe just one for Tony on how you're thinking about the outlook or what happens next? But curious if you've seen any change in behavior. Obviously, seeing gas kind of turn over here a little bit again, and crude for us has kind of come off the highs. So, are producers acting differently yet? Just curious how you're seeing maybe in the next, call it, medium term? A - Anthony Chovanec\nAnthony Chovanec: Sure, this is Tony. Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks -- I guess first of all, we don't see significant changes in producers. In other words, there is a lot of money on the tables for producers to continue to produce because of price of oil and how profitable they are and frankly, they get more profitable every game. So, while certainly, none of them can like very weak prices at Waha, that doesn't keep them from putting barrels on the table. Jim in his remarks mentioned that rich gas continues the trend of exceeding both ours and producers' expectations. What I'd like to add to that is with Natalie's team, we spend a lot of time with commercial people, producers, and technical people and those meetings with producers, we're definitely discussing incremental rich gas over and above, frankly, the type curves that we have in our forecast. I think there's a number of reasons for this, but to boil it down, I think it boils down to some of the richer gas here, benches now being drilled and planned by producers, especially in the Delaware Basin. Plus some of the GOR increases that we're predicting, driven by the multi-bench completion methods, whatever you want to call them, that continue to evolve. When we talked about that in our analysts, Natalie always reminds me that we want to be directionally correct in our forecast, no forecast is correct. But without talking to you all about what we're seeing, again, in these commercial and technical meetings, I think our -- from directionally correct, I think we'd be lacking. Jim, I think you mentioned into three incremental Bs. I would say that's over and above the approximately 30 B of rich gas at 2030 that we had in our forecast. When you look at a basin producing that much cash, you think, well, that's not really a big number. But when you consider the fact that it's liquid-rich and as rich as it is, it gets to be a pretty big number pretty quick. So, that's the reality of what we're dealing with. Anybody else want to add anything? Natalie, you agree?\nNatalie Gayden: Yes. The only thing I'd add is when you think about that much incremental rich gas and more efficient plants in the basin that are capable of extracting higher ethane than before, it becomes a very quick NGL growth number also. So, one thing that I think has surprised people to the upside is the NGL production out of the basin price is said to do it. So, the capability of the plant and the portfolio of processing plants now there in the Permian just is much greater than passed.\nSpiro Dounis: Got it. I'll leave it there. Thanks as always.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley of Wolfe Research.\nKeith Stanley: Hi, good morning. Following up on the Houston LPG export project. Is this a sign that you're perhaps seeing more demand for Phase 2 at the Neches River project to be all ethane instead of a mix of ethane and propane? And so you have to do the Houston project to accommodate the propane side. And then can you just give an update on how much of the Neches River capacity is contracted at this point on both phases?\nTug Hanley: Sure. This is Tug. So, you're exactly right. It will maintain the flexibility of the Neches River facility to do LPG. However, as the VLEC order book continues to get delivered out between now and, call it, into 2026, that facility will be in ethane service long-term. As far as the contract level we have on that facility, it is 100% contracted. I will tell you we have additional debottlenecking projects that we can execute fairly capital efficient to get additional capacity there if the market asks for it. We're in good discussions around that capacity right now and we'll evaluate if we proceed with that. So, yes, I could see it being ethane long-term. What's the second question?\nKeith Stanley: Great. Thank you. And second question, any -- kind of, a technical one, but just any ability for the company to benefit from the wide isobutane to butane spreads that we've seen? Or is the focus really still just MTBE to butane?\nJim Teague: We benefit from that spread.\nKeith Stanley: From the isobutane to butane?\nJim Teague: Yes.\nKeith Stanley: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McKay of Goldman Sachs.\nJohn McKay: Hey everyone, good morning. Thanks for the time. I want to go back to, I think, maybe it was Michael's question on China. We're seeing, at least, oil demand kind of trending decently below expectations right now. I guess I'd just be curious to hear from your perspective, kind of, where demand is trending overall versus your forecast, your expectations on maybe when that could start to pick up? And maybe just how sensitive your outlook could be to that global demand picture, acknowledging the high contracting level? Thanks.\nTug Hanley: I'll -- this is Tug, I'll pass it over to Tony. But as far as enterprises exports to China at around 43%, U.S. is around 52%. So, we're a little bit lower than the U.S. average. I will add that our product does go to China. It's all indirect. So, we don't have any direct contract exposure per se on the LPG side. But we are seeing it ramp up quarter-over-quarter. And then Tony, I'll--\nAnthony Chovanec: Yes. If you talk about other liquids demand and Tug is referencing the barrels going to China, that's -- we all know we've been watching the build-out of PDHs in China for the last three years, and it's nothing short of eye-popping. They dominate the olefins market in Asia at this point, especially relative to PDH activity. So, it's really important in the equation. If you're also referring to oil demand, I would tell you from our view, there's nothing wrong with oil demand globally. Probably on track to be growth somewhere between 1.2 million to 1.4 million barrels a day year-on-year. That's not a bad number, especially with China demand and somewhat weak economies. So, I think other forecasters will tell you the same that that's about the trajectory we're on.\nJim Teague: And this is Jim. I don't think we could undersell the benefits that LPG has with places like Africa and India as a transition fuel from wood and coal. And what we're seeing is that's a lot stickier demand and it doesn't go away.\nAnthony Chovanec: In that regard, for those of you who want to search the Internet for Total Energy's recent commercial that they have been running specifically on LPG in Africa. It's a pretty moving commercial.\nJohn McKay: I appreciate all that. Thanks. I might push for just one more. I mean, looking ahead to November, tariffs are obviously front of mind. Are those coming up in your commercialization discussions either around kind of incremental NGL sales or maybe on spot?\nTug Hanley: Say the question again? I'm sorry.\nJim Teague: Tariffs, export tariffs.\nJohn McKay: We're talking about the risk of incremental tariffs starting next year if that's the impact of commercialization.\nTug Hanley: It gets brought up occasionally, but I'll tell you the truth. If you were to ask me that question two or three years ago, four years ago, especially is at the later days when Trump was in Office, it was brought up quite often. We've been over to Asia a couple of times this year. Those questions and those conversations don't happen near the frequency that they once did.\nJim Teague: What does happen after the LNG, it cannot depend on the U.S., aren\u2019t you getting some of that?\nTug Hanley: Yes, I mean I think people question in terms of what projects are real and if we're going to continue to expand the export capabilities of this country. So, I think, obviously, the people that have contracts in place at the incumbent assets, I think, benefit. But in terms of trying to expand anything that they have, especially over in Asia, I think that makes some pause if they can continue to grow and depend on the U.S. But the tariff side, I'll just expand on that. On the tariff side, I think we fundamentally believe that if the U.S. product has a price to export, then ultimately, the U.S. price has to overcome that tariff based on just pure geography and the transit that they have to incur. So, I mean that's probably more of a reflection of what the U.S. -- what happens to the U.S. price.\nJohn McKay: That's very clear. I appreciate all the thoughts today. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist.\nNeal Dingmann: Morning all. Thanks for the time. My first question, just -- I always appreciate that capital project slide, I'm just wondering something you mentioned earlier kind of got my attention. I just wondered, is it fair to say you won't spend future CapEx until it's largely contracted? Or maybe say in another way, wondering if you have an amount that needs to be contracted or percent of volumes that need to be contracted before FID or CapEx spend.\nJim Teague: It kind of depends on the project. If you want to know the truth on PDH, we wanted to make sure we had every bit of that contracted and turned into an annuity. If we see a lot of upside, we'll probably take less of a contract needs because we see upside on the assets. So, it really depends on the asset. For example, on spot, I'm not going to tell you what it is. We know what we have to have contracted in order to build it.\nNeal Dingmann: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks Jim. And then just one follow-up. Quarter-to-date, the marketing margins continue to look quite strong. And I'm just wondering with about a third of the -- third quarter now in the books, and Waha prices remaining still quite volatile. I think we're anything from $1.50 to negative $2. Just any update you would give on that marketing margins? Thank you.\nBrent Secrest: Yes, this is Brent. So, from Enterprise's perspective, our number is still the same. We have about $380 million a day of exposure. We've hedged a small amount for the balance of this year. But by and large, we still have a lot of exposure to all gas markets that originate from Waha.\nNeal Dingmann: Perfect. Thanks Brent.\nBrent Secrest: Yes, sir.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta of UBS.\nManav Gupta: Hi, this is Manav from UBS. My first question is, can we talk a little bit about the CapEx creep that happened in 2024? What were the drivers of this? And could this repeat in 2025, do you have confidence that this will not happen in 2025?\nRandy Fowler: I think we would come in and say we really didn't see CapEx creep in 2024. We did modify the range. That's why we gave you -- gave the market an upper range. So, the lower part of the range change, but the upper part of the range is still $3.75 billion. And where we sit currently, we're still -- 2025, we still feel good about a range of 3.25% to 3.75%.\nManav Gupta: Okay. And in terms of PDH 2, you get it up in August, so should we assume it runs like that full rates by September? Or do you think it's more of like you get to the full rate in the fourth quarter?\nJim Teague: I'm looking at Graham, and I'm expecting to run at full rates. We should be at full rates in September.\nManav Gupta: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. As there are no further questions in queue, I would now like to turn the conference back to Libby Strait for closing remarks. Madam?\nLibby Strait: Thank you to our participants for joining us today. That concludes our remarks. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Theresa, this is Tug talking, but I won't get into a specific rate, but relative to greenfield, it's significantly more competitive. Yes, this is Tug. So, the demand equation is obviously important to our LPG export expansions. But fundamentally, at the end of the day, the barrel has to clear [ph] to the U.S. and the barrel of price accordingly to do so. With respect to China, right now, our exports stand around 43% going to China, but we're also around, call it, 21% to the Americas and 13% to Europe. So, we're seeing a robust demand across the board. That's LPG. Around 43%. Propane, butane. I mean it's -- so we're adding an additional refrigeration unit there, expanding the existing dock infrastructure -- utilize an existing doctor and pipeline infrastructure that's ultimately going to 300,000 barrels a day. Sure. This is Tug. So, you're exactly right. It will maintain the flexibility of the Neches River facility to do LPG. However, as the VLEC order book continues to get delivered out between now and, call it, into 2026, that facility will be in ethane service long-term. As far as the contract level we have on that facility, it is 100% contracted. I will tell you we have additional debottlenecking projects that we can execute fairly capital efficient to get additional capacity there if the market asks for it. We're in good discussions around that capacity right now and we'll evaluate if we proceed with that. So, yes, I could see it being ethane long-term. What's the second question? I'll -- this is Tug, I'll pass it over to Tony. But as far as enterprises exports to China at around 43%, U.S. is around 52%. So, we're a little bit lower than the U.S. average. I will add that our product does go to China. It's all indirect. So, we don't have any direct contract exposure per se on the LPG side. But we are seeing it ramp up quarter-over-quarter. And then Tony, I'll-- Say the question again? I'm sorry. It gets brought up occasionally, but I'll tell you the truth. If you were to ask me that question two or three years ago, four years ago, especially is at the later days when Trump was in Office, it was brought up quite often. We've been over to Asia a couple of times this year. Those questions and those conversations don't happen near the frequency that they once did. Yes, I mean I think people question in terms of what projects are real and if we're going to continue to expand the export capabilities of this country. So, I think, obviously, the people that have contracts in place at the incumbent assets, I think, benefit. But in terms of trying to expand anything that they have, especially over in Asia, I think that makes some pause if they can continue to grow and depend on the U.S. But the tariff side, I'll just expand on that. On the tariff side, I think we fundamentally believe that if the U.S. product has a price to export, then ultimately, the U.S. price has to overcome that tariff based on just pure geography and the transit that they have to incur. So, I mean that's probably more of a reflection of what the U.S. -- what happens to the U.S. price."

            "name": "Jim Teague",
            "content": "Thank you, Libby. We had another solid quarter, both in terms of volume and cash flow. We reported adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion in the same quarter last year. We generated $1.8 billion of distributable cash flow. We had 1.6 times coverage for the quarter. We retained $661 million of DCF in the second quarter, and we're at $1.5 billion year-to-date. Even though the second quarter can be seasonally our weakest quarter, our company handled a near record 12.6 million barrels per day of crude oil equivalent volumes and 2.2 million barrels a day of marine terminal volumes as well as record natural gas processing and record NGL pipeline and fractionation volumes. Our investments to support growth in the Permian Basin are visible, both volumetrically and financially in our NGL Pipeline and Services segment, which reported a 19% increase in gross operating margin compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily attributable to our four new natural gas processing plants in the Permian and our 12th NGL fractionator at our Mont Belvieu area complex. In addition, we also benefited from improvements in natural gas processing margins compared to last year. Our Natural Gas Pipelines & Services segment also reported a 23% increase in gross operating margin compared to the same quarter in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by higher transportation revenues and higher marketing margins, associated with the wider spreads between op and higher valued market hubs. We had a very good quarter in spite of the challenges of our PDH plants. They have been somewhat of a headwind throughout the year. We recently completed our turnaround at PDH 1. Planning for the turnaround took over a year and involved a dedicated turnaround team in addition to field engineering and maintenance personnel. This team documented every issue we've had with this plant and developed solutions for each one. The turnaround took 100 days. A few factoids, turnaround was over 1.25 million hours worked. At the peak, we had 1,250 people per shift. We had 590 work packages executed, 17 million pounds of catalysts handled 1,465 crane lifts, 190 18-wheeler deliveries, 52,800 bricks and inspected over 41,000 replaced. Those bricks are the catalyst support and the catalyst reactor. The plan is now up and running and exceeding its nameplate. PDH 2 is currently in turnaround. We expect it to be producing PGP sometime around mid-August. The PDH 2 turnaround is not nearly as involved as PDH 1. I'd like to thank our Mont Belvieu team and our supporting service providers for their long hours and hard work during these back-to-back turnarounds. We're confident that these two plants will be a tailwind the rest of the year. We also completed our diluent open season on the TE product system. We closed the open season with 100,000 barrels a day of new and reach contracted commitments, and I think those are five-year deals. We then accommodate -- we can accommodate this incremental demand with the suite of debottlenecks and horsepower additions, while ensuring we do not impact our existing customers. Finally, our company has $6.7 billion of projects under construction that provide visibility to future earnings and cash flow growth. These projects include three processing plants, one in the Midland Basin, two in the Delaware and associated gathering. Our Bahia NGL pipeline, frac 14 and export expansions at the Neches River Terminal in the ship channel. All of these projects are backed by long-term contracts and significantly enhance what is already a very strong NGL value chain. And as has been the case for several years running, we continue to see even more rich gas volumes coming from the Permian than we had previously forecasted. And Tony may have something on this in the Q&A. And with that, I'll turn it over to Randy. Yes. This is Jim. I'll take that. Yes, we -- up until now, what we've been marketing is a concept. And since we've gotten our license to construct, we're marketing a real project now. And we've done a heck of a lot of work to determine how competitive we are versus a single lightering and multi-lightering. And if you look at the single lightering, we tracked 563 ships that were single lightering. And out of those 563, we put it into quartiles and we were hands down better than 280 of those and competed very effectively with the first two quartiles. And the multi-lightering, we looked at over 400 million and we beat those hand down across the board. So, if you looked at all the ships we tracked, we track 969 ships and we beat hands down 686 of those ships over that timeframe. So, now we're going to see if the market wants it. Tug is that LPG? What percentage of LPG goes to China? Propane, butane? Okay. PDH plans. Okay. Yes, strategically, I think we've always said it kind of has to fit what we already have. And we talked about the plants we're building in the Permian. I don't think we're through building plants. So, it's got to be -- the price has got to be right. It's got to fit who we are. And when you build a plant, you can put it where it fits who we are. So, I like the organic side, but we look at everything that comes along from a way of more investment bankers come in here, I think you could say, gray so. Yes, I remember Dan [ph] one -time, this is Jim, told me we were looking at something and he said, this might be the last deal, Jim. And they keep coming at us. I think we are doing a pretty good job of expanding our primary petrochemical product system, meaning our ethylene system and our propylene system. And I think we'll be surprised in the years to come, how good we'll do in that. And I mean I don't think we have enough export capability based on what I see coming at us in the future. We believe that that rich gas out of the Permian is going to be a couple 3 Bcf a day more than we have forecasted in the past. So, we're on that export train. We benefit from that spread. Yes. And this is Jim. I don't think we could undersell the benefits that LPG has with places like Africa and India as a transition fuel from wood and coal. And what we're seeing is that's a lot stickier demand and it doesn't go away. Tariffs, export tariffs. What does happen after the LNG, it cannot depend on the U.S., aren't you getting some of that? It kind of depends on the project. If you want to know the truth on PDH, we wanted to make sure we had every bit of that contracted and turned into an annuity. If we see a lot of upside, we'll probably take less of a contract needs because we see upside on the assets. So, it really depends on the asset. For example, on spot, I'm not going to tell you what it is. We know what we have to have contracted in order to build it. I'm looking at Graham, and I'm expecting to run at full rates. We should be at full rates in September."

            "content": "Yes. The only thing I'd add is when you think about that much incremental rich gas and more efficient plants in the basin that are capable of extracting higher ethane than before, it becomes a very quick NGL growth number also. So, one thing that I think has surprised people to the upside is the NGL production out of the basin price is said to do it. So, the capability of the plant and the portfolio of processing plants now there in the Permian just is much greater than passed."

            "name": "Randy Fowler",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. Starting with the income statement. Net income attributable to common unitholders was $1.4 billion or $0.64 per unit for the second quarter of 2024. This was a 12% increase over the second quarter of 2023. Our adjusted cash flow from operations, which is cash flow from operating activities on the cash flow statement before changes in working capital, this number increased 11% to $2.1 billion for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $1.9 billion for the second quarter of last year. We declared a distribution of $0.525 per common unit for the second quarter of 2024. This is a 5% increase over the distribution declared for the second quarter last year. The distribution will be paid on August 14th to common unitholders of record as of the close of business tomorrow, July 31st. In the second quarter, the partnership purchased approximately 1.4 million common units of the open market for $40 million. Total purchases for the 12 months ending June 30, 2024, were $176 million or approximately 6.5 million Enterprise common units. And this brings total repurchases under our buyback program to approximately $1 billion or about 50% of the total program amount. In addition to buybacks, our distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 6.3 million common units on the open market for $171 million during the last 12 months, including 1.8 million common units on the open market for $50 million during the second quarter of 2024. For the 12 months ending June 30, 2024, Enterprise paid out $4.4 billion in distributions to limited partners combined with the $176 million of common unit purchases over the same period, Enterprise's payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations was 55%. Total capital investments in the second quarter of 2024 were $1.3 billion, which included $1 billion for growth capital projects and $245 million for sustaining capital expenditures. While our expected growth capital expenditures for 2024 did not change as a result of the LPG export announcement we announced this morning, we did refine the bottom of our range. Our current estimate of growth capital expenditures for 2024 is now in a range of $3.5 billion to $3.75 billion. We continue to expect 2025 growth capital investments to be in the range of $3.25 million to $3.75 billion. 2024 sustaining capital expenditures are elevated due to planned turnarounds for our PDH 1 plant and our iBDH facility and our high-purity isobutylene facility. These turnarounds typically occur every three to four years. We now estimate 2024 sustaining capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million, up from $550 million, primarily due to higher capital costs associated with the turnaround at the PDH-1 facility, which was completed in June. The turnaround at the PDH 2 facility began in late June 2024 and as Jim noted, we anticipate completion in the middle of August. As of June 30, 2024, our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $30.6 billion. Assuming the final maturity date for our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio was approximately 18 years, our weighted average cost of debt was 4.7% and approximately 95% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter, including availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash. Our adjusted EBITDA was $204 million for the second quarter and $9.7 billion for the 12 months ending June 30, 2024. As of June 2024, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.0 times on a net basis when adjusted for the partial equity treatment of our hybrids and reduced by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand. Our leverage target remains 3.0 times, plus or minus 0.25 times. With that, Libby, I think we can open it up for questions. Yes, Michael, this is Randy. Yes, Mike, what we've been targeting over the last few years, and 2024 is not that different, is probably coming in and doing buybacks in the $200 million range. And what that's done is we do issue equity as a component of compensation. But when you come in and take a look at what we issue in terms of compensation and what we buy back, you'll see over the last four years, there is a decrease in the number of overall units outstanding. So, I think that's our focus. Once we get back out -- this year and next year, again, we're talking this year, growth capital expenditures in the $3.5 billion to $3.75 billion range, growth CapEx. Next year, we're still estimating at $3.25 million to $375 million. That's probably going to keep those buybacks in that $200 million range. Once we get back out to 2026, there, we're thinking growth CapEx could be, call it, around $2.5 billion. Then I think we have more room to return capital. And then I think we really just need to get some visibility on 2026 to see what form that increase in the return of capital would look like as far as distributions and buybacks. Good morning Jeremy. Okay, Jeremy, I'll take the first crack of that. And from a strategic standpoint, I'll let Jim comment. But I think our -- first and foremost, what we're looking at is returns on capital and what gives us the best returns on capital and growing cash flow per unit because at the end of the day, that's what's going to drive value. And we've taken a look at a number of opportunities, more asset acquisitions than, I would say, public company M&A. But what we've seen thus far is organic growth is providing us good opportunities and good returns on capital -- relatively better returns on capital and in growing cash flow per unit. Obviously, the Navitas deal that we did, that also provided good returns on capital, good cash flow growth. So, that's really where our focus is. This is the original project that was on there was more of a flexibility project between different commodities, which this new train ends up providing. I think we would come in and say we really didn't see CapEx creep in 2024. We did modify the range. That's why we gave you -- gave the market an upper range. So, the lower part of the range change, but the upper part of the range is still $3.75 billion. And where we sit currently, we're still -- 2025, we still feel good about a range of 3.25% to 3.75%."

            "name": "Anthony Chovanec",
            "content": "Sure, this is Tony. Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks -- I guess first of all, we don't see significant changes in producers. In other words, there is a lot of money on the tables for producers to continue to produce because of price of oil and how profitable they are and frankly, they get more profitable every game. So, while certainly, none of them can like very weak prices at Waha, that doesn't keep them from putting barrels on the table. Jim in his remarks mentioned that rich gas continues the trend of exceeding both ours and producers' expectations. What I'd like to add to that is with Natalie's team, we spend a lot of time with commercial people, producers, and technical people and those meetings with producers, we're definitely discussing incremental rich gas over and above, frankly, the type curves that we have in our forecast. I think there's a number of reasons for this, but to boil it down, I think it boils down to some of the richer gas here, benches now being drilled and planned by producers, especially in the Delaware Basin. Plus some of the GOR increases that we're predicting, driven by the multi-bench completion methods, whatever you want to call them, that continue to evolve. When we talked about that in our analysts, Natalie always reminds me that we want to be directionally correct in our forecast, no forecast is correct. But without talking to you all about what we're seeing, again, in these commercial and technical meetings, I think our -- from directionally correct, I think we'd be lacking. Jim, I think you mentioned into three incremental Bs. I would say that's over and above the approximately 30 B of rich gas at 2030 that we had in our forecast. When you look at a basin producing that much cash, you think, well, that's not really a big number. But when you consider the fact that it's liquid-rich and as rich as it is, it gets to be a pretty big number pretty quick. So, that's the reality of what we're dealing with. Anybody else want to add anything? Natalie, you agree? Yes. If you talk about other liquids demand and Tug is referencing the barrels going to China, that's -- we all know we've been watching the build-out of PDHs in China for the last three years, and it's nothing short of eye-popping. They dominate the olefins market in Asia at this point, especially relative to PDH activity. So, it's really important in the equation. If you're also referring to oil demand, I would tell you from our view, there's nothing wrong with oil demand globally. Probably on track to be growth somewhere between 1.2 million to 1.4 million barrels a day year-on-year. That's not a bad number, especially with China demand and somewhat weak economies. So, I think other forecasters will tell you the same that that's about the trajectory we're on. In that regard, for those of you who want to search the Internet for Total Energy's recent commercial that they have been running specifically on LPG in Africa. It's a pretty moving commercial."

[Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Libby Strait Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nLibby Strait: Good morning. Welcome to the Enterprise Products Partners conference call to discuss first quarter 2024 earnings. Our speakers today will be Co-Chief Executive Officers of Enterprise's General Partner, Jim Teague and Randy Fowler. Other members of our senior management team are also in attendance for the call today.  During this call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 based on the beliefs of the company, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to Enterprise's management team. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Please refer to our latest filings with the SEC for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made during this call. And with that, I will turn it over to you Jim. \nA. Teague: Thank you, Libby. We have a war in Europe, favor in the Middle East. We've got student mobs occupying Elite university campuses. -- had a former President being tried for crimes and courts up and down the East Coast, chaos wins. In many ways, what's going on today reminds me of the 1960s. We had a war in Asia called a Vietnam war. We had student antiwar demonstrators occupying campuses throughout the country. And while no President was on trial, one was chased from running for a second term. And on top of all that now, like in 1968, we find that the DNC will hold its convention in Chicago.  For those of you too young to know what that means, I suggest you Google 1968 Chicago convention. But with all this chaos, there is a constant today that should bring calm to investors' concerns in this volatile world. Enterprise continues to deliver -- month after month, quarter after quarter and year after year and first quarter was no exception.  Our total gross operating margin for the quarter -- first quarter was $2.5 billion, a 7% increase compared to the first quarter of last year. Earnings growth for the first quarter was primarily driven by contributions from new assets placed into service during the second half of last year, along with a 17% increase in net marine terminal volumes attributable to continued strength in global demand for U.S. energy and higher sales volumes and margins in our Octane Enhancement business. Our system transported 12.3 million barrels a day of crude oil equivalent, that being NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals, refined products and natural gas. We generated $1.9 billion in DCF during the quarter, providing a 1.7x coverage which supported a 5% increase in cash distributions to partners compared to the same quarter last year. We retained $786 million of DCF. Randy, you're going to get into more color on all this, right? \nRandy Fowler: Right. \nA. Teague: During the quarter, we expanded our Permian natural gas processing infrastructure with the start of our Leonidas plant in the Midland Basin and our Mentone 3 plant in the Delaware Basin. Each of these plants has capacity to process more than 300 million cubic feet a day of natural gas and extract over 40,000 barrels a day of NGLs. We currently have 3 additional 300 million a day plants under construction in the Delaware and 1 in the Midland Basin, along with our Bahia NGL pipeline and Frac 14, which is really our 13th fractionator, but we're not going to call it 13, we call it 14.  Our plants and the systems that support them are essentially pull on the first day of service. With the completion of the 3 processing plants under construction, we will have a total of 19 Permian processing plants capable of producing 675,000 barrels a day of NGLs, beating our NGL systems, including one of the world's largest NGL export capacities.  We also began service on Phase 1 of our Texas Western products pipeline system in March, successfully connecting Gulf Coast refined products to end markets in the Permian Basin, with additional Phase II destinations in the Albuquerque and Grand Junction markets expected in the second and early third quarters.  At the beginning of the month, we received the deepwater port license or a SPOT project. This is one of the most significant milestones to date in the development of SPOT. We put out a press release on April 9 discussing the project and highlighting the accomplishment of the enterprise team that worked tirelessly for over 5 years, tirelessly for over 5 years to obtain the license. I think SPOT's going to be a valuable and highly strategic addition to our asset base as we continue with commercialization.  Last week, the EIA reported that the U.S. exported a record 12.1 million barrels a day of liquids, that being crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids to a world, hungry for our reliable resources that's priced by free market. To put that in perspective, the number was $3.6 million in 2014 and less than $2 million in 2010.  Demand for growing U.S. liquids has been and will continue to be primarily in emerging markets. Enterprise will continue to play a key role. We export around 70 million barrels a month of liquids and have an initiative to reach 100 million barrels a month, which does not include SPOT -- we're a significant player in the export market, and we expect our growth is going to continue to grow. Randy? \nRandy Fowler: Okay. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Starting with first quarter income statement items. Net income attributable to common unitholders for the first quarter of 2024 increased 5% to $1.5 billion or $0.66 per common unit on a fully diluted basis compared to $1.4 billion or $0.63 per common unit for the first quarter of 2023.  Turning to cash flow. Adjusted cash flow from operations, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital increased 6% to $2.1 billion for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $2 billion for the first quarter of last year.  We declared a distribution of $0.515 per common unit for the first quarter of 2024. As Jim mentioned, this is a 5.1% increase over the distribution declared with regard to the first quarter of 2023. The distribution will be paid May 14 to common unitholders of record as of the close of business today.  In the first quarter, the partnership purchased approximately 1.4 million common units of the open market for $40 million, total purchases for the 12 months ending March 31 were $211 million or approximately 8 million enterprise common units, bringing total purchases under our buyback program to approximately $960 million.  In addition to buybacks, our distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 6.5 million common units on the open market for $172 million during the last 12 months, including 1.6 million common units on the open market for $43 million during the first quarter of 2024.  For the 12 months ended March 31, 2024, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.4 billion in distributions to limited partners combined with the $211 million of common unit repurchases across the same time period. Enterprise's payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations was 56% for that 12-month period.  Total capital investments in the first quarter were $1.1 billion, which included $875 million for growth capital projects and $180 million of sustaining CapEx.  We expect growth capital expenditures for 2024 and 2025 to be in the range of $3.25 billion to $3.75 billion. We continue to estimate 2024 sustaining capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million, which includes planned turnarounds at both of our PDH plants our iBDH facility, and high-purity isobutylene facility. As previously mentioned, these scheduled turnarounds typically occur every 3 to 4 years. At this time, we expect the PDH turnaround to be completed in May 2024. We plan to begin addressing the issues on the fourth reactor within PDH 2 in June.  Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $29.7 billion as of March 31, 2024. Assuming the final maturity date for our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio is approximately 19 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.7%.  At March 31, approximately 98% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $4.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, including availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash on hand. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $2.5 billion and $9.5 billion for the trailing 12 months. As of March 31, 2024, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.0x on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and reducing the debt outstanding by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand.  As a reminder, our leverage target remains 3.0x, plus or minus 0.25x. And with that, Libby, I think we can open it up for questions. \nLibby Strait: Thank you. Operator, we are ready to open the call for questions from our participants. If you could please remind them of instructions to ask the questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. \nTheresa Chen: First, congratulations on obtaining the deepwater port license for SPOT. I'm sure that was a labor of love over the past 5 years. Can you provide us an update on the commercialization progress and since you perceived the license earlier this month? And also, can you help us think about how much CapEx would the project require and over what period that would be spent? \nA. Teague: Yes, I'll talk to the CapEx. First of all, it's not what was in the there's article by a long shot, and we typically don't share with people what our CapEx is. I'll turn it over to Brent to answer the other question. \nBrent Secrest: I mean the commercialization, Theresa, is still ongoing, I'd say, for the most part, it's positive. We're spending a lot of time on the road. We expect to have 2 contracts by the end of, call it, next month. And then we're in ongoing discussions with other counterparties to commercialize that. But the mindset is we're not going to move forward on that project until we have the contracts to support that project. \nTheresa Chen: And then turning to your onshore activities. Can you provide an update on the status of the Texas Western products project so far after the initial phase and began service? And what are the key gating factors from here in until Phase I brought online? And what should we look for? \nTug Hanley: Yes. This is Tug Hanley speaking. I'll turn it over to Justin on the future activities. But as current status goes, we have 2 terminals online in West Texas. We just loaded over 50 trucks yesterday. It seems like every single day, we're setting a new record on volumes loaded. And as far as the margins we're getting, those have met our expectations, or they are currently exceeding them. And then you want to talk about just having Justin Kleiderer online? \nJustin Kleiderer: Yes, I'd say Theresa, this is Justin Kleiderer. Just thinking about Phase 2 being Albuquerque and Grand Junction. As Jim had said in his comments, we feel good. We're on the verge of commissioning Albuquerque as we speak. So in the second quarter rolling into early third quarter to get that Phase II seems to be pretty good timing. \nTheresa Chen: Thank you. \nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Tristan Richardson from Scotiabank. \nTristan Richardson: Could you talk about -- a little bit about just the projects you added in the quarter on the Midland side, no new dedications, are these with existing customers? Or are these new customers just primarily in the Delaware versus the Midland? And then should this support plants that are already currently under construction? Or is this gathering projects that could support future new plant sanctions? \nNatalie Gayden: This is Natalie Gayden, -- the new dedications that the gathering expansions in the Delaware and in Midland are supported by new acreage dedication, some existing customers, some new customers. Those gathering expansions feed the new plant that we've built. This morning, I was looking, we're over 91% of our plant capacity full. So a combo of everything. \nTristan Richardson: That's helpful. And then just thinking about on the crude side, you saw seminal move back into NGL service. Just thinking about the crude volumes in the quarter, were you just seeing increased utilization on the existing infrastructure there? Can you talk about maybe the use of DRA to sort of squeeze better utilization out of your existing plants with seminal lines with seminal moving in... \nJames Bany: Yes. Tristan, this is Jay Bany. Yes, I mean, we do a combination and optimization really both for DRA and power. With 2 going out of service, you saw a modest increase in variable cost, but it was near negligible just in the optimization... \nTristan Richardson: Thank you. \nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Spiro Dounis from Citi. \nSpiro Dounis: Maybe if we could just go back to exports. Jim, once you talked about getting to that 100 million barrels a month without SPOT. And I guess I'm just curious if you could just maybe dive into that a little bit more and provide a little bit more color on how you think you can do that. And now with SPOT potentially moving forward, curious where that goal goes from here, especially when you consider the ability to free up some of that LPG capacity as well? \nA. Teague: Spiro, I had a dream one night that we got to 100 million barrels. So I made it an initiative. If you're going to get to 100 million barrels, you're going to get it because you've got a great supply position. So some of the things Natalie is talking about is building your supply position, and we know what it takes to get to that number and what we need to do from a supply perspective. And I don't think -- I don't think Zach, I don't think we have to spend a heck of a lot of money on -- or Jay, on our ship channel or any of our docs in order to handle that my... Bob. \nBob Sanders: Not over what we've already committed to. \nA. Teague: So it's all about supply, Spiro. \nSpiro Dounis: Got it. Appreciate that. Second question, maybe just going to some of the prices we're seeing on Waha. Obviously, a lot of volatility there recently and into the second quarter. It looks like maybe you got some benefit from those negative prices in the first quarter. But I imagine at this rate, second quarter impact could even bigger. Maybe just remind us again some of the exposure you've got there and open capacity to benefit from that. \nTug Hanley: This is Tug Hanley. So it's puts and takes. So from the negative gas price perspective, we are seeing lower prices, obviously, for our equity volumes. However, on the positives of the lower gas price, we're seeing wider margins on C2 to gas, so that's higher KF margins for us. They're over $0.22 a gallon and that means a couple of things for us specifically, higher ethane recoveries across the systems, so we're seeing record pipeline volumes. And then on the gas transport position, we have around 375 million a day that we can participate in, bringing Waha down to the Gulf Coast, which is the premium market versus the Waha negative price. \nSpiro Dounis: Great. I'll leave it there, helpful as always. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. \nKeith Stanley: Just a follow-up on SPOT. So you said you hope to have 2 contracts soon working on others. What's the soonest do you think you can get to an FID kind of a bull case and a base case on that project? Just a sense of how long it could take? \nBrent Secrest: Keith, it's Brent. I think we'd like to target before the end of this year to go forward on that project. \nKeith Stanley: Okay. Okay. Second question. The stock's lagged a bit recently. Your yield plus growth sort of proposition is very high. How are you thinking about the return on stock buybacks versus the returns you get on growth investments? Is that spread narrowing a lot in your eyes or growth projects still a lot more accretive than what you can do with buybacks? \nRandy Fowler: Keith, over the last 3 or 4 years, I mean, the stock prices ebbed and flowed just with the overall volatility in the energy sector in the space. So I mean, it comes and goes. I think we try to keep an all-above approach. And when we see it attractive to do buybacks, we do that. But it's been measured, call it, $200 million, $250 million a year, and I expect it to stay in that area. Our growth CapEx, our projects that were coming in are attractive returns on capital that actually grow our business and serve our customers. So yes, I mean, we take a look at it, but you don't make allocation of capital issue, allocation of capital decisions day by day, depending on where the stock price is. So we've got a longer-term view than that. \nKeith Stanley: Thank you. \nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Zack Van Everen from TPH & Company. \nZackery Van Everen: Sorry on liquids marketing, really propane specifically. We've seen domestic storage and production based on the weekly EA data come in pretty high. I was just curious on your expectations for domestic prices on the propane side? And do you see this widening the spreads to the international markets? And then on that, can you just remind us of the sensitivity and exposure you guys have to that spread? \nTug Hanley: Yes. Tug Hanley speaking. I'll just comment on the international market. So it's -- the barrel here in the U.S. have to price the clear across the water. So we are seeing lower freight prices, which are leading to higher SPOT export opportunities for us. We're seeing some of those opportunities in the low single-digit numbers materialize. So that's been a benefit to us in that aspect. \nBrent Secrest: And I think overall, and Zach, it's Brent. -- propane is going to be constrained here domestically until new export capacity comes online. And so call that next year, you could probably see storage values start widening out because that's the only place could go at this point. I think it's probably good for some of our other assets or our customers around PDH. But once you get out until next year and the years beyond, we think the appetite for LPGs is there across the world. We think freight is going to be there. So at some point in time, it's going to come back to the U.S. producer and for them to catch up to align with the export capacity, the freight and the overall global demand. \nZackery Van Everen: Got it. That makes sense. I appreciate that. And then moving to Wink to Webster. I saw no doubt that you guys might have some downtime at the beginning of Q2. I was curious, one, if you can comment on that and 2, if you can move those volumes to another asset like Midland to L1 and just the overall impact there. \nJames Bany: Yes, Zach, this is Jay. Yes, so we went out this past week to notify our shippers of downtime in June, starting the first. It's estimated around 10 days. And look, until we get actual nominations come in, call it, mid-May, it's kind of hard to figure out how that's going to impact our customer base. \nZackery Van Everen: Perfect fact. All I had... \nOperator: Thank you One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of John Mackay from Goldman Sachs. \nJohn Mackay: I wanted to maybe just stay in the Permian. I'd be curious to get an update from you guys on how activity levels are trending so far this year versus your base case and fully understand that producers are not making decisions based on the gas price. But I would just be curious if you're seeing this weak Waha and kind of gas takeaway issues in the near term affect overall activity levels? \nTony Chovanec: This is Tony. Essentially, you've seen no effect from the weak natural gas prices. If you -- and we show the slide often so that people understand it. If you look at what drives the economics of the producers in the Permian, it's not natural gas. And you're -- what we've seen in natural gas prices is not going to cause people to shut in or even throttle back oil related to natural gas at this point. We haven't seen it. And I guess proof is a little bit in the pudding, if you go and look at -- everybody has different rig counts. But if you go and look at rig counts in the Permian since the first of the year, they're steady as they can be. Actually, same can be said for the Eagle Ford, you see rig counts down in the Haynesville and you see them down some of the Appalachia but not in your oily basins. \nJohn Mackay: All right. That's fair. Maybe just shifting pitches, Octane was pretty strong. Maybe just give us a quick read on how you'd expect that to kind of roll out the rest of the year? And maybe on the other side, where we could expect kind of the PDH contributions to unfold as well. \nF. D'Anna: John, this is Chris D'Anna. On the octane enhancement side, we benefited probably 80% of the improved performance was due to volumes and higher volumes and higher fees. And then we also had a favorable hedge performance. And I guess, looking forward, if you look at the forward curve for normal Bob, it shows pretty steady. So we have, at least for the second quarter, $1.80 spread. And just a reminder for the biggest contributor for octane enhancement is our MTBE, which is made up of normal RBOB and what we call uplift, which is just the market price and really the difference between the normal RBOB spread and the market price. To your second question on PDH, we're expecting when PDH1 and then with the return of PDH2 after our outage in June that both of those assets are contributing back to their full amount. \nOperator: Thank you, one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra from Bank of America. \nIndraneel Mitra: I wanted to ask about the activity within the first quarter. I think it was kind of universally accepted in the Permian that the first quarter would have a little bit of a lag versus the fourth quarter of '23. Just wanted to hear your insights of what you saw in terms of weather activity coming back. And if you could kind of delineate where you're seeing some hotspots in production within the Permian and where you're seeing some lagging versus your initial expectations? \nBrent Secrest: This is Brent. Relative to our first quarter, there was definitely an impact because of weather in the Midland Basin processing side. Our Delaware processing plants held up very well. On the Midland side, we had some downtime and it probably extended gram for 10 days at some point. But that's the reason there's probably an effect on volumes. But to Natalie's point, in terms of what we see as we go forward, and we have a morning supply meeting that you guys are well aware of, it's routine for every day that Natalie comes in to report our processing volumes. That's up every single day. \nIndraneel Mitra: So is it fair to say that there's been a lot of flush production in Keno in the April time frame after the first quarter? \nBrent Secrest: Natalie, I mean we saw the increase, our big jump on our side once our new plants came up. \nNatalie Gayden: Yes. Once our new plants came up, we had some producers that, as you know, don't have acreage dedications rather they just swing from we won market share. So we -- for example, when Minton2 came up, we were immediately full. So I don't know if I'd call it flush production from being down after the winter storm rather than just continue on pace coming back up after the cold weather event. \nIndraneel Mitra: Got it. And if I could sneak one more in there. It seemed like the PGP RGP spreads were especially strong in the first quarter. I was wondering how that contributed to the first quarter results, and if you see that as an ongoing trend for the rest of the year. \nF. D'Anna: Yes, this is Chris again. The RGP/PGP spreads were wide for the first quarter. And you probably saw in the write-up, we had some operational issues on both our PDH and our splitters. So there were some puts and takes there. And again, I think looking forward, we see the contribution from our PDH plants running that that's going to help with our overall margin. \nLibby Strait: Operator, we have time for one more question. \nOperator: Certainly one moment then for our final question. And our final question for today comes from the line of Neil Dingmann from Truist Securities. \nNeal Dingmann: Guys just -- my question is on future capital allocation. I'm just wondering, you all boosted the -- it looks like 2025 CapEx a bit based on opportunities out there. I'm just wondering, do you all have -- when you look at future years, let's just consider 2025 sort of a bogey or level for both shareholder return and projects. Just wondering how we should think about the balance between the 2 as you start looking at 25 and 26. \nRandy Fowler: Yes. Neal, -- what we had talked about at Analyst Day here a few weeks ago was really from a combination of distributions and buybacks sort of operating in that 55% to 60% of adjusted cash flow from operations. We've sort of been in that zone since 2021. And that's sort of what we foresee here for the next few years as well. As far as organic growth CapEx, again, seeing a lot of opportunities in the Permian and also what that -- the downstream benefits that come with that increased supply as it goes through our value chain. And now with getting the license for SPOT, we'll be hustling to come in and get it contracted. So I think we still come back with a bogey of what we put out in 2026, and that's early, is $2 billion, $2.5 billion, of which only $800 million of that is currently approved projects. So we've got some room to fill that up, including coming in and with SPOT. We're successful in getting that underwritten SPOT is really a 3-year construction cycle on that. And so anyway, I think that would help come in and address that $2 billion, $2.5 billion of organic growth CapEx. \nNeal Dingmann: No, that makes sense. And just a quick follow-up. I want to keep it just on the buybacks. Just any your thoughts on, is that sort of this overall just earnings and cash flow keep ramping up. Just thoughts on would you do anything different with the buybacks or how that sort of factors in. \nRandy Fowler: Yes. Neal, I think we'll have more flexibility on buybacks. And again, we look to be opportunistic with it. So I mean, you've seen us do $200 million or $300 million here over the last few years. I mean if there was a market dislocation, we've got the flexibility to do more. And then certainly, here in 2024 and 2025, we're looking at growth CapEx in the $3.25 billion to $3.75 billion range. I think once you get back out to 2026, 2027. And if we're in a more of what I would say, normalized CapEx range, $2 billion, $2.5 billion, then we'll have a lot more flexibility to do buy back then as well. \nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Libby Strait for any further remarks. \nLibby Strait: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. That concludes our remarks. Have a good day. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "A. Teague",
            "content": "Thank you, Libby. We have a war in Europe, favor in the Middle East. We've got student mobs occupying Elite university campuses. -- had a former President being tried for crimes and courts up and down the East Coast, chaos wins. In many ways, what's going on today reminds me of the 1960s. We had a war in Asia called a Vietnam war. We had student antiwar demonstrators occupying campuses throughout the country. And while no President was on trial, one was chased from running for a second term. And on top of all that now, like in 1968, we find that the DNC will hold its convention in Chicago.  For those of you too young to know what that means, I suggest you Google 1968 Chicago convention. But with all this chaos, there is a constant today that should bring calm to investors' concerns in this volatile world. Enterprise continues to deliver -- month after month, quarter after quarter and year after year and first quarter was no exception.  Our total gross operating margin for the quarter -- first quarter was $2.5 billion, a 7% increase compared to the first quarter of last year. Earnings growth for the first quarter was primarily driven by contributions from new assets placed into service during the second half of last year, along with a 17% increase in net marine terminal volumes attributable to continued strength in global demand for U.S. energy and higher sales volumes and margins in our Octane Enhancement business. Our system transported 12.3 million barrels a day of crude oil equivalent, that being NGLs, crude oil, petrochemicals, refined products and natural gas. We generated $1.9 billion in DCF during the quarter, providing a 1.7x coverage which supported a 5% increase in cash distributions to partners compared to the same quarter last year. We retained $786 million of DCF. Randy, you're going to get into more color on all this, right? During the quarter, we expanded our Permian natural gas processing infrastructure with the start of our Leonidas plant in the Midland Basin and our Mentone 3 plant in the Delaware Basin. Each of these plants has capacity to process more than 300 million cubic feet a day of natural gas and extract over 40,000 barrels a day of NGLs. We currently have 3 additional 300 million a day plants under construction in the Delaware and 1 in the Midland Basin, along with our Bahia NGL pipeline and Frac 14, which is really our 13th fractionator, but we're not going to call it 13, we call it 14.  Our plants and the systems that support them are essentially pull on the first day of service. With the completion of the 3 processing plants under construction, we will have a total of 19 Permian processing plants capable of producing 675,000 barrels a day of NGLs, beating our NGL systems, including one of the world's largest NGL export capacities.  We also began service on Phase 1 of our Texas Western products pipeline system in March, successfully connecting Gulf Coast refined products to end markets in the Permian Basin, with additional Phase II destinations in the Albuquerque and Grand Junction markets expected in the second and early third quarters.  At the beginning of the month, we received the deepwater port license or a SPOT project. This is one of the most significant milestones to date in the development of SPOT. We put out a press release on April 9 discussing the project and highlighting the accomplishment of the enterprise team that worked tirelessly for over 5 years, tirelessly for over 5 years to obtain the license. I think SPOT's going to be a valuable and highly strategic addition to our asset base as we continue with commercialization.  Last week, the EIA reported that the U.S. exported a record 12.1 million barrels a day of liquids, that being crude oil, refined products and natural gas liquids to a world, hungry for our reliable resources that's priced by free market. To put that in perspective, the number was $3.6 million in 2014 and less than $2 million in 2010.  Demand for growing U.S. liquids has been and will continue to be primarily in emerging markets. Enterprise will continue to play a key role. We export around 70 million barrels a month of liquids and have an initiative to reach 100 million barrels a month, which does not include SPOT -- we're a significant player in the export market, and we expect our growth is going to continue to grow. Randy? Yes, I'll talk to the CapEx. First of all, it's not what was in the there's article by a long shot, and we typically don't share with people what our CapEx is. I'll turn it over to Brent to answer the other question. Spiro, I had a dream one night that we got to 100 million barrels. So I made it an initiative. If you're going to get to 100 million barrels, you're going to get it because you've got a great supply position. So some of the things Natalie is talking about is building your supply position, and we know what it takes to get to that number and what we need to do from a supply perspective. And I don't think -- I don't think Zach, I don't think we have to spend a heck of a lot of money on -- or Jay, on our ship channel or any of our docs in order to handle that my... Bob.

            "name": "Randy Fowler",
            "content": "Right. Okay. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Starting with first quarter income statement items. Net income attributable to common unitholders for the first quarter of 2024 increased 5% to $1.5 billion or $0.66 per common unit on a fully diluted basis compared to $1.4 billion or $0.63 per common unit for the first quarter of 2023.  Turning to cash flow. Adjusted cash flow from operations, which is cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital increased 6% to $2.1 billion for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $2 billion for the first quarter of last year.  We declared a distribution of $0.515 per common unit for the first quarter of 2024. As Jim mentioned, this is a 5.1% increase over the distribution declared with regard to the first quarter of 2023. The distribution will be paid May 14 to common unitholders of record as of the close of business today.  In the first quarter, the partnership purchased approximately 1.4 million common units of the open market for $40 million, total purchases for the 12 months ending March 31 were $211 million or approximately 8 million enterprise common units, bringing total purchases under our buyback program to approximately $960 million.  In addition to buybacks, our distribution reinvestment plan and employee unit purchase plan purchased a combined 6.5 million common units on the open market for $172 million during the last 12 months, including 1.6 million common units on the open market for $43 million during the first quarter of 2024.  For the 12 months ended March 31, 2024, Enterprise paid out approximately $4.4 billion in distributions to limited partners combined with the $211 million of common unit repurchases across the same time period. Enterprise's payout ratio of adjusted cash flow from operations was 56% for that 12-month period.  Total capital investments in the first quarter were $1.1 billion, which included $875 million for growth capital projects and $180 million of sustaining CapEx.  We expect growth capital expenditures for 2024 and 2025 to be in the range of $3.25 billion to $3.75 billion. We continue to estimate 2024 sustaining capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million, which includes planned turnarounds at both of our PDH plants our iBDH facility, and high-purity isobutylene facility. As previously mentioned, these scheduled turnarounds typically occur every 3 to 4 years. At this time, we expect the PDH turnaround to be completed in May 2024. We plan to begin addressing the issues on the fourth reactor within PDH 2 in June.  Our total debt principal outstanding was approximately $29.7 billion as of March 31, 2024. Assuming the final maturity date for our hybrids, the weighted average life of our debt portfolio is approximately 19 years. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.7%.  At March 31, approximately 98% of our debt was fixed rate. Our consolidated liquidity was approximately $4.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, including availability under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash on hand. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $2.5 billion and $9.5 billion for the trailing 12 months. As of March 31, 2024, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.0x on a net basis after adjusting debt for the partial equity treatment of our hybrid debt and reducing the debt outstanding by the partnership's unrestricted cash on hand.  As a reminder, our leverage target remains 3.0x, plus or minus 0.25x. And with that, Libby, I think we can open it up for questions. Keith, over the last 3 or 4 years, I mean, the stock prices ebbed and flowed just with the overall volatility in the energy sector in the space. So I mean, it comes and goes. I think we try to keep an all-above approach. And when we see it attractive to do buybacks, we do that. But it's been measured, call it, $200 million, $250 million a year, and I expect it to stay in that area. Our growth CapEx, our projects that were coming in are attractive returns on capital that actually grow our business and serve our customers. So yes, I mean, we take a look at it, but you don't make allocation of capital issue, allocation of capital decisions day by day, depending on where the stock price is. So we've got a longer-term view than that. Yes. Neal, -- what we had talked about at Analyst Day here a few weeks ago was really from a combination of distributions and buybacks sort of operating in that 55% to 60% of adjusted cash flow from operations. We've sort of been in that zone since 2021. And that's sort of what we foresee here for the next few years as well. As far as organic growth CapEx, again, seeing a lot of opportunities in the Permian and also what that -- the downstream benefits that come with that increased supply as it goes through our value chain. And now with getting the license for SPOT, we'll be hustling to come in and get it contracted. So I think we still come back with a bogey of what we put out in 2026, and that's early, is $2 billion, $2.5 billion, of which only $800 million of that is currently approved projects. So we've got some room to fill that up, including coming in and with SPOT. We're successful in getting that underwritten SPOT is really a 3-year construction cycle on that. And so anyway, I think that would help come in and address that $2 billion, $2.5 billion of organic growth CapEx. Yes. Neal, I think we'll have more flexibility on buybacks. And again, we look to be opportunistic with it. So I mean, you've seen us do $200 million or $300 million here over the last few years. I mean if there was a market dislocation, we've got the flexibility to do more. And then certainly, here in 2024 and 2025, we're looking at growth CapEx in the $3.25 billion to $3.75 billion range. I think once you get back out to 2026, 2027. And if we're in a more of what I would say, normalized CapEx range, $2 billion, $2.5 billion, then we'll have a lot more flexibility to do buy back then as well."

I was just curious on your expectations for domestic prices on the propane side? And do you see this widening the spreads to the international markets? And then on that, can you just remind us of the sensitivity and exposure you guys have to that spread? Got it. That makes sense. I appreciate that. And then moving to Wink to Webster. I saw no doubt that you guys might have some downtime at the beginning of Q2. I was curious, one, if you can comment on that and 2, if you can move those volumes to another asset like Midland to L1 and just the overall impact there. Perfect fact. All I had..."

            "content": "I mean the commercialization, Theresa, is still ongoing, I'd say, for the most part, it's positive. We're spending a lot of time on the road. We expect to have 2 contracts by the end of, call it, next month. And then we're in ongoing discussions with other counterparties to commercialize that. But the mindset is we're not going to move forward on that project until we have the contracts to support that project. Keith, it's Brent. I think we'd like to target before the end of this year to go forward on that project. And I think overall, and Zach, it's Brent. -- propane is going to be constrained here domestically until new export capacity comes online. And so call that next year, you could probably see storage values start widening out because that's the only place could go at this point. I think it's probably good for some of our other assets or our customers around PDH. But once you get out until next year and the years beyond, we think the appetite for LPGs is there across the world. We think freight is going to be there. So at some point in time, it's going to come back to the U.S. producer and for them to catch up to align with the export capacity, the freight and the overall global demand. This is Brent. Relative to our first quarter, there was definitely an impact because of weather in the Midland Basin processing side. Our Delaware processing plants held up very well. On the Midland side, we had some downtime and it probably extended gram for 10 days at some point. But that's the reason there's probably an effect on volumes. But to Natalie's point, in terms of what we see as we go forward, and we have a morning supply meeting that you guys are well aware of, it's routine for every day that Natalie comes in to report our processing volumes. That's up every single day. Natalie, I mean we saw the increase, our big jump on our side once our new plants came up."
