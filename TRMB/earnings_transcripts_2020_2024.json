At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Now, I would like to turn it over to Mr. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer of Trimble. \nRob Painter: Hello everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. In addition, please note that we will be comparing against the 2019 that had a 14th week in the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s start on Slide 2 with the three key messages we want to convey today. First, the customer ROI of our technology and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the fourth quarter. Our customer value proposition is rooted in productivity, quality, safety, visibility, and sustainability. We are pleased to announce that annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, while quarterly revenue grew 0.4% year-over-year to $830 million. Expanding gross margins and execution on costs led to adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, and we finished the year delivering a record $672 million of operating cash flow. Second, executing the Connect & Scale 2025 strategy remains our focus. We are working to connect stakeholders across industry lifecycles and to transform customer workflows, while simultaneously making ourselves easier to do business with. As leaders of the business, we take our responsibility seriously to be effective allocators of capital. To this end, we will continue to invest disproportionately in our cloud and autonomy capabilities, as well as in go-to-market efforts to support and enable our long-term growth opportunities. Third, our long-term market conviction remains strong. We believe the secular trends of digitization provide long-term tailwinds and we maintain our resolve to exit this crisis on a stronger competitive footing than we entered it. As we come into 2021, we are both cautious and humble to recognize market uncertainty and volatility, while also confident that we are on the right track. Comparisons against 2020, especially on a quarterly basis, will be difficult, if not irrelevant. We will reinstate guidance at an annual level, and David will walk you through the details. In addition, we anticipate hosting an Investor Day in the second half of the year to update stakeholders on our long-term strategy and business model. As I reflect back on our May 2018 Investor Day and put that into context of our fiscal year 2020, while revenue is clearly set back with the pandemic, we are ahead in most all other aspects. At the Investor Day, we targeted adjusted 2021 EBITDA at 23% to 24% of revenue. We closed 2020 at 25.3% EBITDA. We targeted 2021 software services and recurring revenue mix at 55% of total revenue. We closed 2020 at 58% of total revenue. We targeted the ratio of 2021 operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income at approximately 1.1 times. We closed 2020 at 1.2 times operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income. In July 2018, our net-debt-to-EBITA ratio stood above 3 times and we said we would de-lever below 2.5 times. Today, we stand at 1.6 times. We see these as important proof points that we are on the right strategic path that we can uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds to deliver value to our customers and that our asset light business model works. Turning to my commentary on the fourth quarter, we beat our own expectations in Buildings & Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities. We hit our expectations in Transportation. Broadly speaking, we have seen signs of an emerging construction led recovery. We are experiencing favorable market conditions in agriculture. We see our innovation and go-to-market execution driving positive outcomes, and at the end of the year we benefited from government stimulus measures along with customers catching up on work.  David will walk us through additional segment details. Turning to Slide 3, this shows Connect & Scale delivering customer ROI in Transportation and Agriculture. In Transportation, our Trimble Dispatch Advisor solutions bring capabilities across our portfolio together to get the right load on the right truck with the right driver; thereby improving planning, reducing empty miles, and improving utilization. In Agriculture, Zlatiya Agro is a large farm enterprise in Bulgaria that has adopted Trimble's Connected Farm ecosystem across 100 of their machines. This offering consists of our GFX750 Connected display, and Autopilot steering along with our AutoSync data exchange functionality. The connected offering improves planning, process automation, and cost optimization. I will close my commentary on Slide 4 with an ESG update, a topic of increasing importance to all of our stakeholders. As a purpose-driven company, our mission of industry transformation and our leadership culture provides a compelling ESG backdrop. In the area of environmental sustainability, I'll highlight that the primary positive impact of Trimble on greenhouse gas emission reductions and other environmental measures happens through customer application of our technology. For example, eliminating rework in construction, reducing fuel and water usage in all our end-markets, and minimizing use of herbicides and pesticides in agriculture. We are also committed to developing science-based targets to further our positive impact. In the area of people and social responsibility, I\u2019ll highlight that we ranked in the top 10% of companies for diversity in the Comparably survey. I\u2019m also very proud of the work of the Trimble Foundation, where we contributed a record amount of money to put to work for our philanthropic efforts. Finally, in the area of corporate governance, our ratings with third-party firms like MSCI are strong, and we are committed to continuous improvement in our sustainability program. David, over to you.\nDavid Barnes: Thanks Rob. Let\u2019s begin on Slide 5, with a review of fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter total revenue was $830 million on a non-GAAP basis, up 0.4% year-over-year. To break that down, currency translation added 1% and acquisitions, net of divestitures, were essentially neutral. Organic growth, excluding the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2019, was approximately 2%. ARR, or annualized recurring revenue grew to $1.30 billion in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year, and was up 7% on an organic basis. Organic ARR growth, excluding the Transportation segment was up 15%. Adjusted EBITDA, which includes income from our joint ventures and equity investments, was $217 million with a margin of 26.1%, reflecting both strong gross margins and continuing low operating costs. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 16%, down 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Net income was up 16% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.61, up 15% year-over-year. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $188 million, up 54% year-over-year, while cash flow from operations for the full-year was $672 million, up 15% versus 2019. Free cash flow, which we defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures, was $177 million for the quarter, up 64% year-over-year, and $615 million for the year, up 19% versus 2019. Note that on a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was approximately 1.2 times non-GAAP net income. Our strong cash flow results reflect the combination of higher profit and improved working capital efficiency. With a strong cash flow in the quarter, we continued to de-lever. At year-end, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 1.6 times. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with flexibility to consider a range of capital allocation options. We expect to continue to de-lever and pursue modest share buybacks, while having dry powder deployable for attractive acquisition opportunities. Turning to Page 6, I\u2019d like to highlight one of the key drivers of our cash flow in the quarter, working capital. Our working capital efficiency has improved over the last 5 years. We ended the year with just over zero net working capital. This progress was driven by a number of factors, including the growth in deferred revenue from our recurring revenue businesses, reduced [days sales outstanding] of accounts receivable, and lower inventory levels. Turning now to Slide 7, I\u2019ll review in a bit more detail our fourth quarter revenue trends. As I mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our non-recurring revenue streams also grew, driven by a strong rebound in hardware sales in geospatial, civil construction, and agriculture. From a geographic perspective, North America revenues were down 8%, driven by declines in our Transportation business. Revenues in North America from businesses other than Transportation grew 2%. Europe revenues were up 9%, reflecting catch-up on project activity slowed earlier in 2020 and fiscal stimulus measures. Asia Pacific was the best performer in the quarter, up 13%, driven by strong performance in Japan. The Rest of World, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 10% year-over-year driven principally by strong demand from the agricultural sector. Now turning to Slide 8, I\u2019ll review briefly our full-year results. Revenue for the full-year 2020 contracted 4% overall and 5% organically. Gross margins for the year expanded 140 basis points, and EBITDA grew 7% on a year-over-year basis. EBITDA margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3%. Operating income grew 7% year-over-year, and operating income margins expanded 220 basis points to 22.8%. Net income was up 12% and earnings per share were $2.23, up 12% year-over-year. Next, on Slide 9, we highlight a number of key metrics, which collectively give a good picture of the state of our business. I\u2019ll highlight a few metrics, which neither Rob nor I have already mentioned. In this year of strong margins, we continued to spend over 15% of our revenue in research and development, reflecting our continued investment in areas of strategic importance during the downturn. We ended the year with a backlog of $1.3 billion, up 11% from year ago levels. Our deferred revenue at the end of the year was $614 million, up 13% from the end of 2019. The health of our backlog and deferred revenue point to improved visibility for revenue growth heading into 2021. Turning now to Slide 10, let's go through the fourth quarter revenue details at the reporting segment level. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 1% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of last year\u2019s extra week, organic revenue for the segment would have been up approximately 4%. Revenue growth was double digit in both our SketchUp and Civil hardware businesses. Segment margins were up 90 basis points due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 14% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core surveying and mapping business. Revenue was up in all regions, aided by successful new products, stimulus-driven activity, and healthy project tender levels as projects which were delayed earlier in 2020 came back on line. Margins were up over 9 percentage points, due to a combination of higher margin revenue mix, lower levels of discounting, and strong cost control. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis, driven principally by our precision agriculture business. Revenue growth was strongest outside the U.S., with higher commodity prices, stimulus programs, favorable weather, and a strong reception to our new products all contributing to growth in the quarter. Solid performance by our Cityworks business, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of last year, also contributed to segment revenue in the quarter. Margins expanded over 5 percentage points, driven by operating cost control. Transportation revenue was down 22% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2019, organic revenues were down by about 19%. Operating margins were down over 8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Our fourth quarter financial performance in Transportation reflects many of the same factors we have discussed in prior quarters. Customer attrition in our mobility business since late 2019 accounts for the majority of the adverse development in segment revenue, ARR, and margins. On that front there is some good news, as our product performance has improved and customer churn has declined sequentially in each of the last three quarters. Note that the ongoing subscription transition in our Transportation enterprise software business [to press revenue] trends in the quarter, and the Kuebix acquisition had an expected dilutive impact on segment margins. While we have more work ahead of us to improve the performance of this business, we continue to believe in the power of our connected Transportation strategy and project the steps the team is taking now will yield improved performance later in 2021. Turning now to Page 11, I\u2019d like to share with you our outlook for this year. Our planning efforts have settled on a 2021 financial outlook based on a number of key assumptions. First, we assume that public health initiatives are successful in enabling a broad re-opening of constrained sectors of the economy by mid-year 2021. Second, our plan is rooted in the assumption that the economy grows through the year, with 2021 GDP at least recovering to 2019 levels. Third, our projections exclude the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures. Our most important key performance indicator will continue to be ARR. We expect organic ARR growth to end 2021 in the high-single-digit range, with sequential improvement as the quarter\u2019s progress. ARR growth in 2021 will be driven by the combination of organic growth of our existing recurring offerings, ongoing transitions from perpetual software products, and the gradual turnaround of our Transportation business. We project organic revenue growth in 2021 in the mid-single-digit range, with an additional 1-2 points if exchange rates remain near where they are today. That translates to a revenue range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Note that our revenue growth in 2021 will be negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points from our subscription model transitions. We anticipate that EBITDA and operating margins in 2021 will be higher than 2019, but lower than 2020. Overall our gross margins this year are projected to remain stable with 2020 levels. But a number of factors are likely to cause EBITDA margins to come down somewhat when compared to the historically high levels of 2020. First, the return to a more normalized level of incentive compensation, and in the second half of this year, higher travel costs will naturally cause operating costs to grow at a rate faster than revenue. Second, we are incrementally allocating more capital in both CapEx and operating expense to the areas of focus in our Connect & Scale strategy: namely digital transformation, cloud infrastructure, and autonomy. Third, our margins will be negatively impacted by the accelerated subscription model conversions of 150 basis points. I\u2019ll note that we project income from equity method investments to be approximately $35 million to $40 million, and net interest expense to be about $65 million to $70 million with decreasing levels as the year progresses. We project our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 17%, and that our shares outstanding will be approximately 254 million. Incorporating all of these factors, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 for the full-year. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to project that operating cash flow and free cash flow will exceed net income, as the favorable cash characteristics of our business will continue. Nevertheless, cash flow will likely be flat or decline modestly from 2020 levels, as we saw extraordinary improvement in working capital in late 2020. A few words on the segment dynamics in our outlook: Generally we expect that each of our segments will mirror the trends I have just described, although I\u2019ll highlight a few factors specific to the individual segments. In Buildings & Infrastructure, our hardware offerings were most adversely impacted by COVID in the second quarter of 2020, so we expect growth in the second quarter of 2021 to be very strong. Our Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities businesses have a lot of momentum now and we anticipate that momentum to generate strong growth through the first half of the year with more moderate growth thereafter. In Transportation, we don\u2019t expect to see meaningful revenue growth or margin improvement until late in 2021. We don\u2019t intend to provide quarterly guidance at this point. But I\u2019ll offer a few comments on factors that will influence our revenue and margin performance as the year progresses. Year-on-year growth in each quarter will obviously be impacted by the COVID-driven swings we have seen in 2020. We expect to grow in all four quarters, with the strongest growth rate in the second quarter, when we lap the worst period of the COVID crisis. We expect that operating and EBITDA margins will be relatively constant across the quarters. Rob, back to you for closing comments.\nRob Painter: As we wrap up, I would like to thank the Trimble team and our global dealer partner network for their outstanding efforts throughout 2020. We entered the crisis with an objective to exit the crisis on a stronger competitive footing. I\u2019m proud of our accomplishments in 2020 and the progress and commitment we are making towards our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. We enter 2021 with increased conviction in our ability to fulfill our mission to \u201cTransform the Way the World Works.\u201d Furthermore, I\u2019d also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Trimble\u2019s inclusion in the S&P 500 as of January 21, a milestone for Trimble\u2019s growth and global impact. Thank you to our customers, our global dealer partners, and our employees past and present for making this possible. It has been a remarkable 42-year journey as a company, and our best days are yet to come. Operator, let\u2019s please go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. \nRob Wertheimer: Hi, good afternoon, everyone.\nRob Painter: Hi, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: Results continue to be very impressive on the margin side, and really among the better companies that we follow, I kind of have a strategic question on the results, it is just, it seems like farmers continue to adopt very quickly, you know, whatever tech offerings they're offered. There\u2019s been a lot of, you know take rate success with different products, people have put out. My question is a little bit on how you see the shape of that market evolving? Whether there's a lot in the acquisition pipeline that you want to do or need to do to create increasingly integrated offerings? And, you know how strong your product pipeline is for the next couple or three years? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Rob. So if we look at the primary products that we offer in the agriculture market today, that would capture guidance, it would capture water management, it would include the variable rates, and then we also have the weed seeker product. So spot spray optimization, and then I would, you know, and then there's the software that we have. And so the strategy we have is the connected farm strategy in agriculture. So, just from an organic view of our product portfolio, we are bullish on the opportunities in agriculture to connect what we're doing together to create additional ROI for our customers. What we'll build on top of that is our autonomy strategy, and we see autonomy as a series of increasing levels of automation over the coming quarters and years to move us really more into that autonomous future. So, we believe we can do a lot of this organically. From an acquisition perspective, you know, we're certainly open if there's acquisitions that could help us accelerate our development and our efforts in any of those, any of those areas.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks, Rob. Are you able to give any metrics on this hand spray, how that product has been going? And I'll stop. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Well, we've seen strong double-digit increases in the Weedseeker and the Weedseeker 2. So, yeah, we\u2019ve seen strong increases and really think we're going to see them really for a while. We initially saw that the take rate being very high in South America and then we see that moving around the world.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJason Celino: Yeah. Thanks, guys. So you gave the update on the transportation enterprise bookings were 80% of subscription. But I'm curious, you know, what was that mix at the beginning of the year because you've talked about accelerating the transition here? And then, more broadly speaking, how should investors measure the progress of the different business solutions you have? And then why not give more metrics like this on a more recurring basis?\nRob Painter: So Jason, this is Rob -- at the beginning of the year, we were tracking closer to an inverse of that, because we're really pretty early in the transformation of our enterprise business, so that bookings mix is pretty, actually exceeded our expectations of how quickly it has shifted to subscription offering. And when we do that 80/20 comparison, that\u2019s at a TCV or total contract value levels, right. So, we can do it on an apple-to-apple basis. In terms of measuring the progress of the business and how we measure and look at the proof points in the business, we'll certainly hit on the first one right away, which is the ratio of the of the bookings because that's what we're, you know, the strategy, the end game, from a financial model perspective is to build a recurring offering, and we're talking about the enterprise business because we already have that in our maps business. We already have that in our mobility business, and we really also have that in our shipper business. So, really it's an additive view of moving that direction. And finally, you asked about, you know, additional measures or metrics that we could report in transportation. I think we have an Investor Day. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're going to target for the second half of the year. I think it's \u2013 we just have to make sure we get the right ones to tell the right story. I'm as \u2013 I think, as much as anything showing proof points, like the customer examples, such as the example that was in one of the slides, is the kind of demonstrable evidence that I want to be able to continue to put forward to our investors.\nJason Celino: Okay, great. Those were my two. So, thank you.\nRob Painter: You're welcome.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.\nAnn Duignan: Hi, good evening it\u2019s Ann Duignan, just FYI. Maybe, Rob, you could give us a rundown on the B&I business, just, you know, the different applications there, and some of the trends you're seeing and you know, usually give us an update on ARR for SketchUp, e-Builder Viewpoint, etcetera just, you know, a little deeper dive into that business and the outlook into 2021 specifically?\nRob Painter : Sure. Hi, Ann, it\u2019s good to hear from you. So let's start in B&I if we run through the outlook, and what we're hearing from some of the different constituents throughout the chain. I\u2019d start with saying that the outlook is pretty good. There are a few exceptions, but the outlook is pretty good. If we look at the type of work, infrastructure and residential backlogs are improving. EPC is down, so that's going to relate to oil and gas multi-sector, which picks up commercial work that looks flat to down, and not surprisingly retail is down and elements such as data centers and logistics centers are up. When we look at the public sector, the outlook is generally better than it was a quarter as you know the financing is in a stronger position. In January, the Dodge index was at its highest level since the pandemic started. Now, they did warn the recovery may be uneven in the coming months, which sounds about right. And at an OEM level, I would say the signals are mixed, so it is stronger and heavy equipment less so in the automotive space. So, in aggregate that outlook is a net positive. On the ARR front and B&I, really a very solid quarter, really the teams executed at an outstanding level in the quarter and for the year. Our net retention in businesses such as e-Builder and Viewpoint, they're well over a 100%. We had mid-teens ARR growth in Viewpoint and e-Builder. So, continued strong performance from those businesses and those operators. Did I miss anything Ann?\nAnn Duignan: No, I think you captured it all pretty eloquently. Maybe just switching back to transportation, can you just talk a little bit about, you know, what happens if you cannot get the business back to the 20% margin target? You know, what are the strategic alternatives? You know would you be willing now, will you be willing to look at some portfolio cleansing or is the business too strategic to you, you know, even if it takes longer to get back to 20% you're going to ride it out and just curious over the long-term what your contingency plans are?\nRob Painter: The transportation business we see as strategic when we see it as attractive. We think we've got a favorable position and a favorable offering. And, you know, I think we have the, say the coverage of assets in this sector, which I think would be quite enviable from a competitive standpoint. So from the 20% level, that's absolutely the target that we have is to get this segment backup to the, I\u2019ll call it the company level of profitability. In terms of how we measure that, you know, given how much of the business is recurring, we'll also look at it from a customer lifetime value perspective. So, I'll be cautious to be overly dogmatic about the 20% so long as we're continuing to get the bookings and to grow the business \u2013 grow the business and get that trajectory. So, the first order of business is to be able to show that demonstrable trajectory, which we said, we feel like we'll be able to do towards the later part of the year, second half of the year. And as we've got that trajectory, I think that's going to give all of us the confidence in what we're doing. And you know, we'll look at measures such as lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition cost, because that's a very indicative measure of how the business progresses. And then from the broader, I\u2019d say strategic lens of it, we'll continue to look at \u2013 be open to looking at assets or partnerships that help us further and accelerate the strategy.\nAnn Duignan: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. I\u2019ll get back in line. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thank you for taking our questions. This is [Kristin] on for Colin. Just wanted to ask a little bit about some of the increased spend that you've highlighted for 2021, the CapEx and OpEx targeting Connect and Scale, the digital information, cloud infrastructure autonomy, etcetera. And just wanted to see, you know, if you could provide a little bit more color there and where you're seeing exactly the opportunities to accelerate and how that connects back to the Connect and Scale strategy?\nDavid Barnes: Hi, [Kristin] it\u2019s David Barnes. So, as you pointed out, a meaningful portion of the increase in year-on-year operating expenditure will be really centered on the Connect and Scale strategy. So, we have a major initiative underway to accelerate our digital transformation. There\u2019s technology and process changes that will enable us to fulfill the potential we have to sell integrated offerings to customers, and we have a major push there. So, our CapEx, which was in the past two years more focused on facilities is this year very much focused on digital transformation, and cloud infrastructure as well, which will enable us to enhance our position as a world-class provider, integrated cloud based services. So that's where the focus of our investment is.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And then I guess my follow-up would be, Rob, you [hearkened] us back to the 2018 Analyst Day. You know, back at that time, I think you outlined a calculus of high-single-digit organic growth, you know, 25% to 30%, incremental margins 20% operating margin, you know, as they think about Connect and Scale, and maybe beyond the 2021 timeframe, is that still the right formula that we should be thinking about for Trimble?\nRob Painter: At a high level, it is [Kristin]. What I would augment from a measurement perspective is ARR growth. That is our primary focus of the, you know, the measurements out there. And that interplay, you know, between ARR, and the overall growth is important. So, I'll trade all day long. The top line revenue growth if it's going, if it's moderated because we're accelerating ARR and that's one that I think needs to rise higher in the pecking order.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Next is from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Thanks for taking our question and congrats on the quarter and the progress. I maybe wanted to touch again on the geospatial side, and I know in your prepared remarks, you kind of noted one of the drivers being retail demand in North America. And that seems interesting, just given a preferences for where people live coming out of the pandemic and strong just residential construction more broadly. Can you maybe remind us how much of that business is exposed to residential construction? And you know, if you think that can be a lasting tailwind if it's more near term and source normalized and just what your expectations are over the next year or so?\nRob Painter: Sure, and I'll start by up leveling to the whole segment where we saw the outperformance come from a combination of three things: healthy demand, catch up in work, and the third is new products. So, in Europe, we know we think there's an anticipation of a construction led recovery tax incentives also helped, I should add. In North America, there's residential and from the new product innovation perspective our R12i GNSS receiver and the X7 scanner we think really led demand in all our markets. In North America specifically, and looking at residential, we see that as a near to mid-term catalyst, and then I would, you know, have an anticipation of normalization there. If we were to see, you know, more infrastructure work, then clearly our mix would shift or balance with the residential and infrastructure work. Historically, residential has not been a primary driver of the Trimble business. So, it certainly has been an accelerant, certainly from a percentage standpoint.\nJames Faucette: Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just one follow up, I guess, as perpetual licenses started to recover, at least grew in the quarter, I guess some of that\u2019s seasonally based just on timing of when those get renewed or should we think of that as more indicative of demand just broadly recovering? And if some of the push-outs and subscription growth could also be an opportunity to more quickly convert to subscription based offerings?\nDavid Barnes: Yeah, hey, James. It\u2019s David. Part of what you saw with the perpetual business is, we had meaningful slowdown in earlier quarters, as you'll know. So there's \u2013 some of that is catch up on projects that were delayed. Overall, the perpetual sales will obviously be \u2013 there will be pressure on that from the subscription transition. So, over time, in many of our businesses, the significant majority, we will be selling recurring rather than perpetual licenses for those businesses where a recurring model is viable.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is coming in from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein.\nChad Dillard: Good evening, guys. So my question is on, just like the mid-cycle revenues for the transportation business? And how to think about that in this coming cycle versus prior cycles, you know, do expect to actually recover some of the churn that you've experienced? And then how should we think about the impact of, you know, the mix shift \u2013 some of the mix shift in there?\nRob Painter: We'll start with the question around cycle, because it tends not to be relevant in the Trimble context. It tends to be, you know, I would associate that to an industrial \u2013 a straight industrial context, and the fundamental nature of the markets that we're serving as their large global underserved and under penetrated by technology. So our correlation hasn't historically been very tight to cycles. So, I would really see the Trimble story as a secular story with a cyclical undertone. So, the cycle obviously has an impact, but a secular first cyclical undertone. From an expectation of, I think you asked about recovering turn, recovering business in the transportation market. Yes, we're very optimistic around that. I mean, that's table stakes, frankly. And we look at the pieces we have across the technology, landscape, and transportation, and we think we're in a favorite position. We've got over 90% of the top 100 trucking companies use our technology. We've got over a million powered assets. They're managed in the Trimble network. I look at the set of capabilities we have. We do telematics, video, ERP, maintenance, mapping, routing, navigation, analytics, visibility.  So, we have a strong set of capabilities. I believe it brings scale to the market. And when we look at Connect and Scale applied in the transportation context, that's where I think we've become really unique as if we can sell [outcome], we look at the bundled offerings. And then not only bundled offerings, but where we can provide unique value by stitching together our products. And that's actually why we put that slide as an example of Trimble dispatch advisor because into the slides is because that's an example where we're pulling capabilities across our tech stack into a uniquely Trimble \u2013 and to a unique Trimble offering. So, I hope that helps \u2013 give you context and let me know if I missed something.\nChad Dillard: Yeah, no, that's, that's helpful. And then just second question, just on the 150 basis points, so we've had one from subscription transitions, can you remind us, how does it compare versus 2020? And, you know, how should we think about that in the context of the next couple of years? Are we at the peak in terms of like the overall basis point impact?\nDavid Barnes: Hi Chad, it\u2019s David. The 150 basis points is more than 2020, probably about half again more. So, we're closer to 100 basis points. And that does reflect that in some of the businesses where there's a clear near term opportunity to make the transition. We anticipate making major progress this year. A little early to call [2022] on that. So, I'll resist the temptation, although we are, at that point getting past the valley for many of the subscription businesses, and we'll see more revenue uptick from that than we will this year.\nChad Dillard: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is coming from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon and good evening, everyone. Nice to see the momentum on subscription transition, I'm wondering if you could talk about any parts of the transition plan that you folks might be accelerating, heading into 2021, given how strong the preference has been among customers for subscription versus perpetual license. And, David, I'm wondering if you could share the revenue number that's associated with that margin point that you just made? So, if we had, you know, run rate revenue, in 2021, how much higher would it be versus you know, the GAAP revenue guidance that you're providing once we get, you know, the existing products, transition to subscription?\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Jerry, I'll do the second question first, and then hand it over to rob. So, I think I've got your question, right. The 150 basis points, what we're saying there is that if we weren't doing the next round of transitions, our revenue would be 150 basis points higher, and that nearly all flows to operating income, because the margin is very high.\nRob Painter: And Jerry, from acceleration perspective, within the business, I look at Buildings and Infrastructure and Transportation. So within Buildings and Infrastructure, you know, we're talking about our building construction businesses accelerating the subscription transformations there. We mentioned in transportation, for example, the 80/20, booking split subscription to perpetual that we're seeing in the enterprise business right now. So, there I would call those the model conversions that are accelerating. And, you know, that's separate from businesses that you already know, like the viewpoints in builders and construction that continue to demonstrate strong growth. And then the last thing I would mention is, on the hardware side, you know, we are in very early days, but you know, early days of the \u2013 essentially it\u2019s the hard ways of service, we call it Trimble platform as a service in the civil construction phase.\nJerry Revich: And in terms of capital deployment, can you talk about your M&A pipeline, as it stands today, obviously, strong free cash conversion. I'm wondering how deep is that pipeline? Because, you know, unfortunately, post the e-Builder and Viewpoint acquisitions, you know, multiples for those types of assets have moved up significantly. So, I'm wondering if you could just comment on, if the pipeline has subscription type businesses in it, and just expand on that opportunity set in-light of the free cash flow, if you don't mind?\nRob Painter: Hey Jerry, I characterize our M&A pipeline as being open for business. We have the confidence to assert our strategy, and we have the balance sheet to support it. As it relates to the, I\u2019d say the opportunities themselves within the pipeline. I would say they're decent. I wouldn't say they're like overly robust. And on the other side there, you know, it's also not non-existent. So, I'd say it's a decent pipeline. And when we look at that pipeline, we certainly have a bias. You know, we think about that with a bias, well it\u2019s more than a bias, the imperative is to support the Connect and Scale strategy. The bias, then within supporting the strategy is certainly towards software assets. But David also mentioned, you know, from a \u2013 linking it to capital allocation, where we're spending on the digital transformation, we look at capabilities and cloud, we look at capabilities and autonomy, for example. And so autonomy is another area that I would, you know put on that list, and I wouldn't \u2013 it doesn't classically define a software.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Richard Eastman from Baird.\nRichard Eastman: Hey, I just want to circle back if you wouldn't mind, and good afternoon, by the way, just wanted to circle back to \u2013 the recurring revenue in the quarter looks like it was down, you know, a couple ticks year-over-year. Is that a function of the transportation business?\nRob Painter: Hey, Rick. Organic ARR was actually up a little bit. We should have a business, but yeah, organics improved a little bit.\nRichard Eastman: And when you define organic, are you pulling out transportation?\nRob Painter: Nope. I'm pulling out the business. Hey, Rick, if you just be careful, you're looking at the 14th week impact. Because the recurring revenue, just take that piece of the P&L. That has an 8% impact.\nRichard Eastman: I see. Okay. All right, then that's going to be the difference. So, organic ARR in the quarter was up low singles. And then for 2021, did I catch in your comments that recurring revenue is expected to grow high single digits?\nRob Painter: Yeah. So organic was up 7 in the Q4, and we said we'd end the year, our guidance is high-single-digits. So, faster than we are now, sequentially improving through the year for all the reasons I mentioned: organic growth of our existing offerings, the transitions and improvement of transportation.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. And then, as we look out to, you know, your revenue guide, and your, you know, adjusted op income guide, and EPS guide I guess, you know, at the mid-point of your revenue guide, and EPS guide, we kind of walk up to this, maybe low, low double digits, incremental. And what that's absorbing here, I'm sorry, probably ever repeating what you said already. But what that's absorbing is, you know, almost 50 million of profit from the SaaS conversion headwind, and then the balance of that would be just expense re-inflation in the business.\nRob Painter: Yeah, you've got the key factors. So, the conversions are there. And then OpEx, as I mentioned, is growing faster than revenue. Some of that is just replacing costs that that sort of naturally came out during the COVID period. So, we will have higher incentive compensation expense. We anticipate that we\u2019ll begin to travel later in the year. A lot of the things we do normally including hiring were really low. And we are investing, as Rob said in the cloud and digital transformation. And then I'll add that part of the OpEx increase is FX because the U.S. dollars weaken. So, over half of our business is outside the U.S. so that naturally causes OpEx to grow.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. I get you. And just one last question, I apologize, the civil business, how do inventories in the channel look there? Is there better \u2013 it is book-to-bill or just the sell through, you know, is the sell through greater than the sell-in into the channel on the civil side, the hardware side?\nRob Painter: Inventories are low. Yeah.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. Okay. Very good. Excellent. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Next question is from the line from Jonathan Ho from William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to start out with, I guess you made the comment that you're coming out of the downturn stronger and you've been investing 15% into R&D, which is above the typical average. Can you maybe give us some examples of how this has been driving share gains and where you're seeing this show up the most in terms of that competitive position?\nRob Painter: Hi Jonathan, I see it in a few areas. One would be through innovation. And so an example we talked about in geospatial is with the R12i and the X7, so the right demonstrable evidence that the investment in R&D is producing new products. And we've seen that in Ag with Weedseeker. As an example, we've seen it in Buildings and Infrastructure with the model conversions, a lot of innovation actually happening there and creating some derivative opportunities in areas such as analytics, for example. And the other place where I see us coming out of \u2013 stronger is from an organizational culture perspective. Okay, that's hard to, let's say, measure as it relates to share gains or the other aspects. But I really think when you look at our employee engagement it's in a very strong place. We look at the retention of our people. We're doing well there. We look at \u2013 I talked to \u2013 used an example in the prepared remarks around how we've ranked in diversity and inclusion score. So, we see the culture in a strong place. And then from a share gain aspect, how all of this relates to, let's say, share gains in our competitive position, it's \u2013 I have to admit it's notoriously difficult to be very specific on share gains in our markets. It's just really not a lot of good data. So, you can't \u2013 you really can't find like the singular report that's going to tell you all of this. So certainly, we're looking at our results, compared to competitive results. We see how \u2013 we look at our win/loss ratios and the businesses that we have, and they indicate to us that we're maintaining or gaining share across the business.\nJonathan Ho: Excellent. And then just as a follow-up, you outlined a number of customers in your examples that are buying a broader solution set. How do we think about ARR growth relative to either new customer acquisitions or upsell just given you can sell a broader suite of solutions today?\nRob Painter: Yeah. It's a good question, Jonathan. And we'll keep including examples from now on to show you these proof points around Connect & Scale. Like an example, we didn't put in the deck this quarter is a construction example. So, we sold two in our 400 customers a bundled offering last year. And in both of those examples, we were able to increase ARR 30% with each of those customers by virtue of creating a \u2013 essentially a one Trimble offering, making it a lot easier to do business with us. I mean that's the kind of \u2013 that's the evidence, as it were, of where we're going and why we're doing this. We see where we're going with Connect & Scale, giving us an ability to better connect the products we have to streamline customer experience and handoffs between the products and the workflows. That expands the value proposition of our offering. It increases and improves the user experience of the products. And along the way, we'll enhance our customer success operations to drive a deeper intimacy with our customers. And we believe that's going to provide our customers better value. They'll get that productivity, quality, safety, visibility, and sustainability out of using our solutions, and that's going to unlock ARR potential. I'll close by saying when we \u2013 as we prepared our plans for the year and looking at our strategies and our connected strategies, we're looking at the ARR opportunity from cross-selling and upselling and bundling. And we believe there's a lot of opportunity within our house.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg Capital.\nGal Munda: Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Guys, the first one, I would just like to ask you about this trend of the billings, you've basically seen deferred revenue growing ahead of ARR again, which kind of indicates the backlog is building up. And in terms of that, I just want to \u2013 wanted to see what's driving it? Is there any change in duration of the contract or anything or it's just the natural backlog buildup?\nDavid Barnes: Yeah. Gal, it's David. The biggest driver of deferred revenue and backlog is the growth of our recurring businesses. It's not a \u2013 it's actually \u2013 yes, it's not a meaningful change in the duration of contracts.\nGal Munda: Awesome. Thank you so much. And then the other question I had is considering the fact that obviously, professional services are under pressure in a year like this \u2013 like 2020 was, how are you thinking coming back from 2020 in terms of the professional services? Some companies have basically \u2013 it's definitely helped your gross margins in general. But my question is like, do you reassess how much services you have to provide in order to kind of protect that margin? Or are you quite happy for that revenue to come back as fast as it can? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Hi, Gal, this is Rob. I'll start and maybe David will want to add. I think pro services might be a tale of two halves in 2021, first half, second half. Look at the first half. I think that will probably mirror much of what we saw last year where it's difficult to, in many cases, get in to do the implementation. And we've done better and we're learning how to do it, but there are businesses that we have where the pro service is significantly challenged as a result. From a \u2013 impact on Trimble gross margins, we don't have that much pro serv. So, it's not really \u2013 it's not a fundamental driver of the gross margin at Trimble. I'm looking and thinking more about the revenue impact it would have than, let's say, a margin profile impact at a company level. David, do you see it [similar]?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. I think the only thing I'd add is that some of this is by designer, reflecting the mix shift of the business to more standardized offerings that require less professional services. But that said, what Rob said, some of our professional services business was highly constrained because we couldn't get access to the customer. So, it's a mix of both.\nGal Munda: Got it, okay. Thank you so much. Great results and good luck.\nDavid Barnes: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Blake Gendron from Wolfe Research.\nBlake Gendron: Yes, hey good evening. Thanks for squeezing me on here. My question was around just heightened investment levels for this digital transformation. Wondering if we can delineate, both on the CapEx side and maybe from an R&D perspective, how much is kind of due to this digital transformation. Then as we model it in the out-year, should we think of it over a fixed amount of time or are you essentially going to scale these investment levels with the receptivity of a cloud solution across the portfolio? Thanks.\nDavid Barnes: Yes. Hey Blake, it's David. This is definitely a multi-year effort. And I'll say of the OpEx increase that you can interpolate from our guidance, somewhere around $100 million year-on-year, about a quarter is in the broad category of the strategic investments, which is cloud infrastructure, digital transformation and autonomy. And we've got a lot of conviction around this. This is not all entirely incremental. We started this effort. It was more within divisions or pieces of the business, and now it's a company-wide effort. What we're doing is developing playbook with standard processes that enable cross-selling and a common digital experience across the business. We'll course-correct to see how well it goes. We've got a phased implementation process, but I do see this investment extending beyond this year.\nBlake Gendron: Understood. That's helpful. And then within that, as we think about something like data security, obviously, it's going to be important for your customers as they consider the move to the cloud. It's also going to be a fairly big cost, I would imagine, no matter what cloud application or a cloud platform you're running. So, how do you think about data security in terms of internalizing those costs versus maybe outsourcing those costs and kind of partnering with a third-party tier?\nRob Painter: Well, there's no question that we're spending more on cybersecurity. It's \u2013 these are the kind of existential issues that all of us in technology businesses face as we manage our customers' systems of record. So, it's incredibly important that we are world-class in the area of cybersecurity. Our spend is really OpEx. It's not CapEx-oriented today. It's primarily our own teams, but we will use third parties to do intrusion detection for an example \u2013 or it's best practice. So, we follow best practices, what you want to do with external firms. Of course, we use a lot of external technology but, right, you pay for that on an OpEx basis. It's not capitalized. The last thing I would say around the area of cyber is, as many threats as it provides, we also see it as an opportunity to distinguish ourselves. And the scope, the scale, the breadth of Trimble, we see as an advantage here because this is something customers are increasingly having to look at. And our ability to manage at scale and at this level of sophistication outstrips the ability of a smaller company to keep up and actually draw parallel to things like GDPR. And these are expensive endeavors, and our scale helps in that aspect of it.\nBlake Gendron: Awesome. Thanks for your time.\nRob Painter: Thank you.\nOperator: We have no questions at this time. Michael, you may continue.\nMichael Leyba: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Hello everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. In addition, please note that we will be comparing against the 2019 that had a 14th week in the fourth quarter. Let's start on Slide 2 with the three key messages we want to convey today. First, the customer ROI of our technology and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the fourth quarter. Our customer value proposition is rooted in productivity, quality, safety, visibility, and sustainability. We are pleased to announce that annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, while quarterly revenue grew 0.4% year-over-year to $830 million. Expanding gross margins and execution on costs led to adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, and we finished the year delivering a record $672 million of operating cash flow. Second, executing the Connect & Scale 2025 strategy remains our focus. We are working to connect stakeholders across industry lifecycles and to transform customer workflows, while simultaneously making ourselves easier to do business with. As leaders of the business, we take our responsibility seriously to be effective allocators of capital. To this end, we will continue to invest disproportionately in our cloud and autonomy capabilities, as well as in go-to-market efforts to support and enable our long-term growth opportunities. Third, our long-term market conviction remains strong. We believe the secular trends of digitization provide long-term tailwinds and we maintain our resolve to exit this crisis on a stronger competitive footing than we entered it. As we come into 2021, we are both cautious and humble to recognize market uncertainty and volatility, while also confident that we are on the right track. Comparisons against 2020, especially on a quarterly basis, will be difficult, if not irrelevant. We will reinstate guidance at an annual level, and David will walk you through the details. In addition, we anticipate hosting an Investor Day in the second half of the year to update stakeholders on our long-term strategy and business model. As I reflect back on our May 2018 Investor Day and put that into context of our fiscal year 2020, while revenue is clearly set back with the pandemic, we are ahead in most all other aspects. At the Investor Day, we targeted adjusted 2021 EBITDA at 23% to 24% of revenue. We closed 2020 at 25.3% EBITDA. We targeted 2021 software services and recurring revenue mix at 55% of total revenue. We closed 2020 at 58% of total revenue. We targeted the ratio of 2021 operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income at approximately 1.1 times. We closed 2020 at 1.2 times operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income. In July 2018, our net-debt-to-EBITA ratio stood above 3 times and we said we would de-lever below 2.5 times. Today, we stand at 1.6 times. We see these as important proof points that we are on the right strategic path that we can uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds to deliver value to our customers and that our asset light business model works. Turning to my commentary on the fourth quarter, we beat our own expectations in Buildings & Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities. We hit our expectations in Transportation. Broadly speaking, we have seen signs of an emerging construction led recovery. We are experiencing favorable market conditions in agriculture. We see our innovation and go-to-market execution driving positive outcomes, and at the end of the year we benefited from government stimulus measures along with customers catching up on work.  David will walk us through additional segment details. Turning to Slide 3, this shows Connect & Scale delivering customer ROI in Transportation and Agriculture. In Transportation, our Trimble Dispatch Advisor solutions bring capabilities across our portfolio together to get the right load on the right truck with the right driver; thereby improving planning, reducing empty miles, and improving utilization. In Agriculture, Zlatiya Agro is a large farm enterprise in Bulgaria that has adopted Trimble's Connected Farm ecosystem across 100 of their machines. This offering consists of our GFX750 Connected display, and Autopilot steering along with our AutoSync data exchange functionality. The connected offering improves planning, process automation, and cost optimization. I will close my commentary on Slide 4 with an ESG update, a topic of increasing importance to all of our stakeholders. As a purpose-driven company, our mission of industry transformation and our leadership culture provides a compelling ESG backdrop. In the area of environmental sustainability, I'll highlight that the primary positive impact of Trimble on greenhouse gas emission reductions and other environmental measures happens through customer application of our technology. For example, eliminating rework in construction, reducing fuel and water usage in all our end-markets, and minimizing use of herbicides and pesticides in agriculture. We are also committed to developing science-based targets to further our positive impact. In the area of people and social responsibility, I'll highlight that we ranked in the top 10% of companies for diversity in the Comparably survey. I'm also very proud of the work of the Trimble Foundation, where we contributed a record amount of money to put to work for our philanthropic efforts. Finally, in the area of corporate governance, our ratings with third-party firms like MSCI are strong, and we are committed to continuous improvement in our sustainability program. David, over to you. As we wrap up, I would like to thank the Trimble team and our global dealer partner network for their outstanding efforts throughout 2020. We entered the crisis with an objective to exit the crisis on a stronger competitive footing. I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2020 and the progress and commitment we are making towards our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. We enter 2021 with increased conviction in our ability to fulfill our mission to \u201cTransform the Way the World Works.\u201d Furthermore, I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Trimble's inclusion in the S&P 500 as of January 21, a milestone for Trimble's growth and global impact. Thank you to our customers, our global dealer partners, and our employees past and present for making this possible. It has been a remarkable 42-year journey as a company, and our best days are yet to come. Operator, let's please go to Q&A. Hi, Rob. Thanks, Rob. So if we look at the primary products that we offer in the agriculture market today, that would capture guidance, it would capture water management, it would include the variable rates, and then we also have the weed seeker product. So spot spray optimization, and then I would, you know, and then there's the software that we have. And so the strategy we have is the connected farm strategy in agriculture. So, just from an organic view of our product portfolio, we are bullish on the opportunities in agriculture to connect what we're doing together to create additional ROI for our customers. What we'll build on top of that is our autonomy strategy, and we see autonomy as a series of increasing levels of automation over the coming quarters and years to move us really more into that autonomous future. So, we believe we can do a lot of this organically. From an acquisition perspective, you know, we're certainly open if there's acquisitions that could help us accelerate our development and our efforts in any of those, any of those areas. Well, we've seen strong double-digit increases in the Weedseeker and the Weedseeker 2. So, yeah, we've seen strong increases and really think we're going to see them really for a while. We initially saw that the take rate being very high in South America and then we see that moving around the world. So Jason, this is Rob -- at the beginning of the year, we were tracking closer to an inverse of that, because we're really pretty early in the transformation of our enterprise business, so that bookings mix is pretty, actually exceeded our expectations of how quickly it has shifted to subscription offering. And when we do that 80/20 comparison, that's at a TCV or total contract value levels, right. So, we can do it on an apple-to-apple basis. In terms of measuring the progress of the business and how we measure and look at the proof points in the business, we'll certainly hit on the first one right away, which is the ratio of the of the bookings because that's what we're, you know, the strategy, the end game, from a financial model perspective is to build a recurring offering, and we're talking about the enterprise business because we already have that in our maps business. We already have that in our mobility business, and we really also have that in our shipper business. So, really it's an additive view of moving that direction. And finally, you asked about, you know, additional measures or metrics that we could report in transportation. I think we have an Investor Day. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're going to target for the second half of the year. I think it's \u2013 we just have to make sure we get the right ones to tell the right story. I'm as \u2013 I think, as much as anything showing proof points, like the customer examples, such as the example that was in one of the slides, is the kind of demonstrable evidence that I want to be able to continue to put forward to our investors. You're welcome. Sure. Hi, Ann, it's good to hear from you. So let's start in B&I if we run through the outlook, and what we're hearing from some of the different constituents throughout the chain. I'd start with saying that the outlook is pretty good. There are a few exceptions, but the outlook is pretty good. If we look at the type of work, infrastructure and residential backlogs are improving. EPC is down, so that's going to relate to oil and gas multi-sector, which picks up commercial work that looks flat to down, and not surprisingly retail is down and elements such as data centers and logistics centers are up. When we look at the public sector, the outlook is generally better than it was a quarter as you know the financing is in a stronger position. In January, the Dodge index was at its highest level since the pandemic started. Now, they did warn the recovery may be uneven in the coming months, which sounds about right. And at an OEM level, I would say the signals are mixed, so it is stronger and heavy equipment less so in the automotive space. So, in aggregate that outlook is a net positive. On the ARR front and B&I, really a very solid quarter, really the teams executed at an outstanding level in the quarter and for the year. Our net retention in businesses such as e-Builder and Viewpoint, they're well over a 100%. We had mid-teens ARR growth in Viewpoint and e-Builder. So, continued strong performance from those businesses and those operators. Did I miss anything Ann? The transportation business we see as strategic when we see it as attractive. We think we've got a favorable position and a favorable offering. And, you know, I think we have the, say the coverage of assets in this sector, which I think would be quite enviable from a competitive standpoint. So from the 20% level, that's absolutely the target that we have is to get this segment backup to the, I'll call it the company level of profitability. In terms of how we measure that, you know, given how much of the business is recurring, we'll also look at it from a customer lifetime value perspective. So, I'll be cautious to be overly dogmatic about the 20% so long as we're continuing to get the bookings and to grow the business \u2013 grow the business and get that trajectory. So, the first order of business is to be able to show that demonstrable trajectory, which we said, we feel like we'll be able to do towards the later part of the year, second half of the year. And as we've got that trajectory, I think that's going to give all of us the confidence in what we're doing. And you know, we'll look at measures such as lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition cost, because that's a very indicative measure of how the business progresses. And then from the broader, I'd say strategic lens of it, we'll continue to look at \u2013 be open to looking at assets or partnerships that help us further and accelerate the strategy. At a high level, it is [Kristin]. What I would augment from a measurement perspective is ARR growth. That is our primary focus of the, you know, the measurements out there. And that interplay, you know, between ARR, and the overall growth is important. So, I'll trade all day long. The top line revenue growth if it's going, if it's moderated because we're accelerating ARR and that's one that I think needs to rise higher in the pecking order. Sure, and I'll start by up leveling to the whole segment where we saw the outperformance come from a combination of three things: healthy demand, catch up in work, and the third is new products. So, in Europe, we know we think there's an anticipation of a construction led recovery tax incentives also helped, I should add. In North America, there's residential and from the new product innovation perspective our R12i GNSS receiver and the X7 scanner we think really led demand in all our markets. In North America specifically, and looking at residential, we see that as a near to mid-term catalyst, and then I would, you know, have an anticipation of normalization there. If we were to see, you know, more infrastructure work, then clearly our mix would shift or balance with the residential and infrastructure work. Historically, residential has not been a primary driver of the Trimble business. So, it certainly has been an accelerant, certainly from a percentage standpoint. We'll start with the question around cycle, because it tends not to be relevant in the Trimble context. It tends to be, you know, I would associate that to an industrial \u2013 a straight industrial context, and the fundamental nature of the markets that we're serving as their large global underserved and under penetrated by technology. So our correlation hasn't historically been very tight to cycles. So, I would really see the Trimble story as a secular story with a cyclical undertone. So, the cycle obviously has an impact, but a secular first cyclical undertone. From an expectation of, I think you asked about recovering turn, recovering business in the transportation market. Yes, we're very optimistic around that. I mean, that's table stakes, frankly. And we look at the pieces we have across the technology, landscape, and transportation, and we think we're in a favorite position. We've got over 90% of the top 100 trucking companies use our technology. We've got over a million powered assets. They're managed in the Trimble network. I look at the set of capabilities we have. We do telematics, video, ERP, maintenance, mapping, routing, navigation, analytics, visibility.  So, we have a strong set of capabilities. I believe it brings scale to the market. And when we look at Connect and Scale applied in the transportation context, that's where I think we've become really unique as if we can sell [outcome], we look at the bundled offerings. And then not only bundled offerings, but where we can provide unique value by stitching together our products. And that's actually why we put that slide as an example of Trimble dispatch advisor because into the slides is because that's an example where we're pulling capabilities across our tech stack into a uniquely Trimble \u2013 and to a unique Trimble offering. So, I hope that helps \u2013 give you context and let me know if I missed something. And Jerry, from acceleration perspective, within the business, I look at Buildings and Infrastructure and Transportation. So within Buildings and Infrastructure, you know, we're talking about our building construction businesses accelerating the subscription transformations there. We mentioned in transportation, for example, the 80/20, booking split subscription to perpetual that we're seeing in the enterprise business right now. So, there I would call those the model conversions that are accelerating. And, you know, that's separate from businesses that you already know, like the viewpoints in builders and construction that continue to demonstrate strong growth. And then the last thing I would mention is, on the hardware side, you know, we are in very early days, but you know, early days of the \u2013 essentially it's the hard ways of service, we call it Trimble platform as a service in the civil construction phase. Hey Jerry, I characterize our M&A pipeline as being open for business. We have the confidence to assert our strategy, and we have the balance sheet to support it. As it relates to the, I'd say the opportunities themselves within the pipeline. I would say they're decent. I wouldn't say they're like overly robust. And on the other side there, you know, it's also not non-existent. So, I'd say it's a decent pipeline. And when we look at that pipeline, we certainly have a bias. You know, we think about that with a bias, well it's more than a bias, the imperative is to support the Connect and Scale strategy. The bias, then within supporting the strategy is certainly towards software assets. But David also mentioned, you know, from a \u2013 linking it to capital allocation, where we're spending on the digital transformation, we look at capabilities and cloud, we look at capabilities and autonomy, for example. And so autonomy is another area that I would, you know put on that list, and I wouldn't \u2013 it doesn't classically define a software. Hey, Rick. Organic ARR was actually up a little bit. We should have a business, but yeah, organics improved a little bit. Nope. I'm pulling out the business. Hey, Rick, if you just be careful, you're looking at the 14th week impact. Because the recurring revenue, just take that piece of the P&L. That has an 8% impact. Yeah. So organic was up 7 in the Q4, and we said we'd end the year, our guidance is high-single-digits. So, faster than we are now, sequentially improving through the year for all the reasons I mentioned: organic growth of our existing offerings, the transitions and improvement of transportation. Yeah, you've got the key factors. So, the conversions are there. And then OpEx, as I mentioned, is growing faster than revenue. Some of that is just replacing costs that that sort of naturally came out during the COVID period. So, we will have higher incentive compensation expense. We anticipate that we'll begin to travel later in the year. A lot of the things we do normally including hiring were really low. And we are investing, as Rob said in the cloud and digital transformation. And then I'll add that part of the OpEx increase is FX because the U.S. dollars weaken. So, over half of our business is outside the U.S. so that naturally causes OpEx to grow. Inventories are low. Yeah. Hi Jonathan, I see it in a few areas. One would be through innovation. And so an example we talked about in geospatial is with the R12i and the X7, so the right demonstrable evidence that the investment in R&D is producing new products. And we've seen that in Ag with Weedseeker. As an example, we've seen it in Buildings and Infrastructure with the model conversions, a lot of innovation actually happening there and creating some derivative opportunities in areas such as analytics, for example. And the other place where I see us coming out of \u2013 stronger is from an organizational culture perspective. Okay, that's hard to, let's say, measure as it relates to share gains or the other aspects. But I really think when you look at our employee engagement it's in a very strong place. We look at the retention of our people. We're doing well there. We look at \u2013 I talked to \u2013 used an example in the prepared remarks around how we've ranked in diversity and inclusion score. So, we see the culture in a strong place. And then from a share gain aspect, how all of this relates to, let's say, share gains in our competitive position, it's \u2013 I have to admit it's notoriously difficult to be very specific on share gains in our markets. It's just really not a lot of good data. So, you can't \u2013 you really can't find like the singular report that's going to tell you all of this. So certainly, we're looking at our results, compared to competitive results. We see how \u2013 we look at our win/loss ratios and the businesses that we have, and they indicate to us that we're maintaining or gaining share across the business. Yeah. It's a good question, Jonathan. And we'll keep including examples from now on to show you these proof points around Connect & Scale. Like an example, we didn't put in the deck this quarter is a construction example. So, we sold two in our 400 customers a bundled offering last year. And in both of those examples, we were able to increase ARR 30% with each of those customers by virtue of creating a \u2013 essentially a one Trimble offering, making it a lot easier to do business with us. I mean that's the kind of \u2013 that's the evidence, as it were, of where we're going and why we're doing this. We see where we're going with Connect & Scale, giving us an ability to better connect the products we have to streamline customer experience and handoffs between the products and the workflows. That expands the value proposition of our offering. It increases and improves the user experience of the products. And along the way, we'll enhance our customer success operations to drive a deeper intimacy with our customers. And we believe that's going to provide our customers better value. They'll get that productivity, quality, safety, visibility, and sustainability out of using our solutions, and that's going to unlock ARR potential. I'll close by saying when we \u2013 as we prepared our plans for the year and looking at our strategies and our connected strategies, we're looking at the ARR opportunity from cross-selling and upselling and bundling. And we believe there's a lot of opportunity within our house. Hi, Gal, this is Rob. I'll start and maybe David will want to add. I think pro services might be a tale of two halves in 2021, first half, second half. Look at the first half. I think that will probably mirror much of what we saw last year where it's difficult to, in many cases, get in to do the implementation. And we've done better and we're learning how to do it, but there are businesses that we have where the pro service is significantly challenged as a result. From a \u2013 impact on Trimble gross margins, we don't have that much pro serv. So, it's not really \u2013 it's not a fundamental driver of the gross margin at Trimble. I'm looking and thinking more about the revenue impact it would have than, let's say, a margin profile impact at a company level. David, do you see it [similar]? Well, there's no question that we're spending more on cybersecurity. It's \u2013 these are the kind of existential issues that all of us in technology businesses face as we manage our customers' systems of record. So, it's incredibly important that we are world-class in the area of cybersecurity. Our spend is really OpEx. It's not CapEx-oriented today. It's primarily our own teams, but we will use third parties to do intrusion detection for an example \u2013 or it's best practice. So, we follow best practices, what you want to do with external firms. Of course, we use a lot of external technology but, right, you pay for that on an OpEx basis. It's not capitalized. The last thing I would say around the area of cyber is, as many threats as it provides, we also see it as an opportunity to distinguish ourselves. And the scope, the scale, the breadth of Trimble, we see as an advantage here because this is something customers are increasingly having to look at. And our ability to manage at scale and at this level of sophistication outstrips the ability of a smaller company to keep up and actually draw parallel to things like GDPR. And these are expensive endeavors, and our scale helps in that aspect of it. Thank you."

            "name": "David Barnes",
            "content": "Thanks Rob. Let's begin on Slide 5, with a review of fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter total revenue was $830 million on a non-GAAP basis, up 0.4% year-over-year. To break that down, currency translation added 1% and acquisitions, net of divestitures, were essentially neutral. Organic growth, excluding the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2019, was approximately 2%. ARR, or annualized recurring revenue grew to $1.30 billion in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year, and was up 7% on an organic basis. Organic ARR growth, excluding the Transportation segment was up 15%. Adjusted EBITDA, which includes income from our joint ventures and equity investments, was $217 million with a margin of 26.1%, reflecting both strong gross margins and continuing low operating costs. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 16%, down 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Net income was up 16% and non-GAAP earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.61, up 15% year-over-year. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $188 million, up 54% year-over-year, while cash flow from operations for the full-year was $672 million, up 15% versus 2019. Free cash flow, which we defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures, was $177 million for the quarter, up 64% year-over-year, and $615 million for the year, up 19% versus 2019. Note that on a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was approximately 1.2 times non-GAAP net income. Our strong cash flow results reflect the combination of higher profit and improved working capital efficiency. With a strong cash flow in the quarter, we continued to de-lever. At year-end, our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 1.6 times. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with flexibility to consider a range of capital allocation options. We expect to continue to de-lever and pursue modest share buybacks, while having dry powder deployable for attractive acquisition opportunities. Turning to Page 6, I'd like to highlight one of the key drivers of our cash flow in the quarter, working capital. Our working capital efficiency has improved over the last 5 years. We ended the year with just over zero net working capital. This progress was driven by a number of factors, including the growth in deferred revenue from our recurring revenue businesses, reduced [days sales outstanding] of accounts receivable, and lower inventory levels. Turning now to Slide 7, I'll review in a bit more detail our fourth quarter revenue trends. As I mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our non-recurring revenue streams also grew, driven by a strong rebound in hardware sales in geospatial, civil construction, and agriculture. From a geographic perspective, North America revenues were down 8%, driven by declines in our Transportation business. Revenues in North America from businesses other than Transportation grew 2%. Europe revenues were up 9%, reflecting catch-up on project activity slowed earlier in 2020 and fiscal stimulus measures. Asia Pacific was the best performer in the quarter, up 13%, driven by strong performance in Japan. The Rest of World, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 10% year-over-year driven principally by strong demand from the agricultural sector. Now turning to Slide 8, I'll review briefly our full-year results. Revenue for the full-year 2020 contracted 4% overall and 5% organically. Gross margins for the year expanded 140 basis points, and EBITDA grew 7% on a year-over-year basis. EBITDA margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3%. Operating income grew 7% year-over-year, and operating income margins expanded 220 basis points to 22.8%. Net income was up 12% and earnings per share were $2.23, up 12% year-over-year. Next, on Slide 9, we highlight a number of key metrics, which collectively give a good picture of the state of our business. I'll highlight a few metrics, which neither Rob nor I have already mentioned. In this year of strong margins, we continued to spend over 15% of our revenue in research and development, reflecting our continued investment in areas of strategic importance during the downturn. We ended the year with a backlog of $1.3 billion, up 11% from year ago levels. Our deferred revenue at the end of the year was $614 million, up 13% from the end of 2019. The health of our backlog and deferred revenue point to improved visibility for revenue growth heading into 2021. Turning now to Slide 10, let's go through the fourth quarter revenue details at the reporting segment level. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 1% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of last year's extra week, organic revenue for the segment would have been up approximately 4%. Revenue growth was double digit in both our SketchUp and Civil hardware businesses. Segment margins were up 90 basis points due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 14% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core surveying and mapping business. Revenue was up in all regions, aided by successful new products, stimulus-driven activity, and healthy project tender levels as projects which were delayed earlier in 2020 came back on line. Margins were up over 9 percentage points, due to a combination of higher margin revenue mix, lower levels of discounting, and strong cost control. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis, driven principally by our precision agriculture business. Revenue growth was strongest outside the U.S., with higher commodity prices, stimulus programs, favorable weather, and a strong reception to our new products all contributing to growth in the quarter. Solid performance by our Cityworks business, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of last year, also contributed to segment revenue in the quarter. Margins expanded over 5 percentage points, driven by operating cost control. Transportation revenue was down 22% on an organic basis. Excluding the impact of the 14th week in the fourth quarter of 2019, organic revenues were down by about 19%. Operating margins were down over 8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Our fourth quarter financial performance in Transportation reflects many of the same factors we have discussed in prior quarters. Customer attrition in our mobility business since late 2019 accounts for the majority of the adverse development in segment revenue, ARR, and margins. On that front there is some good news, as our product performance has improved and customer churn has declined sequentially in each of the last three quarters. Note that the ongoing subscription transition in our Transportation enterprise software business [to press revenue] trends in the quarter, and the Kuebix acquisition had an expected dilutive impact on segment margins. While we have more work ahead of us to improve the performance of this business, we continue to believe in the power of our connected Transportation strategy and project the steps the team is taking now will yield improved performance later in 2021. Turning now to Page 11, I'd like to share with you our outlook for this year. Our planning efforts have settled on a 2021 financial outlook based on a number of key assumptions. First, we assume that public health initiatives are successful in enabling a broad re-opening of constrained sectors of the economy by mid-year 2021. Second, our plan is rooted in the assumption that the economy grows through the year, with 2021 GDP at least recovering to 2019 levels. Third, our projections exclude the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures. Our most important key performance indicator will continue to be ARR. We expect organic ARR growth to end 2021 in the high-single-digit range, with sequential improvement as the quarter's progress. ARR growth in 2021 will be driven by the combination of organic growth of our existing recurring offerings, ongoing transitions from perpetual software products, and the gradual turnaround of our Transportation business. We project organic revenue growth in 2021 in the mid-single-digit range, with an additional 1-2 points if exchange rates remain near where they are today. That translates to a revenue range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Note that our revenue growth in 2021 will be negatively impacted by approximately 150 basis points from our subscription model transitions. We anticipate that EBITDA and operating margins in 2021 will be higher than 2019, but lower than 2020. Overall our gross margins this year are projected to remain stable with 2020 levels. But a number of factors are likely to cause EBITDA margins to come down somewhat when compared to the historically high levels of 2020. First, the return to a more normalized level of incentive compensation, and in the second half of this year, higher travel costs will naturally cause operating costs to grow at a rate faster than revenue. Second, we are incrementally allocating more capital in both CapEx and operating expense to the areas of focus in our Connect & Scale strategy: namely digital transformation, cloud infrastructure, and autonomy. Third, our margins will be negatively impacted by the accelerated subscription model conversions of 150 basis points. I'll note that we project income from equity method investments to be approximately $35 million to $40 million, and net interest expense to be about $65 million to $70 million with decreasing levels as the year progresses. We project our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 17%, and that our shares outstanding will be approximately 254 million. Incorporating all of these factors, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 for the full-year. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to project that operating cash flow and free cash flow will exceed net income, as the favorable cash characteristics of our business will continue. Nevertheless, cash flow will likely be flat or decline modestly from 2020 levels, as we saw extraordinary improvement in working capital in late 2020. A few words on the segment dynamics in our outlook: Generally we expect that each of our segments will mirror the trends I have just described, although I'll highlight a few factors specific to the individual segments. In Buildings & Infrastructure, our hardware offerings were most adversely impacted by COVID in the second quarter of 2020, so we expect growth in the second quarter of 2021 to be very strong. Our Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities businesses have a lot of momentum now and we anticipate that momentum to generate strong growth through the first half of the year with more moderate growth thereafter. In Transportation, we don't expect to see meaningful revenue growth or margin improvement until late in 2021. We don't intend to provide quarterly guidance at this point. But I'll offer a few comments on factors that will influence our revenue and margin performance as the year progresses. Year-on-year growth in each quarter will obviously be impacted by the COVID-driven swings we have seen in 2020. We expect to grow in all four quarters, with the strongest growth rate in the second quarter, when we lap the worst period of the COVID crisis. We expect that operating and EBITDA margins will be relatively constant across the quarters. Rob, back to you for closing comments. Hi, [Kristin] it's David Barnes. So, as you pointed out, a meaningful portion of the increase in year-on-year operating expenditure will be really centered on the Connect and Scale strategy. So, we have a major initiative underway to accelerate our digital transformation. There's technology and process changes that will enable us to fulfill the potential we have to sell integrated offerings to customers, and we have a major push there. So, our CapEx, which was in the past two years more focused on facilities is this year very much focused on digital transformation, and cloud infrastructure as well, which will enable us to enhance our position as a world-class provider, integrated cloud based services. So that's where the focus of our investment is. Yeah, hey, James. It's David. Part of what you saw with the perpetual business is, we had meaningful slowdown in earlier quarters, as you'll know. So there's \u2013 some of that is catch up on projects that were delayed. Overall, the perpetual sales will obviously be \u2013 there will be pressure on that from the subscription transition. So, over time, in many of our businesses, the significant majority, we will be selling recurring rather than perpetual licenses for those businesses where a recurring model is viable. Hi Chad, it's David. The 150 basis points is more than 2020, probably about half again more. So, we're closer to 100 basis points. And that does reflect that in some of the businesses where there's a clear near term opportunity to make the transition. We anticipate making major progress this year. A little early to call [2022] on that. So, I'll resist the temptation, although we are, at that point getting past the valley for many of the subscription businesses, and we'll see more revenue uptick from that than we will this year. Hey, Jerry, I'll do the second question first, and then hand it over to rob. So, I think I've got your question, right. The 150 basis points, what we're saying there is that if we weren't doing the next round of transitions, our revenue would be 150 basis points higher, and that nearly all flows to operating income, because the margin is very high. Yeah. Gal, it's David. The biggest driver of deferred revenue and backlog is the growth of our recurring businesses. It's not a \u2013 it's actually \u2013 yes, it's not a meaningful change in the duration of contracts. Yes. I think the only thing I'd add is that some of this is by designer, reflecting the mix shift of the business to more standardized offerings that require less professional services. But that said, what Rob said, some of our professional services business was highly constrained because we couldn't get access to the customer. So, it's a mix of both. Thank you. Yes. Hey Blake, it's David. This is definitely a multi-year effort. And I'll say of the OpEx increase that you can interpolate from our guidance, somewhere around $100 million year-on-year, about a quarter is in the broad category of the strategic investments, which is cloud infrastructure, digital transformation and autonomy. And we've got a lot of conviction around this. This is not all entirely incremental. We started this effort. It was more within divisions or pieces of the business, and now it's a company-wide effort. What we're doing is developing playbook with standard processes that enable cross-selling and a common digital experience across the business. We'll course-correct to see how well it goes. We've got a phased implementation process, but I do see this investment extending beyond this year."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Third Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Sir, please go ahead. \nRob Painter: Hello, everyone and thanks for taking the time to be with us today. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. We'll start on slide 2 with the four key messages we want to convey today. First, the resilience of our team, the quality of our strategy and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the third quarter. ARR grew 10% year-over-year to $1.26 billion, while quarterly revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $793 million. Expanding gross margins and execution on costs led to adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.8%. Our shift to a more hardware connected, software centric and recurring revenue business model is working. I want to express my gratitude to the Trimble team, who continues to perform strongly under these challenging conditions, as well as our customers and investors for your continued support and confidence in Trimble. Second, executing on the Connect & Scale 2025 strategy remains our focus. We are working to connect stakeholders and industry lifecycle data to improve and transform customer workflows. The business model transitions are an output of this strategy, not an input. Third, we continue to put organizational elements in place to enable the strategy. Most recently we have named James Dalton, as our newest Board member; and we promoted from within to hire a Chief People Officer, a Chief Digital Officer, a VP of Talent & Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and a Head of Sustainability. Fourth, our long-term conviction remains strong. We will balance cost containment and investment in innovation during the downturn. On one hand, we've reduced our cost base in transportation in the quarter. On the other hand, we continue to increase our investments in autonomy and digital transformation. We maintain our goal to exit this recession on a stronger competitive footing than we entered it; and on that note, we are in a more proactive mode of looking for acquisition opportunities, which will advance our Connect & Scale strategy. At the reporting segment level, a few strategic comments to make. In Buildings & Infrastructure, we saw better-than-expected results in civil construction machine control and guidance. In addition, our software businesses delivered a strong level of recurring revenue growth. In Geospatial, innovation is sparking demand. Our end customers have been getting back to work and catching up on project activity. In Resources & Utilities, the agriculture market has been resilient. In North America, for example, commodity prices have risen, while direct support payments to farmers remain well above historical averages. Markets such as Australia, Japan and Brazil all performed well in the quarter. These overall favorable conditions combined with the compelling ROI on investing in precision agriculture have contributed to our growth in 2020. In Transportation, we took several meaningful steps, which we believe will position the business for better performance in the quarters and years ahead. We implemented a substantial restructuring in the business during the third quarter, which will lower our ongoing fixed operating costs. Further, we made business plan decisions which resulted in an inventory charge in the third quarter. With these difficult decisions behind us, we can now see the path for improved performance in 2021 as compared to the second half of 2020. At the macro level, market conditions have begun to improve in the transportation market with higher asset utilization, improved spot prices and increasing capital investment. Overall, we are cautiously optimistic that market conditions will support sustained growth for Trimble through 2021. As we move from election mode to governing mode we will follow decisions on stimulus measures, especially, infrastructure and local government funding and policy decisions relating to trade and tax. Let me now turn the call over to David for a review of the numbers. \nDavid Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's begin on slide 3 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $793 million, up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Net of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange fluctuations organic revenue declined 1%. Gross margin in the third quarter was 58.8% up 180 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by improved revenue mix and also assisted by lower discounting and new products with higher margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, up 380 basis points year-over-year, a result of both gross margin expansion and cost reduction. Cost reduction was driven by structural actions and temporary factors related to COVID-19. Operating income margins also expanded 360 basis points to 24.2%. Net income dollars increased by 26% on a year-over-year basis, while earnings per share increased by $0.12 to $0.60 per share. Turning to slide 4. Our third quarter cash flow from operations was $181 million, reflecting the strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow represented approximately 1.2 times non-GAAP net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $165 million. We paid down over $150 million of net debt in the quarter and the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1.9 times. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $184 million in cash. In addition, we have no scheduled principal payments on our debt, until July 2022. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. Next on slide 5, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Annualized recurring revenue, which as a reminder includes the annualized value of term licenses was $1.26 billion in the third quarter, up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Organic growth of ARR was 6%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble organic ARR grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter. Net working capital inclusive of deferred revenue represents approximately 1% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis demonstrating the asset-light nature of our business model. We continue to proactively manage our costs, while maintaining investment in key initiatives. Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was nearly 15% of revenue. Two additional metrics that we follow are deferred revenue and backlog. Our deferred revenue was up 20% on a year-over-year basis through a combination of organic and acquisition-related growth and our backlog was $1.2 billion, up more than 10% versus prior year. These two metrics give us additional visibility into the future revenue trends in the quarters ahead. Turning to slide 6. Recurring revenues made up 37% of total Trimble revenue in the quarter compared to 35% a year ago. We experienced recurring revenue growth, across a wide range of businesses. Even in a tough economic environment, these offerings are essential to the operation of our customers' businesses. Our non-recurring revenues, including hardware perpetual software and professional services, experienced a year-over-year decline of about 2% in the quarter. Performance in these areas was helped by strength in our Geospatial and agriculture businesses, offset by expected weak performance in Transportation. Overall, our professional service trends improved somewhat in the quarter from the beginning of the COVID crisis, but are still negatively impacted by lack of access to our customers' facilities and employees. In terms of geography, North America was down 5% representing a sequential improvement when compared to the second quarter, which was down 17%. Revenues in North America were adversely impacted by the declines in our Transportation business. Excluding Transportation, revenue in North America grew over 2% year-over-year in the third quarter. Europe was up 9%, reflecting broad-based improvement in project activity across the continent. Asia Pacific was once again the best performer in the quarter up 16%. Agriculture was a bright spot in Asia Pacific in the quarter as Australia recovered from a multiyear drought and the Japanese government implemented increased direct support of farmers. Our business in China, while still small grew year-on-year in the third quarter as the country recovered from the easing of COVID-related shutdowns. Turning now to slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 1% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in our software businesses. Segment margins were up nearly four percentage points, due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 7% on an organic basis, driven principally by increased sales to OEM customers. Revenue from sales of system to the surveying and mapping sector was essentially flat versus prior year, a meaningful improvement from the second quarter when revenues were down nearly 20% year-on-year. Margins were up over 11 percentage points due to a combination of higher-margin revenue mix, compelling new products, lower levels of discounting and strong cost control. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 16% on an organic basis. We benefited from double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture, positioning services and agriculture software offerings. M&A growth also played a role in the segment growth in the quarter as the integration of Cityworks has added significant capability to our offerings for utilities and local governments. Margins expanded over 7 percentage points, driven by improved revenue mix strong profitability from M&A and cost control. While top line results in Transportation were consistent with our expectations coming into the quarter, the business performed well below our long-term objectives. Segment revenue was down 21% on an organic basis and margins declined over 10 percentage points. The drivers of revenue and margin decline are broadly consistent with those we highlighted in our last earnings call. The rate of revenue decline did improve in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter as did customer retention. Profitability in the quarter was impacted by lower revenue subscription transition and M&A as well as an inventory charge that we took in the mobility business. Turning now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We continue to face significant uncertainty in market demand across the industry sectors we serve. With the rate of COVID-19 infection increasing in many countries, our customers face renewed risks of work restrictions stemming from governmental rules to curb the spread of the virus. And the pace of the recovery in the broader economy remains uncertain. As a result, we still don't have sufficient clarity in the end-user demand to enable us to give guidance. As we did last quarter, we will provide some color on the most important trends which will drive our performance. Starting with revenue. I'll remind you that our fiscal year 2019 had an extra week. The lack of the 14th week this quarter will adversely impact overall Trimble revenue growth by approximately $23 million or about 3%. In this quarter, we will enjoy less benefit from projects deferred at the onset of the pandemic last spring. Finally, the combination of lapping our Cityworks acquisition from the fourth quarter of 2019 and the recent divestiture of Construction Logistics resulted in less favorable inorganic revenue growth momentum. Considering all of these factors, we anticipate that total Trimble revenue will be down modestly versus prior year in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless we expect that our recurring revenue businesses will remain robust with organic ARR growth in line with third quarter 2020 performance. Note again that Cityworks, which is principally a recurring term license business, was part of Trimble for much of the fourth quarter in 2019. From a segment perspective, Resources and Utilities revenue will continue to grow in the fourth quarter albeit at a more modest rate as we lap the strong fourth quarter of last year. Transportation revenues are likely to decline at a rate comparable to what we experienced in the third quarter. The Geospatial and Buildings and Infrastructure segments are likely to see revenue trends at about the company average. Turning to gross margins. We expect margins roughly flat versus prior year in the fourth quarter. The extra week in the fourth quarter of last year did boost margins and we won't have that positive impact in this quarter. Separate from this factor, though, we do expect gross margins to continue their strong performance driven by software mix, new products and reduced discounting. Our operating expenses will grow modestly in the quarter, up approximately $20 million sequentially from the third quarter. With our improved performance outlook for the year, we anticipate higher incentive compensation and we are seeing a gradual increase in discretionary spending across areas where spending was unsustainably low due to COVID restrictions. Assuming the revenue and margin dynamics I've described, we expect to manage to decremental margins in the low to mid-30s. Finally, I will note that we project continued healthy cash flow generation. With our leverage now at our long-term target we have reinstituted a modest share repurchase program. We will continue to employ a disciplined approach to capital allocation as we manage our capital structure and invest for the future. With that, I will turn it over to Rob to conclude.\nRob Painter: Let me close by turning to slide 9 and reinforcing how we progressed against our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy in the quarter. First, connecting solutions across our industry lifecycles. Two examples to share. In Construction, we released WorksOS, which integrates design data from the office with machine control data to deliver real-time progress and productivity updates for the entire jobsite. Slide 10 shows a visual of how Trimble is transforming workflows in construction by connecting the physical and digital worlds. This is how we bring together the office and the field with our hardware and software, in a unique Trimble way. Today, we put a constructible digital engineering model on the blade of construction equipment. With WorksOS, we can dynamically bring back surface data and view progress to plan. In essence, this workflow positions us to take the 3D constructible model and next add dimensions of cost and schedule to create a 5D model. From here we will integrate this enriched model into the construction ERP system with additional, financial and asset management views. The aggregation of all this data, coupled with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is a further step towards an autonomous future. Back to slide 9 and another example from construction, we launched augmented reality into our Trimble earthworks machine control and guidance solution. Augmented reality is available in the cab of the excavator, which helps operators more easily understand 3D models, cut/fill information, slope data and other reference points. Second; delivering breakout innovation. Two examples to share. In Geospatial, our new GNSS receiver, the R12i, has been a market success. The innovation in the GNSS receiver is the integration of inertial technology that enables robust tilt compensation. What this means is that the surveyor can work productively and effectively in challenging environments. We are making our customers\u2019 work easier. The second example is highlighted on slide 11. Our structural BIM software is used for many types of materials and projects. This past month, the team announced the winners of our 2020 BIM awards. On this slide you will see the winners for best infrastructure and best commercial projects. A closer look reveals that these projects deliver more than just incredibly detailed design visualization. What these engineering teams are delivering are the precise specifications needed to automate fabrication for each individual component, as well as instructions for assembling those complex designs in the field. This is what we call \u201cConstructible Design\u201d and these two projects are exemplary. Third; accelerating our business model transformation. In Construction, we sold our first Platform-as-a-Service offering in our civil construction business. We are delivering technology assurance for our customers while integrating construction cloud services and world-class support to keep our customers\u2019 operations current and optimized. Fourth; we are taking actions that enable us to efficiently and effectively scale our business. Last week we closed on the divestiture of our construction logistics business; and in the third quarter we completed the acquisition of a business that further expands our positioning services network to now cover over one million square miles in North America. We are making decisions and investments in the area of cloud enablement, data management, and artificial intelligence that are connected in approach, which will enable us to scale to meet the opportunity ahead of us. With that, I\u2019d like to thank everyone for taking the time to be with us today, and a special thank you to our global Trimble colleagues. Operator, let\u2019s please go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg Capital. Your line is now open.\nGal Munda: Hello. Thanks for taking my question. I've got the first one. Just wanted to follow-up on the strong ARR growth, which kind of continued in this quarter. And what I was wondering is, if you can talk a little bit more around the growth drivers of the ARR as in how much is the organic expansions and new customers you're seeing versus how much it is the business model transition of on one side having lower licenses. Yeah that's kind of my first question. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Hi, Gal, welcome back.\nGal Munda: Thank you.\nRob Painter: As it relates to the ARR growth in the quarter, so 10% at a total company level around 6% at an organic level. If we exclude the Transportation business, we'd be in the double-digit growth on ARR including in the construction business, so in the Buildings and Infrastructure reporting segment. In terms of the breakdown between new customers and existing customers it's both is the short answer where we've seen growth. So we are figuring out a way to sell into new logo customers in this digital environment. So we take a business such as the SketchUp business ARR grew almost actually 50% -- more than 50% year-over-year. And that's clearly coming from an expansion of the addressable market and winning new logos seeing the same thing in the Viewpoint business. Having said that like compared to let's say a prepandemic level it is there is a greater weight towards penetration of existing customers at the total portfolio level and I think it's probably for the obvious reasons. Does that help? \nGal Munda: That's very helpful. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned your strategic -- one of the strategic levers is connecting the industry life cycles and you talked a little bit more specific about the construction. What I'm wondering is, when you start connecting those dots which previously were kind of best of breed versus now best of suite and you're becoming more of a suite of products, are you finding yourself -- how does that relate to the average contract size that you'd be seeing the sales cycles? And potentially, do you have a new buying center within those companies that you previously sold maybe one tool to someone else there?\nRob Painter: So if I say -- I'll use construction as the example. And you're right. I mean the connect part of the Connect & Scale strategy is absolutely to connect stakeholders data solutions across the industry life cycle, whether it's construction agriculture transportation utilities forestry. To give you an example in construction, we can see -- for example if I just take the Viewpoint business discretely which is the construction management system that system of record for the construction company we've had over $1.5 million of new ACV in the last 12 months. And this is really a customer pull. We're really early I would say in the Trimble push of the strategy. So customer pool essentially to create suites or bundles of solutions to connect into that system of record. So for example -- and construction telematics, the information on asset utilization that can augment job cost which is in the ERP. If we look at our structural business, fabrication management that ties into the material estimates which are in the back office software. If we look at the MEP or mechanical electrical plumbing business, we have there we see the integration of estimating, pricing, change, management job cost and procurement into that system of record. So we're seeing real examples where our customers are asking us to integrate the various Trimble technologies that they have. And we're starting to see a few more new logo wins as a result of being able to come in as a unified face to that customer. In terms of who we sell to in that new model a recent example with an ENR 400 customer who made a significant commitment to Trimble. I was with the CIO. So it starts to look more like C-level when we're up-leveling the sale to an overall Trimble sale. Clearly that correlates to the contract sizes. So let's say as opposed to three, 3 four separate contracts which could be in the tens or low hundreds of thousands each right it starts to become over on a total contract value basis they start to look more like $1 million type deals as where we're heading with it. \nGal Munda: That\u2019s great, very helpful. Thank you so much and congrats on a great quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is now open.\nRichard Eastman: Thank you and thanks for the questions. Rob, just first off, I just wanted to ask maybe throw a little bit more color around the Transportation side of the business and maybe how you're viewing this quarter. It sounds like you took some structural costs out of the business in the quarter. But from a revenue and op margin basis, I mean clearly this would suggest maybe a bottom in both of those metrics. And do you see this business starting to form the basis of some growth in 2021 once we get through the year here from a revenue perspective? \nRob Painter: Rick so I think it's pretty similar narrative to what we had last quarter. I'll start by saying we did meet the topline expectations we have so it's clearly below our long-term ambition. But just to establish I'd say credibility that we can hit the number that we put forward as a starting point there at the topline. What's similar to the narrative from last quarter that holds is we expect that the moves that we're making now we'll see the fruit of that in margin expansion into I'll say the second half of next year. We'll see that more in the second half of next year than the first half. The nature of the recurring revenue business is that it does take a while for that engine to get going. And when it gets going it becomes a cumulative game from that point. So, really a similar view and -- but I think you characterized it well upfront. \nRichard Eastman: Okay. And then just as a follow-up my other question. Just when I look at the hardware revenue in the third quarter, obviously, lots of noise around the second quarter. But I'm curious it did improve double-digits kind of 13% sequentially. Is there any message in there other than the second quarter was really bad? But is there any message in kind of the double-digit sequential rebound on the hardware side of the business just as a basis for follow-on software sales?\nDavid Barnes: Hey Richard, it's David Barnes. I'll offer up a couple of observations. Part of what we did benefit from is catching up on projects that got stalled or delayed in Q2. So, that helped. But that's not all of it. As Rob mentioned we've had a lot of innovation in the Geospatial area which is improving revenue trends and margins by the way. And so -- and we're seeing some -- it's hard to draw a trend in these noisy times, but some improvement in a number of our hardware areas that you're right bring software with it. So a bit of all three.\nRichard Eastman: Okay, very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAnn Duignan: Hi, good afternoon. Maybe Rob you could provide some color on the fundamentals around the different end markets. You usually give us some good color in terms of how you're thinking about construction activity from a more macro standpoint particularly now that we most likely won't get a large infrastructure bill. And then similarly on Transportation at least what -- the fundamentals have improved. We've seen a huge increase in truck orders. So, I'm just wondering how you're feeling about the fundamentals specifically in both those industries. Thanks.\nRob Painter: Sure. Hi Ann. So, I'll start with the Buildings and Infrastructure and do a little bit of a walk around the stakeholders. I think the logical place to start would be with the owners. And I'll use -- I'll start in the U.S. thinking about state DOTs or Department of Transportations as owners. And I would say the DOTs have been more resilient than we expected. And so that's been a good thing. So that would be a comment on a large owner segment. If I go next to architecture and when we look at the indicators the ABI is still below 50. Now, we saw September looks more encouraging than the numbers did in August. So, I think the ABI is helpful for macro health. But when we look at our actual architecture and design business it's meaningless because that's the business where we saw ARR up almost 50% year-over-year. If we go to civil construction and I'll stay in North America for a little bit. Civil contractors what we saw is a decrease in backlog with civil contractors, but an increase in backlog with civil engineers. And so that would suggest an initial recovery that could flow through to the contractors. If we look at our Viewpoint business where we could see the system of record for general contractors again confirm that some bookings are slowing and some of the velocity of hiring has been lower as compared to 2019. When we look outside the U.S., if we take construction PMI that shows a mixed view forward with the number of markets expecting expansion next year with I'd say an emphasis on Europe, when I quote construction PMI numbers. We also look at a basket of backlog at some of the largest construction companies in North America and Europe. And what we see there is that \u2013 and this is not surprising, we see that residential is doing well. Commercial's down. EPC and infrastructure have been down a little bit. So what we see, if I try to summarize that is, we see some of the end market work moving around. I would say, the numbers we see today are unambiguously better than what we saw in that March, April, May time frame. What's conflicting are the signals on sustained demand, and I think I would close on that, one by saying, what we do feel is that there is unequivocal demand for digitization and improved access to information. So we think at the secular level, we're in the right place. And if I go to Transportation, and I probably could start actually with some of the research you had we certainly saw that the Class eight unit sales well they're below last year, but they clearly improved in the last few months. So we do see some higher asset utilization improved spot prices and increasing capital investments. So Transportation does look like, it's in quite a bit better place at a macro level than it was a few months ago. I'll pause there, and see if I answered your question.\nAnn Duignan: Yeah. No, that's helpful. It's always good to get your perspective from what you're seeing kind of feet on the street. And then again, on Transportation more on the margin side, you had talked about last quarter, the lower margins and you gave us a contribution. I think it was 3% macro, 3% Kuebix and 3% subscription conversion and then the rest to get back to the 20% was going to be kind of self-help. Could you provide us any kind of qualitative \u2013 just where you think you are today in terms of how much of the margin was macro? How much was Kuebix? How much was subscription conversion? And then also how much of the margin decline was actually the restructuring and the inventory write-off?\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Ann, it's David Barnes. I'd say, the factors that we talked about last quarter are similar. The new one is that, we updated our plan going forward on the mobility side of the business. And running through those numbers, we did take an inventory charge, which essentially explains all of the delta between the operating margin in the second quarter and the third quarter.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. But I think you said, you took some restructuring charges also. Or was the inventory write-down the restructuring?\nDavid Barnes: No, we did a workforce reduction. But Ann that shows up in the non-GAAP restructuring charges.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Ann.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nColin Rusch: Thanks so much. As you have worked through this restructuring on the T&L business and you're looking at some of the changes in the ELD offering, can you talk about kind of early returns and feedback from customers in terms of engagement and in terms of the receptivity? And how do you generally think that transition is going to progress? How long should we be thinking about this working through a transition period?\nRob Painter: So, Colin, I'll start with the setup at the financial level and then pivot to the strategic level. At the financial level, I'll anchor that really a similar narrative from the last quarter is that we expect to see more of the flow-through improvement to the bottom line in the second half of next year than in the first half of 2021. So we're taking the moves now to position the business for long-term success long-term progression. At the \u2013 that's the financial answer. At the strategy level, the strategy we're pursuing in Transportation is that of a connected supply chain. That means connecting carriers and connecting shippers. So that isn't changing. In fact, it's progressing I think in a positive way. And on the carrier side that means connecting the driver, the truck, the fleet. And we believe that the three legs of the technology stack are telematics, which we call mobility; the back office which we refer to as our enterprise, business; and then our mapping business for the routing mapping navigation engine. And so we believe at the intersection of those three aspects that we can do something unique as Trimble in terms of connecting carriers. And then -- or in addition and in parallel is connecting the carriers to the shippers and that's why we got into the Kuebix business at the beginning of the year. And if I were to use a customer example we do feel like we're seeing some customers who want to work with us because we can be that one-stop shop because we can bring all these pieces together of the tech stack. \nColin Rusch: That's super helpful. And just adjacent to that the GM Super Cruise hands-free driving is actually getting pretty good reviews at this point. Can you give us a bit more color on that relationship how deep that is and if some of those reviews are helping open doors for you guys in the automotive market as folks look to push into Level four and Level five ADAS solutions? \nRob Painter: Well yes I'd start by saying kudos to GM. They've been very good to work with. They've been supportive. And clearly the success they've had in their program has been a catalyst to open doors for us with other automotive OEMs with Tier one suppliers and has also been relevant to opening doors with across the heavy equipment OEMs and markets like construction and agriculture. And sort of the connection point with one of the acquisitions we announced in the third quarter with our positioning services business that was the acquisition that expanded our footprint in North America to now be over size to over one million square miles. And that really is for that to provide that ubiquitous high accuracy high quick convergence time accuracy to the customers. \nColin Rusch:\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is now open. \nChad Dillard: So can you just provide a framework for how to think about the bundling opportunities in Building and Infrastructure? How much is bundled today versus where it could go over the next like one to three years? And what do you need to do in terms of distribution strategy to achieve this goal? \nRob Painter: So I'll start with the -- well there's -- I'd say there's a it happens at the intersection of the product strategy and the go-to-market strategy. So at a product level this is about understanding our market segments understanding our customers understanding that buying persona the user persona. And so when we talk about our Connect & Scale strategy it's very much a customer success strategy customer life cycle customer success strategy. So it's very much driven by that customer persona to understand what the logical bundle of technology is. What we continue to I'll say work on is making that bundle easier to consume. So think of a good better best type framework. Just make it simpler is really a point of emphasis we have on the product side because we clearly do a lot of things. And that can manifest as complexity. I actually think elegance happens through simplicity of that product offering. At the go-to-market level this is -- again if -- you start with the customer segmentation. And so depending on the size of the customer let's take a mid to larger-sized customer opportunity that looks like having one single point of contact for the customers and then having the specialists that are under the wings of that person who owns the account. So we'll have both strategy. We'll have both the reps and partners selling the individual point solutions and then at a key account or strategic account level doing business in a different way. So there's not a one size fits all. So we I'll say position ourselves or manipulate ourselves to meet the opportunity and really meet the customer where they are. \nChad Dillard: Got it. That's helpful. And then just one thing that definitely stood out to me was just the margins to the positive side for the third quarter. And as we're trying to think through the puts and takes as we go into next year and I recognize you're probably not prepared to give guidance right now, but can you give a framework for thinking about how to think about some of the temporary costs that are coming back next year? And then just from like a margin perspective, do you see like what's in your backlog a mix supportive of similar margin levels that you received this past quarter?\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Chad, it's David. I'll start by saying as you predicted, we're not yet in a position to really give a lot of clear thinking on next year. There's so much uncertainty, but if we start with the framework that the economy is going to grow back and I've seen a lot of projections that say go back in 2021 to where it will be in 2019 whether that's the U.S. or the world. And so we ought to -- hope to at least follow if not beat the overall economic trends. From a margin perspective, the megatrend driving our gross margins better principally is a revenue mix story and that looks to continue. So that will -- ought to support continued improvement at the gross margin level. We will see operating costs grow faster than revenue next year. Some of the cost reductions that we've had this year as I mentioned in my prepared remarks are not sustainable. We want to be meeting with our customers and some things that are just logistically hard to do. So how do those net out? We'll go into the year planning to try to hold margins at the operating line to close to where they are now with the gross margins going up giving us some cover for the operating expense going up a little bit. But that's just an early framework.\nChad Dillard : That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJason Celino: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. One for Rob and this builds on maybe the last question. But you talked about some of the go-to-market changes with your Connect & Scale 2025 initiatives. You talked about one single point of contact for your larger customers and maybe a rep and partner model for your smaller customers. Where does this kind of sit today? And I guess how much more work would you need to do to maybe get to this level?\nRob Painter: Hi, Jason. I mean, I'd have to say that we're in the first or second inning of the nine-inning game. We're definitely early in this journey. And I view that as a good thing, because we're able to get a lot of learnings. Some of the success that we've had thus far, I really see as more of a customer pull than a Trimble push to the customer. So it's really, I'd say, early validation that we're doing the right things when we're just listening to our customers and responding to what they're asking us to do. We have -- we named -- it's been about a year ago we named a Chief Data Officer. And one of the things that I find to be an exciting opportunity is how we can leverage the data at Trimble. Think artificial intelligence, but I mean you could just think of some basic analytics frankly to be able to compare the customers -- the customer sets we have across the different, I'll say, businesses or products and draw the overlapping circles to identify who's already using multiple Trimble solutions and to get a better sense of the bundles that could be logical for customers of a certain type. So just by mining our own data, we think there's a heck of an opportunity to point us that way and I would call that the marketing side of the go-to-market is to mine our own data and point us the way -- use that to point the teams that we talked about in the right direction. Overall, as a reporting segment, we're over on a TTM basis $1.2 billion of revenue in this business. It's a majority software business and we're operating at a scope and scale across serving a variety of stakeholders on a global basis. And we think there's -- I just want to emphasize, I think, there's a really great opportunity within the existing base that we have today not to mention then a strong value proposition to those that we don't serve today.\nJason Celino: Okay, great. And then, next question. It looks like Europe saw some nice improvement in the quarter. But maybe with some regions, maybe going back in the lockdown, can you maybe speak to any more recent trends? Maybe, any positive engagement? And then, do you feel these businesses are better prepared at this time, since we just went through it maybe six months ago?\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Jason, it's David. I'll tell you that what our teams are seeing is while you do see \u2013 you do see lockdowns in many countries around Europe they feel different from the first time around. And most of them are accommodating to project work, like what our customers do, that were for a while, sort of, out of operation in the spring. So you never say never, that it might tighten down. But surprisingly, our distributors and our end customers have been remarkably able to do their work even in this second wave.\nJason Celino: Great. No. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJerry Revich: Hi. Good afternoon and good evening, everyone.\nRob Painter: Hi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could talk about the e-Builder and Viewpoint organic growth performance just, so we can see how the businesses performed through the downturn here. And if you could talk about bookings growth and the pipeline. I think, I heard you say Rob, Viewpoint growth reaccelerated. Can you just expand on those points?\nRob Painter: Yes. To give you a couple of data points Jerry, if we look at Viewpoint and e-Builder in combination in the quarter, ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter. So, clearly, a nice progression. The net retention in both businesses was over 110%. So, clearly, good results from the businesses there. That's probably the most definitive news I could give you, good news, on the financials, so top line financials of the business. On the bookings side, Q3 was a solid bookings quarter for the construction software businesses. I'll take it -- up-level it in aggregate. It clearly was in the Viewpoint as well. So the recurring ACV is strong double-digits increase. Now some of that, of course, is Q2 business that didn't happen and moving into Q3. So I also want to be careful not to overstate that. But really just nice execution from the teams in those businesses.\nJerry Revich: And nice to hear about SketchUp, posting its second consecutive year of over 50% user growth. One of the big initiatives that you folks have cited over the past call it a year or so, is accelerating the push for the organization towards subscription. Can you talk about how much of the OpEx discussion, David, you spoke about earlier is around your efforts to maybe accelerate that shift into 2021? I bet the numbers that you're seeing from SketchUp and elsewhere in the subscription side are pushing the time line earlier than I think what we probably thought of at the Analyst Day, but maybe you can comment on those items if you don't mind. \nRob Painter: Well, there is an aspect that pushes earlier than what we talked about at Analyst Day. Clearly, the composition of revenue is ahead of where we talked about at the Analyst Day. And we've had a pandemic that certainly influenced the composition of that as we've seen the recurring revenue perform through. So I would say the context of the moment validates to us that we're heading in the right direction. The secular really I think given a -- creates a tailwind for us. When we talk about Connect & Scale, I've talked more about the Connect side in these calls. On the Scale side, it's important that we look at the systems and the processes that we have across the business. We named a Chief Digital Officer in the third quarter. I'm really happy to have this in place and I think it's going to provide us great leadership across the organization on this journey. We are investing. So when we look at the CapEx spend and you can see that flow through on the free cash flow, clearly, we will put CapEx behind this, because we do need the underlying architecture to enable additional conversions in the business to happen. We need the underlying architecture to enable the -- I'll call it to enable the bundles to transact at a scalable level. So there might -- I think it won't -- while these things I think will happen faster than we talked about at Analyst Day, I also would want to have a little bit of caution in terms of where the slope goes because we need to continue to create the enabling architecture to scale this opportunity.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Jerry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nRob Wertheimer: Hi, everybody. I had a couple of kind of strategic questions, if I may. On the construction side on automation, would you say that you're finding yourself a little bit more in competition with your OEM partner customers or finding yourself as a more valuable partner or maybe some of each as you broaden out your potential reach? That's really my first question, just how that dynamic is shaping up as different people make different investments and facets of automation?\nRob Painter: Hi, Rob. I think it's a little bit of both is the honest answer. And I think you could -- the easiest segmentation happens at the size of the organization. If you're a Tier 2- 3-sized OEM it clearly -- we believe it would clearly make more sense to work with a scaled technology provider then to try and create those investments in-house. And we start always by talking about the mixed fleet. So mixed fleet is so fundamentally important. So an autonomous site isn't going to work if you have proprietary -- multitudes of proprietary equipment running around on a site together not communicating with one another. In fact, when we look at the strategy we have in autonomy, yes, we have positioning technologies and a strategy that's very relevant to the autonomous -- an automated movement of equipment. But that has very little value without a deep understanding of the work that has to be carried out. So we think that by understanding the physical world in which these machine operates that we have the ability to develop the optimal plans for the tasks at hand and to really be that brain for the site or the farm. And we think that that's a really important aspect of the Trimble strategy. So to be that operational center for the mixed fleet is an important aspect of the strategy. And then -- and then when we get into the tech stack, what we've talked about for years is machine control and guidance that we do in civil construction what we call steering and guidance in agriculture. We call it automation. Well that's autonomy. It's sort of between Level 1 and Level 2 autonomy. And we keep working up that automation spectrum towards Level 3. We look at specific workflows that will make sense, machine types and workflows that would lend themselves to an autonomous work situation that will make sense. And then we think we've got a full spectrum of cloud perception, optimization and control technologies that are relevant here.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you. Fascinating area. The other question I'm sorry for the clarification, but for the decision you made in transport that -- the decisions and inventory write-down to the extent you're able, can you just clarify you exiting product lines anyway? Are you exiting just a product and replacing it? And then just how do you feel about customer traction there and ability to sort of ramp back up with truck production? Thanks. I\u2019ll stop.\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Rob, it's David Barnes. So as you look at the revenue line you can see that the volume of business we're serving is going down. So the restructuring in part simply recognizes that the business has contracted and smaller than it was. A lot of the strategy we're working through to improve customer retention and customer satisfaction is about streamlining the product offering, replacing old technology with more supportable technologies going forward. So when you support fewer platforms, you need less resource over time. The inventory write-down specifically was about products that were committed to when the business was bigger and more healthy and we've worked through our strategy with regard to customer targeting and pricing. And we've recognized that the inventory valuation -- we've updated it to reflect that plan. So we're not \u2013 we haven't exited any businesses per se. We're optimizing the business that we've got and as Rob said, aiming for the inflection point where on all the key metrics of ARR and revenue growth and margins we can get momentum toward what a good business looks like in Trimble in the second half of next year.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. So for clarity you're not like exiting a kind of business you're just I don't know if 80-20 is the right way to state it for you guys, but trying to serve the customers with a less diverse product set or such and that's what led to the right time.\nDavid Barnes: No that's right. No we haven't exited any business. We're still serving the customers' needs just doing it more efficiently with products that are fit for the future.\nRob Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Blake Gendron from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nBlake Gendron: Yes. Hi, thanks. Thanks for squeezing on here. So I wanted to follow up on subscription transition talk and just get a better idea for on a relative basis where B&I is in that transition relative to the software aspects of your other segments. And then digging into B&I, specifically I was wondering if you have noticed any interplay between the subscription transition and maybe the size of the customers that are signing on, presumably get the large customers to sign on first that drives some of the subscription transition and then by network effect some of the smaller stakeholders start to sign on as well and maybe that accelerates the transition further. Are you noticing any sort of interplay there? \nRob Painter: So I'll start with B&I and where we think we are on the software transition. I would describe that more in middle innings maybe early middle innings on the software transition. In Transportation, I would say we're in the probably solid middle innings on that business maybe in the late middle innings on that one. Our enterprise business which is the back-office software, we are executing a transition to a subscription model in that business. The rest of the businesses really already are subscription and Transportation. So that's a little further ahead mathematically than B&I would be. I'd say Geospatial is a very small aspect of it. So it might be early but it's a lower dollar amount. And then the Resources and Utilities reasonably far along. And one of the strategies we have Blake is also looking at hardware businesses and rethinking the business models on some of those. So while you're asking about software I just also want to comment that I think if we take the civil construction business we launched what we call Trimble Platform-as-a-Service in the quarter and that's a new way to monetize the business, where think of it as a bundle of the machine control hardware with the software with ongoing support and service providing technology assurance for the customer. So we can upgrade functionality over the lifetime of that. So we're really taking a fresh look at all the business models we have. And then when you ask about the interplay with subscriptions and customer sizes, the one that we talk about the most is actually at the owner level. And our belief set is that if we can \u2013 when the owners and I'll say, some of it's hearts and minds and some of it is the owner business that we have whether that's a Department of Transportation or the owners that \u2013 the capital programs that we manage through our e-Builder business, where we manage hundreds of billions of dollars of committed construction volume, we see that as a mechanism or a catalyst to promote the use of technology into the field. And then at some level I guess you could say once you've done that you could look at the general contractors as the catalyst win the GC, win the subcontractor and think about the waterfall as such.\nBlake Gendron: Really appreciate the answer there. And one follow-up if I could just on M&A. Any portfolio gaps in B&I that exist, particularly in light of the WorksOS launch, which seems pretty compelling? And then could you maybe contextualize the divestiture of the construction Logistics business in light of WorksOS? Is it that you're trying to focus more on the owner or contract or subcontractor and maybe away from the smaller inputs in the stakeholder chain? Or what was sort of the strategic driver behind that? \nRob Painter: I'll start with the divestiture of the construction logistics business. It's a business we've had for a long time. It was arguably our first foray into telematics many years ago. From -- I'll say from a financial standpoint or maybe even a governance standpoint, I think as management we're paid to allocate capital efficiently. And when we look at how to allocate capital in the construction logistics business, it was a business that's reasonably concentrated and penetrated.  And we felt that when we look at the landscape of it that it was -- its future was best served to be part of Command Alkon was the buyer. It's the future of the business and therefore I think the future of the individuals who work in the business. And we wish that business great success. It's better served combined with Command Alkon.  So I think, we at a strategic level to allocate capital optimally either needed to be a buyer or a seller. And the nature of the market was such that we thought it was better to be a seller on the construction logistics business. It doesn't change the conviction of our view on the connected strategy nor as a signal of a shift of any intent whatsoever.  And then you asked on the acquisition side, I would -- rather than maybe be specific about where we might see gaps, I would say we think about making acquisitions that advance our Connect & Scale strategic imperative. So on the connect side, we certainly look across that life cycle and across the stakeholders and we'll think about where we have additional opportunities to serve.  In many cases that may be tuck-in and there's businesses out there. There's a long tail of activity in construction tech that -- I'll say construction tech businesses which arguably are -- their long-term futures to be a feature inside of a larger company such as Trimble. So there could be some aspects of that that really help us tighten the workflow or bring additional data elements that are -- that we think could be compelling. So that's how we think about the acquisition side. \nBlake Gendron: Understood. Really appreciate the comment. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thanks. I just want to follow up quickly on the M&A commentary Rob as well as just the product portfolio. Where are we from divestitures and examination of the portfolio standpoint? Is there more to be done there? How do you feel like you're looking now? And as far as the acquisitions et cetera -- the acquisitions that you are doing, you would think about doing is there -- are they largely in kind of the business and pricing model that you want to get to already? Or is there going to be some transition period do you think for a lot of them as you pull them into the business? \nRob Painter: Let me start on the divestiture question and I'll probably have to ask you to repeat the acquisition one. I didn't quite make all of that out. On the divestiture side, we continue to look at the portfolio. And so if the axes -- if the two axes are strategic fit and financial performance we have a point of view of our own portfolio. The time has to be right for us and I'd say a potential buyer. I don't want to signal that there's, major trunks or branches of the Trimble business that wouldn't be there. I just think we're doing the right -- we'll go back to my comment about -- I think we're paid to allocate capital efficiently and effectively. And we're looking at the -- in the context of the opportunities that we see in front of us, in construction and agriculture, transportation, and our core survey business, where do we have opportunities to continue to win, to gain a relative market share, and to effectively execute the strategy. And where -- if we feel, in any of those that we're in a suboptimal position okay well that would certainly say something about strategic fit. I just want to say, we are being diligent in the exercise. It's an ongoing effort. And I think it's something that we should always be on an ongoing basis, be looking at. So that's a divestiture answer, but I missed the acquisition question.\nJames Faucette: Sorry, I wasn't clear there. I was just asking, if the acquisitions that you are doing or looking at, are those businesses already kind of in subscription model structure, in terms of go-to-market. Or are there likely to be transition periods to move them over to that et cetera, especially where it makes sense?\nRob Painter: Okay. Got it. That's fair. Good question. I'd say that could look like two flavors. One would be I would call it, a software-centric acquisition. And the second would be really more, autonomy related. And the more autonomy ones, from an accounting perspective, are likely to show up in hardware. Now how they monetize over time okay, that we'll say remains to be seen. So those would be the two vectors that we think about James. And on -- for the software ones, we don't have a dogma that says it has to be a subscription business already, all things equal, that's a good thing. All things equal, if it's already in a transition, that's better than not being in one at all. But we don't make that a, hard cutoff criteria for acquisition screening.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thanks a lot.\nRob Painter: Thanks, James.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to our presenters, for any closing remarks.\nMichael Leyba: Thank you very much everyone for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you so much for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Hello, everyone and thanks for taking the time to be with us today. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. We'll start on slide 2 with the four key messages we want to convey today. First, the resilience of our team, the quality of our strategy and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the third quarter. ARR grew 10% year-over-year to $1.26 billion, while quarterly revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $793 million. Expanding gross margins and execution on costs led to adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.8%. Our shift to a more hardware connected, software centric and recurring revenue business model is working. I want to express my gratitude to the Trimble team, who continues to perform strongly under these challenging conditions, as well as our customers and investors for your continued support and confidence in Trimble. Second, executing on the Connect & Scale 2025 strategy remains our focus. We are working to connect stakeholders and industry lifecycle data to improve and transform customer workflows. The business model transitions are an output of this strategy, not an input. Third, we continue to put organizational elements in place to enable the strategy. Most recently we have named James Dalton, as our newest Board member; and we promoted from within to hire a Chief People Officer, a Chief Digital Officer, a VP of Talent & Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and a Head of Sustainability. Fourth, our long-term conviction remains strong. We will balance cost containment and investment in innovation during the downturn. On one hand, we've reduced our cost base in transportation in the quarter. On the other hand, we continue to increase our investments in autonomy and digital transformation. We maintain our goal to exit this recession on a stronger competitive footing than we entered it; and on that note, we are in a more proactive mode of looking for acquisition opportunities, which will advance our Connect & Scale strategy. At the reporting segment level, a few strategic comments to make. In Buildings & Infrastructure, we saw better-than-expected results in civil construction machine control and guidance. In addition, our software businesses delivered a strong level of recurring revenue growth. In Geospatial, innovation is sparking demand. Our end customers have been getting back to work and catching up on project activity. In Resources & Utilities, the agriculture market has been resilient. In North America, for example, commodity prices have risen, while direct support payments to farmers remain well above historical averages. Markets such as Australia, Japan and Brazil all performed well in the quarter. These overall favorable conditions combined with the compelling ROI on investing in precision agriculture have contributed to our growth in 2020. In Transportation, we took several meaningful steps, which we believe will position the business for better performance in the quarters and years ahead. We implemented a substantial restructuring in the business during the third quarter, which will lower our ongoing fixed operating costs. Further, we made business plan decisions which resulted in an inventory charge in the third quarter. With these difficult decisions behind us, we can now see the path for improved performance in 2021 as compared to the second half of 2020. At the macro level, market conditions have begun to improve in the transportation market with higher asset utilization, improved spot prices and increasing capital investment. Overall, we are cautiously optimistic that market conditions will support sustained growth for Trimble through 2021. As we move from election mode to governing mode we will follow decisions on stimulus measures, especially, infrastructure and local government funding and policy decisions relating to trade and tax. Let me now turn the call over to David for a review of the numbers. Let me close by turning to slide 9 and reinforcing how we progressed against our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy in the quarter. First, connecting solutions across our industry lifecycles. Two examples to share. In Construction, we released WorksOS, which integrates design data from the office with machine control data to deliver real-time progress and productivity updates for the entire jobsite. Slide 10 shows a visual of how Trimble is transforming workflows in construction by connecting the physical and digital worlds. This is how we bring together the office and the field with our hardware and software, in a unique Trimble way. Today, we put a constructible digital engineering model on the blade of construction equipment. With WorksOS, we can dynamically bring back surface data and view progress to plan. In essence, this workflow positions us to take the 3D constructible model and next add dimensions of cost and schedule to create a 5D model. From here we will integrate this enriched model into the construction ERP system with additional, financial and asset management views. The aggregation of all this data, coupled with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is a further step towards an autonomous future. Back to slide 9 and another example from construction, we launched augmented reality into our Trimble earthworks machine control and guidance solution. Augmented reality is available in the cab of the excavator, which helps operators more easily understand 3D models, cut/fill information, slope data and other reference points. Second; delivering breakout innovation. Two examples to share. In Geospatial, our new GNSS receiver, the R12i, has been a market success. The innovation in the GNSS receiver is the integration of inertial technology that enables robust tilt compensation. What this means is that the surveyor can work productively and effectively in challenging environments. We are making our customers' work easier. The second example is highlighted on slide 11. Our structural BIM software is used for many types of materials and projects. This past month, the team announced the winners of our 2020 BIM awards. On this slide you will see the winners for best infrastructure and best commercial projects. A closer look reveals that these projects deliver more than just incredibly detailed design visualization. What these engineering teams are delivering are the precise specifications needed to automate fabrication for each individual component, as well as instructions for assembling those complex designs in the field. This is what we call \u201cConstructible Design\u201d and these two projects are exemplary. Third; accelerating our business model transformation. In Construction, we sold our first Platform-as-a-Service offering in our civil construction business. We are delivering technology assurance for our customers while integrating construction cloud services and world-class support to keep our customers' operations current and optimized. Fourth; we are taking actions that enable us to efficiently and effectively scale our business. Last week we closed on the divestiture of our construction logistics business; and in the third quarter we completed the acquisition of a business that further expands our positioning services network to now cover over one million square miles in North America. We are making decisions and investments in the area of cloud enablement, data management, and artificial intelligence that are connected in approach, which will enable us to scale to meet the opportunity ahead of us. With that, I'd like to thank everyone for taking the time to be with us today, and a special thank you to our global Trimble colleagues. Operator, let's please go to Q&A. Hi, Gal, welcome back. As it relates to the ARR growth in the quarter, so 10% at a total company level around 6% at an organic level. If we exclude the Transportation business, we'd be in the double-digit growth on ARR including in the construction business, so in the Buildings and Infrastructure reporting segment. In terms of the breakdown between new customers and existing customers it's both is the short answer where we've seen growth. So we are figuring out a way to sell into new logo customers in this digital environment. So we take a business such as the SketchUp business ARR grew almost actually 50% -- more than 50% year-over-year. And that's clearly coming from an expansion of the addressable market and winning new logos seeing the same thing in the Viewpoint business. Having said that like compared to let's say a prepandemic level it is there is a greater weight towards penetration of existing customers at the total portfolio level and I think it's probably for the obvious reasons. Does that help? So if I say -- I'll use construction as the example. And you're right. I mean the connect part of the Connect & Scale strategy is absolutely to connect stakeholders data solutions across the industry life cycle, whether it's construction agriculture transportation utilities forestry. To give you an example in construction, we can see -- for example if I just take the Viewpoint business discretely which is the construction management system that system of record for the construction company we've had over $1.5 million of new ACV in the last 12 months. And this is really a customer pull. We're really early I would say in the Trimble push of the strategy. So customer pool essentially to create suites or bundles of solutions to connect into that system of record. So for example -- and construction telematics, the information on asset utilization that can augment job cost which is in the ERP. If we look at our structural business, fabrication management that ties into the material estimates which are in the back office software. If we look at the MEP or mechanical electrical plumbing business, we have there we see the integration of estimating, pricing, change, management job cost and procurement into that system of record. So we're seeing real examples where our customers are asking us to integrate the various Trimble technologies that they have. And we're starting to see a few more new logo wins as a result of being able to come in as a unified face to that customer. In terms of who we sell to in that new model a recent example with an ENR 400 customer who made a significant commitment to Trimble. I was with the CIO. So it starts to look more like C-level when we're up-leveling the sale to an overall Trimble sale. Clearly that correlates to the contract sizes. So let's say as opposed to three, 3 four separate contracts which could be in the tens or low hundreds of thousands each right it starts to become over on a total contract value basis they start to look more like $1 million type deals as where we're heading with it. Rick so I think it's pretty similar narrative to what we had last quarter. I'll start by saying we did meet the topline expectations we have so it's clearly below our long-term ambition. But just to establish I'd say credibility that we can hit the number that we put forward as a starting point there at the topline. What's similar to the narrative from last quarter that holds is we expect that the moves that we're making now we'll see the fruit of that in margin expansion into I'll say the second half of next year. We'll see that more in the second half of next year than the first half. The nature of the recurring revenue business is that it does take a while for that engine to get going. And when it gets going it becomes a cumulative game from that point. So, really a similar view and -- but I think you characterized it well upfront. Sure. Hi Ann. So, I'll start with the Buildings and Infrastructure and do a little bit of a walk around the stakeholders. I think the logical place to start would be with the owners. And I'll use -- I'll start in the U.S. thinking about state DOTs or Department of Transportations as owners. And I would say the DOTs have been more resilient than we expected. And so that's been a good thing. So that would be a comment on a large owner segment. If I go next to architecture and when we look at the indicators the ABI is still below 50. Now, we saw September looks more encouraging than the numbers did in August. So, I think the ABI is helpful for macro health. But when we look at our actual architecture and design business it's meaningless because that's the business where we saw ARR up almost 50% year-over-year. If we go to civil construction and I'll stay in North America for a little bit. Civil contractors what we saw is a decrease in backlog with civil contractors, but an increase in backlog with civil engineers. And so that would suggest an initial recovery that could flow through to the contractors. If we look at our Viewpoint business where we could see the system of record for general contractors again confirm that some bookings are slowing and some of the velocity of hiring has been lower as compared to 2019. When we look outside the U.S., if we take construction PMI that shows a mixed view forward with the number of markets expecting expansion next year with I'd say an emphasis on Europe, when I quote construction PMI numbers. We also look at a basket of backlog at some of the largest construction companies in North America and Europe. And what we see there is that \u2013 and this is not surprising, we see that residential is doing well. Commercial's down. EPC and infrastructure have been down a little bit. So what we see, if I try to summarize that is, we see some of the end market work moving around. I would say, the numbers we see today are unambiguously better than what we saw in that March, April, May time frame. What's conflicting are the signals on sustained demand, and I think I would close on that, one by saying, what we do feel is that there is unequivocal demand for digitization and improved access to information. So we think at the secular level, we're in the right place. And if I go to Transportation, and I probably could start actually with some of the research you had we certainly saw that the Class eight unit sales well they're below last year, but they clearly improved in the last few months. So we do see some higher asset utilization improved spot prices and increasing capital investments. So Transportation does look like, it's in quite a bit better place at a macro level than it was a few months ago. I'll pause there, and see if I answered your question. Thanks, Ann. So, Colin, I'll start with the setup at the financial level and then pivot to the strategic level. At the financial level, I'll anchor that really a similar narrative from the last quarter is that we expect to see more of the flow-through improvement to the bottom line in the second half of next year than in the first half of 2021. So we're taking the moves now to position the business for long-term success long-term progression. At the \u2013 that's the financial answer. At the strategy level, the strategy we're pursuing in Transportation is that of a connected supply chain. That means connecting carriers and connecting shippers. So that isn't changing. In fact, it's progressing I think in a positive way. And on the carrier side that means connecting the driver, the truck, the fleet. And we believe that the three legs of the technology stack are telematics, which we call mobility; the back office which we refer to as our enterprise, business; and then our mapping business for the routing mapping navigation engine. And so we believe at the intersection of those three aspects that we can do something unique as Trimble in terms of connecting carriers. And then -- or in addition and in parallel is connecting the carriers to the shippers and that's why we got into the Kuebix business at the beginning of the year. And if I were to use a customer example we do feel like we're seeing some customers who want to work with us because we can be that one-stop shop because we can bring all these pieces together of the tech stack. Well yes I'd start by saying kudos to GM. They've been very good to work with. They've been supportive. And clearly the success they've had in their program has been a catalyst to open doors for us with other automotive OEMs with Tier one suppliers and has also been relevant to opening doors with across the heavy equipment OEMs and markets like construction and agriculture. And sort of the connection point with one of the acquisitions we announced in the third quarter with our positioning services business that was the acquisition that expanded our footprint in North America to now be over size to over one million square miles. And that really is for that to provide that ubiquitous high accuracy high quick convergence time accuracy to the customers. So I'll start with the -- well there's -- I'd say there's a it happens at the intersection of the product strategy and the go-to-market strategy. So at a product level this is about understanding our market segments understanding our customers understanding that buying persona the user persona. And so when we talk about our Connect & Scale strategy it's very much a customer success strategy customer life cycle customer success strategy. So it's very much driven by that customer persona to understand what the logical bundle of technology is. What we continue to I'll say work on is making that bundle easier to consume. So think of a good better best type framework. Just make it simpler is really a point of emphasis we have on the product side because we clearly do a lot of things. And that can manifest as complexity. I actually think elegance happens through simplicity of that product offering. At the go-to-market level this is -- again if -- you start with the customer segmentation. And so depending on the size of the customer let's take a mid to larger-sized customer opportunity that looks like having one single point of contact for the customers and then having the specialists that are under the wings of that person who owns the account. So we'll have both strategy. We'll have both the reps and partners selling the individual point solutions and then at a key account or strategic account level doing business in a different way. So there's not a one size fits all. So we I'll say position ourselves or manipulate ourselves to meet the opportunity and really meet the customer where they are. Hi, Jason. I mean, I'd have to say that we're in the first or second inning of the nine-inning game. We're definitely early in this journey. And I view that as a good thing, because we're able to get a lot of learnings. Some of the success that we've had thus far, I really see as more of a customer pull than a Trimble push to the customer. So it's really, I'd say, early validation that we're doing the right things when we're just listening to our customers and responding to what they're asking us to do. We have -- we named -- it's been about a year ago we named a Chief Data Officer. And one of the things that I find to be an exciting opportunity is how we can leverage the data at Trimble. Think artificial intelligence, but I mean you could just think of some basic analytics frankly to be able to compare the customers -- the customer sets we have across the different, I'll say, businesses or products and draw the overlapping circles to identify who's already using multiple Trimble solutions and to get a better sense of the bundles that could be logical for customers of a certain type. So just by mining our own data, we think there's a heck of an opportunity to point us that way and I would call that the marketing side of the go-to-market is to mine our own data and point us the way -- use that to point the teams that we talked about in the right direction. Overall, as a reporting segment, we're over on a TTM basis $1.2 billion of revenue in this business. It's a majority software business and we're operating at a scope and scale across serving a variety of stakeholders on a global basis. And we think there's -- I just want to emphasize, I think, there's a really great opportunity within the existing base that we have today not to mention then a strong value proposition to those that we don't serve today. Hi, Jerry. Yes. To give you a couple of data points Jerry, if we look at Viewpoint and e-Builder in combination in the quarter, ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter. So, clearly, a nice progression. The net retention in both businesses was over 110%. So, clearly, good results from the businesses there. That's probably the most definitive news I could give you, good news, on the financials, so top line financials of the business. On the bookings side, Q3 was a solid bookings quarter for the construction software businesses. I'll take it -- up-level it in aggregate. It clearly was in the Viewpoint as well. So the recurring ACV is strong double-digits increase. Now some of that, of course, is Q2 business that didn't happen and moving into Q3. So I also want to be careful not to overstate that. But really just nice execution from the teams in those businesses. Well, there is an aspect that pushes earlier than what we talked about at Analyst Day. Clearly, the composition of revenue is ahead of where we talked about at the Analyst Day. And we've had a pandemic that certainly influenced the composition of that as we've seen the recurring revenue perform through. So I would say the context of the moment validates to us that we're heading in the right direction. The secular really I think given a -- creates a tailwind for us. When we talk about Connect & Scale, I've talked more about the Connect side in these calls. On the Scale side, it's important that we look at the systems and the processes that we have across the business. We named a Chief Digital Officer in the third quarter. I'm really happy to have this in place and I think it's going to provide us great leadership across the organization on this journey. We are investing. So when we look at the CapEx spend and you can see that flow through on the free cash flow, clearly, we will put CapEx behind this, because we do need the underlying architecture to enable additional conversions in the business to happen. We need the underlying architecture to enable the -- I'll call it to enable the bundles to transact at a scalable level. So there might -- I think it won't -- while these things I think will happen faster than we talked about at Analyst Day, I also would want to have a little bit of caution in terms of where the slope goes because we need to continue to create the enabling architecture to scale this opportunity. Thanks, Jerry. Hi, Rob. I think it's a little bit of both is the honest answer. And I think you could -- the easiest segmentation happens at the size of the organization. If you're a Tier 2- 3-sized OEM it clearly -- we believe it would clearly make more sense to work with a scaled technology provider then to try and create those investments in-house. And we start always by talking about the mixed fleet. So mixed fleet is so fundamentally important. So an autonomous site isn't going to work if you have proprietary -- multitudes of proprietary equipment running around on a site together not communicating with one another. In fact, when we look at the strategy we have in autonomy, yes, we have positioning technologies and a strategy that's very relevant to the autonomous -- an automated movement of equipment. But that has very little value without a deep understanding of the work that has to be carried out. So we think that by understanding the physical world in which these machine operates that we have the ability to develop the optimal plans for the tasks at hand and to really be that brain for the site or the farm. And we think that that's a really important aspect of the Trimble strategy. So to be that operational center for the mixed fleet is an important aspect of the strategy. And then -- and then when we get into the tech stack, what we've talked about for years is machine control and guidance that we do in civil construction what we call steering and guidance in agriculture. We call it automation. Well that's autonomy. It's sort of between Level 1 and Level 2 autonomy. And we keep working up that automation spectrum towards Level 3. We look at specific workflows that will make sense, machine types and workflows that would lend themselves to an autonomous work situation that will make sense. And then we think we've got a full spectrum of cloud perception, optimization and control technologies that are relevant here. So I'll start with B&I and where we think we are on the software transition. I would describe that more in middle innings maybe early middle innings on the software transition. In Transportation, I would say we're in the probably solid middle innings on that business maybe in the late middle innings on that one. Our enterprise business which is the back-office software, we are executing a transition to a subscription model in that business. The rest of the businesses really already are subscription and Transportation. So that's a little further ahead mathematically than B&I would be. I'd say Geospatial is a very small aspect of it. So it might be early but it's a lower dollar amount. And then the Resources and Utilities reasonably far along. And one of the strategies we have Blake is also looking at hardware businesses and rethinking the business models on some of those. So while you're asking about software I just also want to comment that I think if we take the civil construction business we launched what we call Trimble Platform-as-a-Service in the quarter and that's a new way to monetize the business, where think of it as a bundle of the machine control hardware with the software with ongoing support and service providing technology assurance for the customer. So we can upgrade functionality over the lifetime of that. So we're really taking a fresh look at all the business models we have. And then when you ask about the interplay with subscriptions and customer sizes, the one that we talk about the most is actually at the owner level. And our belief set is that if we can \u2013 when the owners and I'll say, some of it's hearts and minds and some of it is the owner business that we have whether that's a Department of Transportation or the owners that \u2013 the capital programs that we manage through our e-Builder business, where we manage hundreds of billions of dollars of committed construction volume, we see that as a mechanism or a catalyst to promote the use of technology into the field. And then at some level I guess you could say once you've done that you could look at the general contractors as the catalyst win the GC, win the subcontractor and think about the waterfall as such. I'll start with the divestiture of the construction logistics business. It's a business we've had for a long time. It was arguably our first foray into telematics many years ago. From -- I'll say from a financial standpoint or maybe even a governance standpoint, I think as management we're paid to allocate capital efficiently. And when we look at how to allocate capital in the construction logistics business, it was a business that's reasonably concentrated and penetrated.  And we felt that when we look at the landscape of it that it was -- its future was best served to be part of Command Alkon was the buyer. It's the future of the business and therefore I think the future of the individuals who work in the business. And we wish that business great success. It's better served combined with Command Alkon.  So I think, we at a strategic level to allocate capital optimally either needed to be a buyer or a seller. And the nature of the market was such that we thought it was better to be a seller on the construction logistics business. It doesn't change the conviction of our view on the connected strategy nor as a signal of a shift of any intent whatsoever.  And then you asked on the acquisition side, I would -- rather than maybe be specific about where we might see gaps, I would say we think about making acquisitions that advance our Connect & Scale strategic imperative. So on the connect side, we certainly look across that life cycle and across the stakeholders and we'll think about where we have additional opportunities to serve.  In many cases that may be tuck-in and there's businesses out there. There's a long tail of activity in construction tech that -- I'll say construction tech businesses which arguably are -- their long-term futures to be a feature inside of a larger company such as Trimble. So there could be some aspects of that that really help us tighten the workflow or bring additional data elements that are -- that we think could be compelling. So that's how we think about the acquisition side. Let me start on the divestiture question and I'll probably have to ask you to repeat the acquisition one. I didn't quite make all of that out. On the divestiture side, we continue to look at the portfolio. And so if the axes -- if the two axes are strategic fit and financial performance we have a point of view of our own portfolio. The time has to be right for us and I'd say a potential buyer. I don't want to signal that there's, major trunks or branches of the Trimble business that wouldn't be there. I just think we're doing the right -- we'll go back to my comment about -- I think we're paid to allocate capital efficiently and effectively. And we're looking at the -- in the context of the opportunities that we see in front of us, in construction and agriculture, transportation, and our core survey business, where do we have opportunities to continue to win, to gain a relative market share, and to effectively execute the strategy. And where -- if we feel, in any of those that we're in a suboptimal position okay well that would certainly say something about strategic fit. I just want to say, we are being diligent in the exercise. It's an ongoing effort. And I think it's something that we should always be on an ongoing basis, be looking at. So that's a divestiture answer, but I missed the acquisition question. Okay. Got it. That's fair. Good question. I'd say that could look like two flavors. One would be I would call it, a software-centric acquisition. And the second would be really more, autonomy related. And the more autonomy ones, from an accounting perspective, are likely to show up in hardware. Now how they monetize over time okay, that we'll say remains to be seen. So those would be the two vectors that we think about James. And on -- for the software ones, we don't have a dogma that says it has to be a subscription business already, all things equal, that's a good thing. All things equal, if it's already in a transition, that's better than not being in one at all. But we don't make that a, hard cutoff criteria for acquisition screening. Thanks, James."

            "name": "David Barnes",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Let's begin on slide 3 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $793 million, up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Net of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange fluctuations organic revenue declined 1%. Gross margin in the third quarter was 58.8% up 180 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by improved revenue mix and also assisted by lower discounting and new products with higher margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, up 380 basis points year-over-year, a result of both gross margin expansion and cost reduction. Cost reduction was driven by structural actions and temporary factors related to COVID-19. Operating income margins also expanded 360 basis points to 24.2%. Net income dollars increased by 26% on a year-over-year basis, while earnings per share increased by $0.12 to $0.60 per share. Turning to slide 4. Our third quarter cash flow from operations was $181 million, reflecting the strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow represented approximately 1.2 times non-GAAP net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $165 million. We paid down over $150 million of net debt in the quarter and the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1.9 times. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $184 million in cash. In addition, we have no scheduled principal payments on our debt, until July 2022. Our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. Next on slide 5, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Annualized recurring revenue, which as a reminder includes the annualized value of term licenses was $1.26 billion in the third quarter, up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Organic growth of ARR was 6%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble organic ARR grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter. Net working capital inclusive of deferred revenue represents approximately 1% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis demonstrating the asset-light nature of our business model. We continue to proactively manage our costs, while maintaining investment in key initiatives. Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was nearly 15% of revenue. Two additional metrics that we follow are deferred revenue and backlog. Our deferred revenue was up 20% on a year-over-year basis through a combination of organic and acquisition-related growth and our backlog was $1.2 billion, up more than 10% versus prior year. These two metrics give us additional visibility into the future revenue trends in the quarters ahead. Turning to slide 6. Recurring revenues made up 37% of total Trimble revenue in the quarter compared to 35% a year ago. We experienced recurring revenue growth, across a wide range of businesses. Even in a tough economic environment, these offerings are essential to the operation of our customers' businesses. Our non-recurring revenues, including hardware perpetual software and professional services, experienced a year-over-year decline of about 2% in the quarter. Performance in these areas was helped by strength in our Geospatial and agriculture businesses, offset by expected weak performance in Transportation. Overall, our professional service trends improved somewhat in the quarter from the beginning of the COVID crisis, but are still negatively impacted by lack of access to our customers' facilities and employees. In terms of geography, North America was down 5% representing a sequential improvement when compared to the second quarter, which was down 17%. Revenues in North America were adversely impacted by the declines in our Transportation business. Excluding Transportation, revenue in North America grew over 2% year-over-year in the third quarter. Europe was up 9%, reflecting broad-based improvement in project activity across the continent. Asia Pacific was once again the best performer in the quarter up 16%. Agriculture was a bright spot in Asia Pacific in the quarter as Australia recovered from a multiyear drought and the Japanese government implemented increased direct support of farmers. Our business in China, while still small grew year-on-year in the third quarter as the country recovered from the easing of COVID-related shutdowns. Turning now to slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 1% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in our software businesses. Segment margins were up nearly four percentage points, due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 7% on an organic basis, driven principally by increased sales to OEM customers. Revenue from sales of system to the surveying and mapping sector was essentially flat versus prior year, a meaningful improvement from the second quarter when revenues were down nearly 20% year-on-year. Margins were up over 11 percentage points due to a combination of higher-margin revenue mix, compelling new products, lower levels of discounting and strong cost control. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 16% on an organic basis. We benefited from double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture, positioning services and agriculture software offerings. M&A growth also played a role in the segment growth in the quarter as the integration of Cityworks has added significant capability to our offerings for utilities and local governments. Margins expanded over 7 percentage points, driven by improved revenue mix strong profitability from M&A and cost control. While top line results in Transportation were consistent with our expectations coming into the quarter, the business performed well below our long-term objectives. Segment revenue was down 21% on an organic basis and margins declined over 10 percentage points. The drivers of revenue and margin decline are broadly consistent with those we highlighted in our last earnings call. The rate of revenue decline did improve in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter as did customer retention. Profitability in the quarter was impacted by lower revenue subscription transition and M&A as well as an inventory charge that we took in the mobility business. Turning now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We continue to face significant uncertainty in market demand across the industry sectors we serve. With the rate of COVID-19 infection increasing in many countries, our customers face renewed risks of work restrictions stemming from governmental rules to curb the spread of the virus. And the pace of the recovery in the broader economy remains uncertain. As a result, we still don't have sufficient clarity in the end-user demand to enable us to give guidance. As we did last quarter, we will provide some color on the most important trends which will drive our performance. Starting with revenue. I'll remind you that our fiscal year 2019 had an extra week. The lack of the 14th week this quarter will adversely impact overall Trimble revenue growth by approximately $23 million or about 3%. In this quarter, we will enjoy less benefit from projects deferred at the onset of the pandemic last spring. Finally, the combination of lapping our Cityworks acquisition from the fourth quarter of 2019 and the recent divestiture of Construction Logistics resulted in less favorable inorganic revenue growth momentum. Considering all of these factors, we anticipate that total Trimble revenue will be down modestly versus prior year in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless we expect that our recurring revenue businesses will remain robust with organic ARR growth in line with third quarter 2020 performance. Note again that Cityworks, which is principally a recurring term license business, was part of Trimble for much of the fourth quarter in 2019. From a segment perspective, Resources and Utilities revenue will continue to grow in the fourth quarter albeit at a more modest rate as we lap the strong fourth quarter of last year. Transportation revenues are likely to decline at a rate comparable to what we experienced in the third quarter. The Geospatial and Buildings and Infrastructure segments are likely to see revenue trends at about the company average. Turning to gross margins. We expect margins roughly flat versus prior year in the fourth quarter. The extra week in the fourth quarter of last year did boost margins and we won't have that positive impact in this quarter. Separate from this factor, though, we do expect gross margins to continue their strong performance driven by software mix, new products and reduced discounting. Our operating expenses will grow modestly in the quarter, up approximately $20 million sequentially from the third quarter. With our improved performance outlook for the year, we anticipate higher incentive compensation and we are seeing a gradual increase in discretionary spending across areas where spending was unsustainably low due to COVID restrictions. Assuming the revenue and margin dynamics I've described, we expect to manage to decremental margins in the low to mid-30s. Finally, I will note that we project continued healthy cash flow generation. With our leverage now at our long-term target we have reinstituted a modest share repurchase program. We will continue to employ a disciplined approach to capital allocation as we manage our capital structure and invest for the future. With that, I will turn it over to Rob to conclude. Hey Richard, it's David Barnes. I'll offer up a couple of observations. Part of what we did benefit from is catching up on projects that got stalled or delayed in Q2. So, that helped. But that's not all of it. As Rob mentioned we've had a lot of innovation in the Geospatial area which is improving revenue trends and margins by the way. And so -- and we're seeing some -- it's hard to draw a trend in these noisy times, but some improvement in a number of our hardware areas that you're right bring software with it. So a bit of all three. Hey, Ann, it's David Barnes. I'd say, the factors that we talked about last quarter are similar. The new one is that, we updated our plan going forward on the mobility side of the business. And running through those numbers, we did take an inventory charge, which essentially explains all of the delta between the operating margin in the second quarter and the third quarter. No, we did a workforce reduction. But Ann that shows up in the non-GAAP restructuring charges. Hey, Chad, it's David. I'll start by saying as you predicted, we're not yet in a position to really give a lot of clear thinking on next year. There's so much uncertainty, but if we start with the framework that the economy is going to grow back and I've seen a lot of projections that say go back in 2021 to where it will be in 2019 whether that's the U.S. or the world. And so we ought to -- hope to at least follow if not beat the overall economic trends. From a margin perspective, the megatrend driving our gross margins better principally is a revenue mix story and that looks to continue. So that will -- ought to support continued improvement at the gross margin level. We will see operating costs grow faster than revenue next year. Some of the cost reductions that we've had this year as I mentioned in my prepared remarks are not sustainable. We want to be meeting with our customers and some things that are just logistically hard to do. So how do those net out? We'll go into the year planning to try to hold margins at the operating line to close to where they are now with the gross margins going up giving us some cover for the operating expense going up a little bit. But that's just an early framework. Hey, Jason, it's David. I'll tell you that what our teams are seeing is while you do see \u2013 you do see lockdowns in many countries around Europe they feel different from the first time around. And most of them are accommodating to project work, like what our customers do, that were for a while, sort of, out of operation in the spring. So you never say never, that it might tighten down. But surprisingly, our distributors and our end customers have been remarkably able to do their work even in this second wave. Hey, Rob, it's David Barnes. So as you look at the revenue line you can see that the volume of business we're serving is going down. So the restructuring in part simply recognizes that the business has contracted and smaller than it was. A lot of the strategy we're working through to improve customer retention and customer satisfaction is about streamlining the product offering, replacing old technology with more supportable technologies going forward. So when you support fewer platforms, you need less resource over time. The inventory write-down specifically was about products that were committed to when the business was bigger and more healthy and we've worked through our strategy with regard to customer targeting and pricing. And we've recognized that the inventory valuation -- we've updated it to reflect that plan. So we're not \u2013 we haven't exited any businesses per se. We're optimizing the business that we've got and as Rob said, aiming for the inflection point where on all the key metrics of ARR and revenue growth and margins we can get momentum toward what a good business looks like in Trimble in the second half of next year. No that's right. No we haven't exited any business. We're still serving the customers' needs just doing it more efficiently with products that are fit for the future."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Trimble Second Quarter Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And please be advised that today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker for today Mr. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nRob Painter: Good afternoon everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Despite difficult circumstances in the second quarter, our team rose to the occasion. I\u2019m deeply grateful for the ingenuity and commitment to outcomes demonstrated by my colleagues and our worldwide network of partners over these last few months. What I said on our call in May remains true today. That is, we will get through this crisis. We are well-positioned to endure the macroeconomic shock. And we will emerge stronger on the other side of this. Our belief in our long-term strategy remains undiminished. Slide two lists the five key messages we want to convey today. First, our resilience, the quality of our strategy and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the second quarter. ARR, at $1.21 billion, adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.7% and deferred revenue at $531 million were clear highlights. Our shift to a more hardware connected, software-centric, and recurring revenue business model is paying off. Second, the decisive financial and strategic actions we took in March have put us in a position to restore employee pay as of August and senior executive pay shortly thereafter. I thank all my colleagues for their professionalism and demonstrated commitment. These last few months have strengthened our culture. Third, we take our responsibility to address racial injustice and climate change seriously. Speaking personally, I have a heightened sense of awareness that has strengthened my resolve to leverage our platform to lead Trimble to a different place. We have been public in our stance against racial injustice. We established a diversity equity and inclusion working group, representing both senior leadership in Trimble as well as advocates appointed from within the organization. We have also donated money through our Trimble Foundation to causes that align with our values and we remain humbled to know that we have a lot more to do. With respect to climate change, we are pleased to have named Leah Lambertson, our Head of Operations, to a larger role where she now has additional responsibility as Head of Sustainability for Trimble. Fourth, we reiterate our focus to execute on our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. We will balance cost containment and investment in innovation during the downturn. We are connecting the industry lifecycles we serve such as construction, agriculture, utilities, and the transportation supply chain. By reporting segment, in a context of unprecedented conditions, we were satisfied with our progress in the quarter in three of our four segments. While we remain convinced of both the long-term market opportunity of our supply chain strategy as well as the viability of our strategy, we are currently performing below our potential in our Transportation segment. Earlier in the year, I set expectations of demonstrable financial recovery in the beginning of 2021. Given the environment and circumstances, we now believe the recovery will take longer than anticipated. In addition to the difficult macro and pandemic effects, which have suppressed demand, there are three discrete topics that impact our near-term results in Transportation. First, our acquisition of Kuebix, as we announced in February, remains strategically important but is currently dilutive. Kuebix takes us to the shipper market, which is key to our connected supply chain strategy. Second, we continue to execute a subscription business model transition in our enterprise business; and in our mobility business we launched a Hardware-as-a-Service offering. We have high conviction on these model transitions. Third, we continue to work through our Electronic Logging Device (ELD) product delivery commitments in our mobility business and are offering incentive programs to customers to upgrade older technology. Overall, we will take near-term actions to enhance our competitive position and will measure the success of our actions by delivering profitable ARR growth, enterprise bookings, and by growing the size and transaction volume in the shipper community. We are pleased that in our other three segments, Buildings and Infrastructure delivered solid ARR growth, offset by expected disruptions in our hardware sales and new perpetual software bookings. While we see projects coming back online, we also see uncertainty into 2021 for new projects and we are closely monitoring the impact of stimulus measures. Geospatial did an exceptional job managing expenses and finding available revenue opportunities in the quarter. And Resources and Utilities was led by growth in our Utilities business and positioning services business, and by relatively positive performance in the aftermarket agriculture business. Our fifth and last point, while short-term market uncertainty remains high, our long-term market conviction remains strong. We see green shoots in many of our markets and we believe the second quarter will mark the bottom of our revenue decline. Nevertheless, uncertainty prevails, and we do not believe it would be prudent to provide guidance for the balance of the year. I will turn the call over now to David to take us through the numbers.\nDavid Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let\u2019s start on slide three, with a review of second quarter results. Second quarter revenue was $735 million, down 14% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation subtracted 1%, and acquisitions and divestitures added 2%, for a total organic revenue decrease of 15%. Gross margin in the second quarter was 58.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by improved revenue mix. The introduction of higher margin new products and lower discounting also had a positive impact.  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.7%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, driven both by improvements in gross margin and strong cost control. Operating income margins also expanded 260 basis points to 23.1%. Net income dollars decreased by 2% on a year-over-year basis, while earnings per share fell by $0.01 to $0.52 per share. Moving to slide four, our second quarter cash flow from operations was $147 million, demonstrating the strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $135 million. We paid down over $140 million of debt in the quarter and the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 2.2 times. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.2 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $200 million in cash. In addition, we have no scheduled principal payments on our debt until July 2022. Our access to liquidity therefore remains strong. Given our strong and improving capital structure we are open to acquisition opportunities that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. We anticipate continued prioritization of debt reduction in the allocation of free cash flow, but will consider a modest return to share repurchases. Now, turning to slide five that highlight some of the key metrics we are following. First, I want to note that we have redefined our ARR metric. ARR now includes the annualized revenue of term licenses. Under GAAP the revenue from term licenses is recognized upfront rather than ratably, and for that reason, term licenses are excluded from the recurring revenue line that we report each quarter. But term licenses are renewable and recurring in nature and therefore share the fundamental economic characteristics of subscriptions. So, we believe that including term licenses in our ARR definition provides a more complete picture of our recurring business. Note that with this change, we have restated the ARR measure in prior periods, and that information is available in the financial summary document on our Investor Relations website. ARR was $1.21 billion in the second quarter and grew 6% versus prior year. Organic growth of ARR was 3%. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, represents approximately 1% of revenue on a trailing twelve months basis, demonstrating the working capital efficiency of our business. Through this period of proactive cost management we have continued to invest in key growth initiatives. One indicator of our investment posture can be seen in our R&D spending. Our trailing twelve months R&D is nearly 15% of revenue, and we believe our focus on innovation will enable us to emerge from this recession stronger than we entered it. Finally, I\u2019ll note progress against two metrics that point to the health of our business going forward. Deferred revenue is up 17% versus the end of the second quarter a year ago, and our backlog ended the second quarter at $1.2 billion, also up from the level of a year ago. As a reminder, backlog represents contractual commitments that will be recognized as revenue in the future. Most of the backlog represents the unrecognized value of subscription and maintenance agreements, but it also includes over $200 million from non-recurring revenue businesses. We expect the substantial majority of that backlog to convert to revenue in the next 12 months. Both of these metrics give us enhanced visibility into our revenue trends in the coming quarters. Moving to slide six, I\u2019ll elaborate a bit on Rob\u2019s earlier comments about the increasing diversity and resilience of our revenue base. Recurring revenues made up 39% of total Trimble revenue in the quarter, and grew by over 4% even in an extraordinarily difficult economic environment. Of our major sources of recurring revenue, only Transportation saw a decline in the quarter, for reasons Rob mentioned earlier. Our other major sources of recurring revenue including Viewpoint, e-Builder, Building Construction Software and positioning services collectively saw recurring revenue growth of greater than 10% in the second quarter. These offerings are essential to the continued operation of our customers\u2019 businesses even in the toughest of times. By contrast, our non-recurring revenues, including hardware, perpetual software, and professional services, experienced meaningful year-on-year declines in the second quarter. These businesses were adversely impacted by project suspensions, OEM factory shutdowns, and restricted access to our clients\u2019 facilities. While many of these restrictions eased late in the second quarter, our overall non-recurring business remains meaningfully below year-ago levels as we enter the third quarter. Looking at geography, the results in the quarter were largely correlated with impacts from COVID in terms of shutdowns and the pace of reopening. The COVID-related dynamics in North America and Europe were similar, with business conditions very poor in April and improving through the quarter. North America was down 17% and Europe was down 13%, with a significant difference being North America\u2019s higher weighting in the Transportation segment. Asia-Pacific was the best performer in the quarter, up 1%. Rest of World was down 19%, driven principally by difficult business conditions in Brazil and the weakening of the Brazilian currency. Turning now to slide seven, we take a deeper look at each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was down 12% on an organic basis. Recurring revenue growth was particularly strong in Viewpoint, e-Builder and SketchUp. Hardware, perpetual software license, and professional services revenues were down greater than 20% in the quarter. Segment margins expanded 400 basis points due to higher margin revenue mix and cost reductions. Geospatial revenue was down 11% on an organic basis, with non-recurring revenue down in the mid-teens and recurring revenue experiencing growth. Margins were up 680 basis points. Resources and Utilities revenue was down 13% on an organic basis. Growth from the Utilities business, including Cityworks, helped offset some of the decline in agriculture revenue. Margin expansion of 440 basis points was driven by improved revenue mix and cost reductions. Transportation revenue was down 24% on an organic basis and margins declined 710 basis points. The adverse trends in the Transportation segment were driven by the factors Rob mentioned earlier. Turning to slide eight and the outlook for the third quarter, we continue to face significant uncertainty in the demand trends in our core markets driven by the risk of COVID-related restrictions and the broader impact of the pandemic on the economy. Therefore, we lack the visibility in the business that is needed to put forth a guidance range. However, I can provide some color on trends that we are seeing in our business and the markets we serve. Overall, we expect that revenue in the third quarter will be down on a year-over-year basis, albeit at a rate of decline more moderate than we experienced in the second quarter. We anticipate that revenues in the Resources and Utilities segment will grow in the third quarter versus prior year due to the relative resilience of these end markets, the fact that we are comparing against a tough 2019, and the addition of Cityworks. We project that revenue in both the Buildings and Infrastructure and Geospatial segments will be below prior year. The Transportation segment will experience the greatest revenue declines in the third quarter, driven by the same factors, which adversely impacted second quarter performance. Looking at our trends by revenue type, we anticipate continued growth in recurring revenues due to the resilience of these offerings and the ongoing conversions to subscriptions across our software businesses. By contrast, our non-recurring revenues are likely to continue to decline in the third quarter, albeit at a slower rate than we experienced in the second quarter. We expect gross margins to continue their expansion on a year-over-year basis due to increased software mix, although we don\u2019t expect that gross margins will remain as strong as we experienced in the second quarter. Turning to operating expense, note that spending in the second quarter was extraordinarily low across our business. We anticipate that operating expense will be higher in the third quarter than in the second quarter. We estimate that the revenue and margin dynamics will result in year- over-year decremental margins in the mid-30s. I\u2019ll add here that we remain committed to maintaining healthy operating margins going into 2021. Our view is that 2021 will be characterized by only slow and gradual economic recovery. We continue to evaluate our business portfolio and look to exit those businesses which are peripheral to our strategy or don\u2019t meet our financial objectives. In terms of cash, we expect cash flow to be down on a year-over-year basis in the second half due to the drop in revenue and EBITDA. Nevertheless, we continue to expect operating cash flow will exceed non-GAAP net income for the full year, and we expect slightly lower capital expenditures for the year. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Rob.\nRob Painter: Let me close by talking about key elements of Connect & Scale 2025 and our progress in the quarter, which I will describe in four elements. First, connecting solutions across our industry lifecycles; two examples here. In Transportation, we announced further integration with Kuebix between shippers and the Trimble carrier network. In construction, we press released a win with SNCF in France to manage railway construction assets and building construction data. Second, delivering breakout innovation that connects the physical and digital worlds. We launched a couple of analytics offerings in our construction business, leveraging our content and project jobsite data to enable customers to optimize project delivery. Near and dear to me, the Government of Nepal completed fieldwork for measuring Mt. Everest\u2019s height using Trimble GNSS equipment. Third, accelerating our business model transformation. In Transportation, we began offering hardware as part of subscription bundles. In our Utilities business, we announced an IoT Solutions-as-a-Service offering for remote monitoring of water and wastewater infrastructure. And here in the third quarter, we will introduce our machine control Platform-as-a-Service initiative, which we announced earlier in the year at ConExpo. Fourth, we are taking actions that enable us to efficiently and effectively scale our business. We divested a small seismic business in the quarter, we have shrunk our real estate office footprint by 30 offices year-to-date, and we have increased our spend and focus on our digital fulfillment systems initiative. With that, I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to be with us today and a special thank you to our global Trimble colleagues. Operator, let\u2019s please go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAnn Duignan: Yes. Hi, good afternoon everybody. Just a couple of clarifications. You ran through the Q3 guidance so quickly, I find myself scrambling. Could you restate what you said about your expectations for ARR into Q3 versus nonrecurring revenue? And then putting all the pieces together, given lower gross margin, lower -- higher operating expense, would you expect adjusted earnings to be down quarter-over-quarter in Q3? \nDavid Barnes: Hi Ann, David Barnes. So, yes, we expect ARR to continue to grow in the back half of the year and in the third quarter, because those businesses are resilient and the conversions continue. Non-recurring revenues will be down, so that results in the total being down lower than -- but not down as much as in Q2. Gross margins probably won't come in, in Q3 as good as Q2. Operating expense will go up a little bit. So, Ann, we're not certainly signaling increasing dollars operating profit. \nAnn Duignan: And why would you expect gross margins to be down in Q3 if ARR is going to continue to grow?\nDavid Barnes: Well, gross margins will be up year-on-year for a lot of reasons, none big, but many cumulative. As you've seen, Q2 was a very high gross margin period. So, we do think gross margins will be above prior year, but probably not higher than Q2.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the Transportation side, could you just dig into that segment a little bit more and tell us what do you think is are cyclical issues versus are there any structural issues that we need to be concerned about? I mean, ELD has been a weight on Transportation for a while now. How should we think about that maybe beyond this year and into 2021? \nRob Painter: Hi Ann, this is Rob. So, when I think about the macro of the end markets we serve, I would say, transportation, particularly -- specifically North America, transportation is certainly the most challenged at the moment. There is, I think, as you know, a supply/demand imbalance, which is creating pricing pressure on the carriers. And that actually started in 2019 and was playing through to the beginning of the year. I think the market probably expected balance to come back there on the pricing side and then the pandemic set that back. So, I look at the macro backdrop in transportation and I put at least half of the delta to that macro backdrop and that also includes trucking companies idling some assets. And so if you're idling some assets that could have adverse impact on our units serving those trucking companies, at least in the near-term. So, let's say, a view forward for some quarters or the couple of quarters or maybe the next year. So, that exists that backdrop. And then just to reiterate a couple of points from the prepared remarks. In our Enterprise business, so the back office software or transportation management system, we are intentionally engaging in a model transition, so moving from perpetual to a subscription offering. And that is emphatically the right thing to do for the business, for the market, for the customers, and as we all know, has short-term negative impacts to the P&L. So, we're offering -- we are offering both models, and we're seeing almost two-thirds - actually, it's above thirds of our new bookings are coming from subscription offering. So, the more we're driving that subscription offering, the subscription bookings, that does create a near-term -- a near-term drag. And then the last bit I talked about was the Kuebix acquisition, which takes us to the shipper side of the transportation market, which was when we announced it in February, we did announce it as a dilutive deal. So that hangs heavier in a market that is down. So, those are the majority factors. And then yes, we also talked about ELD itself and continuing to work our customers through the migration. And now Canada ELD comes after the U.S.\nAnn Duignan: And the ELD issue should be resolved by end of this year? And then I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Yes, I think it would be fair to say that from the end of this year and I mean it will probably bleed into the beginning of next year as well, working through those -- working through our product commitments.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. Thank you. In the interest of time, I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nRob Painter: Thanks Ann.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon everyone.\nRob Painter: Hey Jerry.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could just update us on the performance of e-Builder and Viewpoint since you folks -- ownership. Can you just talk about the growth in logos that you folks have delivered? What kind of win rate for new logos has the team delivered? Can you just frame the performance for us over the past year plus and especially over the past quarter?\nRob Painter: Yes. And for those who may not know, Viewpoint and e-Builder are two acquisitions from a couple of years ago that are in our Buildings and Infrastructure space. They continue to perform very well. So, very pleased with the respective management teams and what they're delivering since they've been a part of Trimble. To give you a bit of quantitative to overlay that qualitative. In the second quarter, ARR grew in the mid-teens for both of those businesses. So, I would say that's emphatic demonstration of the strategy working and the business model working. When we look at new logos that those businesses have driven in the last couple of years. If we look at e-Builder, about two-thirds of the ARR growth has been through new logos. So, it's also a good sign of driving new growth since being part of Trimble. And then on the Viewpoint side, it's been about one-third new logo and two-thirds from existing customers, and that makes sense because we are transitioning the model there to a subscription model, whereas e-Builder was already a subscription model. And then to connect the dots to that, if you look at new logo wins, it's around our RFP type win ratios, they're around 50%. And the majority of times when we don't get a deal, it's from a no decision. So, hopefully, that gives you some color, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: I appreciate it, Rob. And then what stood out was the growth in deferred revenue this quarter, was that because bookings were stronger than ARR? Can you talk about that or was there any acquisition impact in the quarter?\nDavid Barnes: Yes, there is some acquisition impact in there, Jerry, but the bigger portion of that is the ARR growth and the health of the recurring businesses, both subscriptions and maintenance and support.\nJerry Revich: And then it was nice to hear about two-thirds of the Transportation back office customers signing up for the subscription offerings. Can you talk about growth in the addressable market that you're seeing? Obviously, not a lot of orders in April, but I'm wondering any conclusions that we could draw from what's going on in June, July in terms of how much the subscription offering is helping you folks expand the tail, so to speak?\nRob Painter: Yes, it's a good question. What we can see and what we've learned from other businesses where we've made the transition is it certainly does expand the addressable market. I'll use our SketchUp business and construction as an example, and we had another quarter of over 50% year-on-year unit growth. And that, to me, is a tremendous sign of -- and a clear sign of expanding the addressable market. If we look at Transportation, the fundamentals there would be taking us predominantly from the larger carriers into the medium-size carriers who are not going to want to have a, call it, a custom implementation. So, they're going to want more of a standard configuration out of the box offering. So, there's a logic to it. And so we do see ourselves reaching a set of customers that we weren't reaching before. But I'd also say that the largest subscription bookings we've had in the last, I think it was three quarters, was from a very large carrier. So it does seem to be attractive to both segments. \nJerry Revich: Appreciate the discussion. Thanks.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital. \nJason Celino: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. To build off the subscription offerings, it sounds like you also announced another as a service offering for your Utility segment. But for those two new announcements you made, what's been kind of the feedback from customers? And then for those particular products, how should we think of pace of kind of the -- that transition? \nRob Painter: Sure. I'd say it's pretty early days to give a quantitative view of how they are performing in the market. I can say qualitatively, they were customer-driven initiatives that we made to make the move to the subscription, the subscription offering. And I use them as an example to show really, across the board at Trimble that we're looking to the business model conversion.  I mean, one, in a down market, we all know moving from CapEx to OpEx has a financial advantage. We talked on the last question about the expansion of the addressable market that we believe that we can see through this. And then there's the pursuit of our -- the connect part of the Connect & Scale strategy. being able to connect the data, being able to connect stakeholders across the industry continuums, we really believe in the pursuit of the strategy that to connect the data, which is really where we think there's huge optionality going forward as you connect the data a business model transition and is an enabler to be able to get data back to the cloud. And so there's both strategic and financial reasons that have us very motivated and committed to this. And so yes, I was wanting to show examples from parts of the company, you don't often hear us talking about or elements such as hardware of changing the business model that we haven't talked about before as signals of just how serious we are about this. So, time will tell on customer pickup and so we can certainly come back to that in future calls. \nJason Celino: Okay, great. And one quick follow-up, if I can. A lot of other software companies have been talking about their customers accelerating different digital investments. Was the strength in Viewpoint and e-Builder this quarter due to that or why couldn't the construction end market see this also?\nRob Painter: I have to say, you're very faint. It's hard to hear you, so I missed the question. \nJason Celino: Okay. Let me try to speak a little louder. A lot of other software companies are talking about customers accelerating different digital investments. Was the strength in the quarter from Viewpoint and e-Builder due to that? And then why couldn't the construction end market see that also?\nRob Painter: Got you. Well, for sure, at a secular level, we believe there's an acceleration of digital. And it's and you look at what we do as Trimble, the connection of the physics solutions that connect the physical and the digital worlds, and really the in essence, we're digitizing markets such as construction, agriculture, transportation. So, we believe at a secular level that we're in the right place. We've seen some of the -- I'll use Viewpoint as an example, some of the acceleration in that ARR. And then the bookings we had this quarter were customers who had on-prem -- on-prem software, weren't able to get connectivity they wanted. And so we actually did some lift and shifts during the quarter to help our customers. And that has a side benefit of course, once they've seen how the software operates in the cloud, we've seen them, by and large, want to stick to that delivery method. Now, in the short-term, we have the disruptions of being able to actually access customers. And so I would separate the very near-term from the mid to long-term in terms of the digitization secular. So long-term, I think it's there. In the short-term, new logos have certainly been harder to reach from the new bookings that we've had. And again, that has a certain logic to it. And we saw new bookings trends in the quarter and the second quarter move from quite negative at the beginning of the quarter and progressively move better through until the end of the quarter and here into July. So, hopefully, it gives you a little bit of color how we see it on both sides. \nJason Celino: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you, operator. Hi guys. Rob, just following on your last answer there. I think you're through the quarter progress on new logos or new customers was construction related. Transportation obviously had a tough quarter. Could you talk about the non-hardware side through the quarter there? And whether there's any of that similar digital push really taking hold?\nRob Painter: And you mean specifically in transportation, Rob?\nRob Wertheimer: Correct. \nRob Painter: In our -- in the Enterprise Business, we saw bookings progress better throughout the quarter. Well look, that's software -- software-oriented, of course, in the enterprise business. I would say a bright spot there. I think if we look at the -- kind of elevate back a second, when we look at some of the macros, which I know you know well, whether it's truckload line haul indices or shipment indexes or Class eight unit sales, those were all pretty negative in the quarter, maybe even historically negative. Now, by the end of the quarter in June, it looks like those indices may have bottomed. We saw spot rates increase. If you look -- compare April to July, Class orders were up in June. And so if we see that freight demand coming back, then let's -- we feel like the market's got at least an incrementally better backdrop than it did in the first couple of months of Q2.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. And if I can just ask maybe a different one, but you took a really prudent approach to this economy, which is highly uncertain. How is your appetite, if an acquisition appears? I mean, do you feel like that just is on hold because, who knows how the world works out over the next year or so? Or is Trimble actively looking? I mean, what's your current feeling on willingness to do that? Thanks.\nRob Painter: Sure. Well, from a financial perspective -- a financial strength perspective, you look at the net debt to EBITDA, and we're in a strong and healthy position. You know the working capital was less than 1% of revenue in the quarter, producing strong cash flow, over $500 million of deferred revenue on the books. So, we have the financial wherewithal to pursue an acquisition. If I move to the -- that's a financial answer. From a strategic perspective, it really is a function of not pursuing acquisitions for the sake of acquisitions, but really in the pursuit of executing the strategies. And so what I would signal is that we have an openness to it, but it's also not meant to be a signal that you're about to hear something meaningful or big, given what we -- the commentary we had in the last call about pulling back on acquisitions and buyback. We just wanted to be transparent that given where we see ourselves now and we saw Q2 as the trough of the revenue decline, that we would be open. And so we are open in the context of, particularly, I'd say, in the construction space, number one, in the overall segment. Secondarily, would be, I'd probably say in the agriculture space, but there's not actually really too many deals, I would say, to be done in that space.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nColin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. Can you give some more granular sense of what you're seeing in construction? I really love to get a sense of public projects versus private projects as well as buildings versus infrastructure. We've seen some softening in June and July. Just would love to get some color on that from you guys as you move into 3Q.\nRob Painter: Sure, hi Colin. So, if we look at -- I would break it down by type of projects on one dimension and the other current and future. And the punchline is we see current work coming back online, and much of it never went offline and what went offline has, by and large, come back online. And then from a future perspective, we see customers with some concern about the 2021 pipeline. And we're all watching to see what happens with infrastructure, what happens with the FAST Act, will that get renewed in September, or will it be continuing resolution, that pushes that out, what will be -- will there be a backstop on state DoT funding or there's a number of factors that are impacting the view on the future that hopefully get resolved here shortly. If I then look at the type of construction, let's take residential, non-residential and civil, I would say, non-residential, the data would show that's been hit the hardest. And if we look at civil, that's been impacted by about half of what the non-res numbers have been impacted by. And so when we look at the segments that we serve across the value chain and construction, if we looked at a market such as architecture and design, we would look at the ABI data and ABI data would tell us that the number of the June stabilized after the April, May decline. So, that does look more positive. Now, multi-residentials look more positive than commercial and industrial, which, again, that also makes sense. And I would note that in our SketchUp business, we grew units over 50% year-over-year. So it didn't play into -- whatever the number was, that didn't play into our business. And if we look at general contractors in that segment, we can see from our own systems because we can see how our customers are at a macro or meta level, we can see how the systems are being used, and we can see the current activity is solid, and we can see that project backlogs are currently down. And then if we look at owners and occupiers of that we serve or occupiers of buildings, where we serve occupiers of buildings, they're looking to be more efficient with their space management, and that fits nicely with one of the technologies that we have to help you manage space more efficiently. So, that historically is a business that's grown the most during down markets. In our e-Builder business, we've seen verticals such as data centers or government have been good. And of course, markets like retail are not good. So, it differs within the segments. And then civil, again, we're watching to see what happens with the project starts and with the project bids. And that's an answer in the U.S. But if you go around the world, you see places or places like in the U.K., HS2 has come back or was greenlighted and is back to work, and we've seen some good performance in a few other markets outside of the U.S. as well.\nColin Rusch: That's incredibly helpful. Thank you. Just a follow-up just briefly on customer engagement through the pandemic response, are you seeing more of your non-software customers showing interest in discussing some of the enterprise solutions? And I'm just trying to get a sense of that migration and how much of that is even more of a push effort and how much is a pull effort from the customers?\nRob Painter: Well, one indicator, especially when we have our SaaS businesses, we can measure the intensity of the usage of the software and at the beginning of the quarter in Q2, not surprisingly, we saw large dips from late March into April. And then we saw -- and we've seen since then, quite intensive usage. And that's important for us. It also plays through by the way, through the net retention we've seen in ratio and a number of the software businesses. And hey, I think maybe the work at home is positively impacting the usage of the system because we have remote access to be able to continue to do the work. In terms of engaging new customers, I mean, like most companies -- or all companies, we're certainly shifting the nature of digital engagement and how we reach customers and we're all learning new ways of sales and marketing. And I'd say, so far, we've seen some really nice pockets of success. I'll give you one example. In Brazil, we did a virtual trade show a few months ago that had 3,000 attendees. And we would never get 3,000 attendees in an in-person demonstration, and we did it for a couple of thousand dollars. I mean, that's an incredible ROI from a digitally engaged. I will say on some of the hardware solutions, there are aspects of seeing is believing and the ability to be out there in the field is important. Now, there, we luckily have a worldwide network of dealer partners and our hardware predominant businesses. And they have been up and running. And really, while it's still difficult, let's say, to operate in the restricted environments, that's fundamentally different than if we were having -- if that was all direct sales, and we had to be on airplanes to do it because we wouldn't be able to be out there. So, having that channel in the hardware business is proving at the moment to be, yet again, very positive for us.\nColin Rusch: Thank you so much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is open.\nRichard Eastman: Yes, thank you. Thanks for the question. Rob, could we just talk for a second about the op profit in B&I and Geospatial. What I'm kind of looking at is, in B&I, the op profit was up $25 million quarter-to-quarter on flat sales, so from Q1 to Q2? And Geospatial was kind of plus $8 million op profit on flat sales in Geospatial. And is that -- could you just perhaps suggest to us or give us some feel for what the cost takeout or just cost control did sequentially versus the mix there?\nRob Painter: Well, if we look at the costs, and David can add on to this, as you know, we did the pay reductions in the quarter. But actually, if we look at the fundamental drivers of the cost delta in the business, we saw travel and entertainment was the largest drop, not surprisingly and that was across the board. We saw things like health care expenses go significantly down, not surprising. People weren't going to the doctor. So, those played in to the overall numbers. So, now if we're looking specifically within the reporting segments, okay. So, there are some nuances there. And I think you're asking, Rick, about ND&I compared to Geospatial OpEx, the sequential down Q1 to Q2?\nRichard Eastman: Yes, I just again, I'm just looking at the dollar increase in op profit versus the revenue being flat quarter-to-quarter? And it's pretty substantial in the B&I business, $25 million more in profit on flat sales from Q1 to Q2. And obviously, there would be a cost component to that. But again, quite frankly, I'm just thinking for modeling purposes. As we move forward, we have more of a software recurring revenue mix there. I would think year-over-year, certainly, but sequentially, it's a rather significant increase in op profit.\nRob Painter: Yes. And there's an element that's going to play through with the gross margins being higher, so on -- even on flat revenue, that's going to be a help in both of the businesses. And then after -- and there's about an 800 bps delta in the gross margins between those segments. And then from an OpEx point of view, David, do you want to add to that?\nDavid Barnes: Yes, I'll just add to what Rob said. So, we -- obviously, for the whole company, gross margins went up Q1 to Q2 and up year-on-year. And that's more pronounced in Buildings and Infrastructure, where the hardware pieces of the business were weaker and the software were stronger for all the factors Rob mentioned. But that phenomenon occurred in Geospatial as well. We had a really positive revenue mix. So, what you're seeing on the operating margin line in those two segments is the positive confluence of improved gross margins year-on-year and meaningful reductions in operating expenditure across every category. It's people, no one went to the doctor, travel basically was zero, as I'm sure is true in many of your companies and really across the board, operating expense was low. So, as we indicated, the operating expense levels, as you think forward and after Q2, they can't be sustained at that low level. So they will gradually go up, albeit not to the pre-pandemic levels.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. Okay. And then just a second question on the BIM business, could you just characterize how Europe performed in the BIM business in the quarter?\nRob Painter: Really quite similar to the Rest of the World. I wouldn't say there's anything that particularly stood out in Europe. And we do have a bit more of a Nordic and a U.K. concentration. Nordic did better, not surprisingly.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. Okay, very good. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi from Berenberg. Your line is open.\nAndrew DeGasperi: Thank you. I just wanted to ask a question, again, on transportation, particularly the weakness. Could you maybe elaborate if any of that was due to competition? We know that Samsara has been particularly aggressive. I'm just wondering if that played a role in the weak -- in the downtick in revenues.\nRob Painter: Well, I would -- the way I'd characterize it is go back that there's the element of the macro impact but let is at least half of where we see the delta. But let's talk a little bit about the nature of the market right now. And so the ELD mandate certainly attracted a lot of capital to the industry. And I would say not all of that capital was with smart capital, and we've seen some early shakeout in the market with some of the technology providers, whether they've exited the market or there's been reductions in force from some companies. So, now you apply that and you look at the customers themselves and if you got a pricing imbalance that's pinching carriers at the moment; that is going to increase some of the competitive pressure. And the nature of how we've seen some of the competition in the market shift is really -- I'll give you an example -- a product example is the bundling of the hardware with the software. And by and large, that is now how the market has moved because you have companies, like ourselves, but I'll say, other companies, younger companies, wanting to get the long tail subscription growth. And so that is certainly -- I've been talking about this for a few calls, that certainly negatively impacted the competitive environment, the hardware margins and it has that wrapping it now into the subscription. And so one of our announcements was that I had in the press release was moving hardware as a subscription offering. So, we do have that available to our customers. And in aggregate, that does have some net impact on the cash flow of the business because instead of taking that hardware revenue upfront, we'll wrap it into the subscription over time. Now, on a cumulative base, it'll also be fine over time to have a cumulative cash flow growth. That's ultimately even a better measure than ARR, cumulative cash flow.\nAndrew DeGasperi: That's helpful. And just a follow-up on your -- on the Hardware-as-a-Service. Can you tell us what the duration is of that subscription on average?\nRob Painter: Typically three years. I mean, you can have one year or three years, but we typically are aiming for three years.\nAndrew DeGasperi: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your last question comes from Rich Valera from Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nRichard Valera: Thank you. One more question on Transportation, if I could. So Rob, the quarter-over-quarter decline in Transportation was obviously pretty severe and abrupt, about $20 million down quarter-over-quarter. And from what I'm hearing, it sounds like you're expecting a gradual recovery, perhaps just a little bit in Q3. And I would assume that looking out over the next several quarters, that's the way to think about it, that we're not likely to get back any of that revenue in chunks to the upside and that we should think about this as more of a gradual recovery, perhaps from the what I would think is the trough in Q2. \nRob Painter: That's a good way to think about it, yes.\nRichard Valera: Great. And then just one more, if I could, on the OpEx, which you have talked about. So, that was -- so OpEx was down a very impressive almost $20 million, I guess, quarter-over-quarter, Q1 to Q2 and understand that's not sustainable. But any color at all on how much of that we kind of think we give back in Q2? I mean do we give back half that, a third of it, any color on that at all, it would be appreciated. Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: Yes, this is David. That depends a little bit on how the market evolves and the virus and everything. I think it's safe to say, OpEx will be up, but nowhere near by the amount that it was down in the second quarter. Many of the factors that constrained OpEx on travel and a number of discretionary spending areas will continue to be meaningfully down. So, it will be up -- I'd say, up modestly from Q2 to Q3. \nRob Painter: And in addition, we would also see some FX.\nDavid Barnes: That's right. The U.S. dollar has weakened considerably. So, just the FX rates, a lot of our cost is outside the U.S. So that will put upward pressure on OpEx.\nRichard Valera: Got it, okay. Thank you gentlemen. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And we don't have any further questions at this time. I will now turn it over to Mr. Michael Leyba, Director of Investor Relations.\nMichael Leyba: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Good afternoon everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Despite difficult circumstances in the second quarter, our team rose to the occasion. I'm deeply grateful for the ingenuity and commitment to outcomes demonstrated by my colleagues and our worldwide network of partners over these last few months. What I said on our call in May remains true today. That is, we will get through this crisis. We are well-positioned to endure the macroeconomic shock. And we will emerge stronger on the other side of this. Our belief in our long-term strategy remains undiminished. Slide two lists the five key messages we want to convey today. First, our resilience, the quality of our strategy and the strength of our financial model enabled us to outperform our own expectations in the second quarter. ARR, at $1.21 billion, adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.7% and deferred revenue at $531 million were clear highlights. Our shift to a more hardware connected, software-centric, and recurring revenue business model is paying off. Second, the decisive financial and strategic actions we took in March have put us in a position to restore employee pay as of August and senior executive pay shortly thereafter. I thank all my colleagues for their professionalism and demonstrated commitment. These last few months have strengthened our culture. Third, we take our responsibility to address racial injustice and climate change seriously. Speaking personally, I have a heightened sense of awareness that has strengthened my resolve to leverage our platform to lead Trimble to a different place. We have been public in our stance against racial injustice. We established a diversity equity and inclusion working group, representing both senior leadership in Trimble as well as advocates appointed from within the organization. We have also donated money through our Trimble Foundation to causes that align with our values and we remain humbled to know that we have a lot more to do. With respect to climate change, we are pleased to have named Leah Lambertson, our Head of Operations, to a larger role where she now has additional responsibility as Head of Sustainability for Trimble. Fourth, we reiterate our focus to execute on our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. We will balance cost containment and investment in innovation during the downturn. We are connecting the industry lifecycles we serve such as construction, agriculture, utilities, and the transportation supply chain. By reporting segment, in a context of unprecedented conditions, we were satisfied with our progress in the quarter in three of our four segments. While we remain convinced of both the long-term market opportunity of our supply chain strategy as well as the viability of our strategy, we are currently performing below our potential in our Transportation segment. Earlier in the year, I set expectations of demonstrable financial recovery in the beginning of 2021. Given the environment and circumstances, we now believe the recovery will take longer than anticipated. In addition to the difficult macro and pandemic effects, which have suppressed demand, there are three discrete topics that impact our near-term results in Transportation. First, our acquisition of Kuebix, as we announced in February, remains strategically important but is currently dilutive. Kuebix takes us to the shipper market, which is key to our connected supply chain strategy. Second, we continue to execute a subscription business model transition in our enterprise business; and in our mobility business we launched a Hardware-as-a-Service offering. We have high conviction on these model transitions. Third, we continue to work through our Electronic Logging Device (ELD) product delivery commitments in our mobility business and are offering incentive programs to customers to upgrade older technology. Overall, we will take near-term actions to enhance our competitive position and will measure the success of our actions by delivering profitable ARR growth, enterprise bookings, and by growing the size and transaction volume in the shipper community. We are pleased that in our other three segments, Buildings and Infrastructure delivered solid ARR growth, offset by expected disruptions in our hardware sales and new perpetual software bookings. While we see projects coming back online, we also see uncertainty into 2021 for new projects and we are closely monitoring the impact of stimulus measures. Geospatial did an exceptional job managing expenses and finding available revenue opportunities in the quarter. And Resources and Utilities was led by growth in our Utilities business and positioning services business, and by relatively positive performance in the aftermarket agriculture business. Our fifth and last point, while short-term market uncertainty remains high, our long-term market conviction remains strong. We see green shoots in many of our markets and we believe the second quarter will mark the bottom of our revenue decline. Nevertheless, uncertainty prevails, and we do not believe it would be prudent to provide guidance for the balance of the year. I will turn the call over now to David to take us through the numbers. Let me close by talking about key elements of Connect & Scale 2025 and our progress in the quarter, which I will describe in four elements. First, connecting solutions across our industry lifecycles; two examples here. In Transportation, we announced further integration with Kuebix between shippers and the Trimble carrier network. In construction, we press released a win with SNCF in France to manage railway construction assets and building construction data. Second, delivering breakout innovation that connects the physical and digital worlds. We launched a couple of analytics offerings in our construction business, leveraging our content and project jobsite data to enable customers to optimize project delivery. Near and dear to me, the Government of Nepal completed fieldwork for measuring Mt. Everest's height using Trimble GNSS equipment. Third, accelerating our business model transformation. In Transportation, we began offering hardware as part of subscription bundles. In our Utilities business, we announced an IoT Solutions-as-a-Service offering for remote monitoring of water and wastewater infrastructure. And here in the third quarter, we will introduce our machine control Platform-as-a-Service initiative, which we announced earlier in the year at ConExpo. Fourth, we are taking actions that enable us to efficiently and effectively scale our business. We divested a small seismic business in the quarter, we have shrunk our real estate office footprint by 30 offices year-to-date, and we have increased our spend and focus on our digital fulfillment systems initiative. With that, I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to be with us today and a special thank you to our global Trimble colleagues. Operator, let's please go to Q&A. Hi Ann, this is Rob. So, when I think about the macro of the end markets we serve, I would say, transportation, particularly -- specifically North America, transportation is certainly the most challenged at the moment. There is, I think, as you know, a supply/demand imbalance, which is creating pricing pressure on the carriers. And that actually started in 2019 and was playing through to the beginning of the year. I think the market probably expected balance to come back there on the pricing side and then the pandemic set that back. So, I look at the macro backdrop in transportation and I put at least half of the delta to that macro backdrop and that also includes trucking companies idling some assets. And so if you're idling some assets that could have adverse impact on our units serving those trucking companies, at least in the near-term. So, let's say, a view forward for some quarters or the couple of quarters or maybe the next year. So, that exists that backdrop. And then just to reiterate a couple of points from the prepared remarks. In our Enterprise business, so the back office software or transportation management system, we are intentionally engaging in a model transition, so moving from perpetual to a subscription offering. And that is emphatically the right thing to do for the business, for the market, for the customers, and as we all know, has short-term negative impacts to the P&L. So, we're offering -- we are offering both models, and we're seeing almost two-thirds - actually, it's above thirds of our new bookings are coming from subscription offering. So, the more we're driving that subscription offering, the subscription bookings, that does create a near-term -- a near-term drag. And then the last bit I talked about was the Kuebix acquisition, which takes us to the shipper side of the transportation market, which was when we announced it in February, we did announce it as a dilutive deal. So that hangs heavier in a market that is down. So, those are the majority factors. And then yes, we also talked about ELD itself and continuing to work our customers through the migration. And now Canada ELD comes after the U.S. Yes, I think it would be fair to say that from the end of this year and I mean it will probably bleed into the beginning of next year as well, working through those -- working through our product commitments. Thanks Ann. Hey Jerry. Yes. And for those who may not know, Viewpoint and e-Builder are two acquisitions from a couple of years ago that are in our Buildings and Infrastructure space. They continue to perform very well. So, very pleased with the respective management teams and what they're delivering since they've been a part of Trimble. To give you a bit of quantitative to overlay that qualitative. In the second quarter, ARR grew in the mid-teens for both of those businesses. So, I would say that's emphatic demonstration of the strategy working and the business model working. When we look at new logos that those businesses have driven in the last couple of years. If we look at e-Builder, about two-thirds of the ARR growth has been through new logos. So, it's also a good sign of driving new growth since being part of Trimble. And then on the Viewpoint side, it's been about one-third new logo and two-thirds from existing customers, and that makes sense because we are transitioning the model there to a subscription model, whereas e-Builder was already a subscription model. And then to connect the dots to that, if you look at new logo wins, it's around our RFP type win ratios, they're around 50%. And the majority of times when we don't get a deal, it's from a no decision. So, hopefully, that gives you some color, Jerry. Yes, it's a good question. What we can see and what we've learned from other businesses where we've made the transition is it certainly does expand the addressable market. I'll use our SketchUp business and construction as an example, and we had another quarter of over 50% year-on-year unit growth. And that, to me, is a tremendous sign of -- and a clear sign of expanding the addressable market. If we look at Transportation, the fundamentals there would be taking us predominantly from the larger carriers into the medium-size carriers who are not going to want to have a, call it, a custom implementation. So, they're going to want more of a standard configuration out of the box offering. So, there's a logic to it. And so we do see ourselves reaching a set of customers that we weren't reaching before. But I'd also say that the largest subscription bookings we've had in the last, I think it was three quarters, was from a very large carrier. So it does seem to be attractive to both segments. Sure. I'd say it's pretty early days to give a quantitative view of how they are performing in the market. I can say qualitatively, they were customer-driven initiatives that we made to make the move to the subscription, the subscription offering. And I use them as an example to show really, across the board at Trimble that we're looking to the business model conversion.  I mean, one, in a down market, we all know moving from CapEx to OpEx has a financial advantage. We talked on the last question about the expansion of the addressable market that we believe that we can see through this. And then there's the pursuit of our -- the connect part of the Connect & Scale strategy. being able to connect the data, being able to connect stakeholders across the industry continuums, we really believe in the pursuit of the strategy that to connect the data, which is really where we think there's huge optionality going forward as you connect the data a business model transition and is an enabler to be able to get data back to the cloud. And so there's both strategic and financial reasons that have us very motivated and committed to this. And so yes, I was wanting to show examples from parts of the company, you don't often hear us talking about or elements such as hardware of changing the business model that we haven't talked about before as signals of just how serious we are about this. So, time will tell on customer pickup and so we can certainly come back to that in future calls. I have to say, you're very faint. It's hard to hear you, so I missed the question. Got you. Well, for sure, at a secular level, we believe there's an acceleration of digital. And it's and you look at what we do as Trimble, the connection of the physics solutions that connect the physical and the digital worlds, and really the in essence, we're digitizing markets such as construction, agriculture, transportation. So, we believe at a secular level that we're in the right place. We've seen some of the -- I'll use Viewpoint as an example, some of the acceleration in that ARR. And then the bookings we had this quarter were customers who had on-prem -- on-prem software, weren't able to get connectivity they wanted. And so we actually did some lift and shifts during the quarter to help our customers. And that has a side benefit of course, once they've seen how the software operates in the cloud, we've seen them, by and large, want to stick to that delivery method. Now, in the short-term, we have the disruptions of being able to actually access customers. And so I would separate the very near-term from the mid to long-term in terms of the digitization secular. So long-term, I think it's there. In the short-term, new logos have certainly been harder to reach from the new bookings that we've had. And again, that has a certain logic to it. And we saw new bookings trends in the quarter and the second quarter move from quite negative at the beginning of the quarter and progressively move better through until the end of the quarter and here into July. So, hopefully, it gives you a little bit of color how we see it on both sides. And you mean specifically in transportation, Rob? In our -- in the Enterprise Business, we saw bookings progress better throughout the quarter. Well look, that's software -- software-oriented, of course, in the enterprise business. I would say a bright spot there. I think if we look at the -- kind of elevate back a second, when we look at some of the macros, which I know you know well, whether it's truckload line haul indices or shipment indexes or Class eight unit sales, those were all pretty negative in the quarter, maybe even historically negative. Now, by the end of the quarter in June, it looks like those indices may have bottomed. We saw spot rates increase. If you look -- compare April to July, Class orders were up in June. And so if we see that freight demand coming back, then let's -- we feel like the market's got at least an incrementally better backdrop than it did in the first couple of months of Q2. Sure. Well, from a financial perspective -- a financial strength perspective, you look at the net debt to EBITDA, and we're in a strong and healthy position. You know the working capital was less than 1% of revenue in the quarter, producing strong cash flow, over $500 million of deferred revenue on the books. So, we have the financial wherewithal to pursue an acquisition. If I move to the -- that's a financial answer. From a strategic perspective, it really is a function of not pursuing acquisitions for the sake of acquisitions, but really in the pursuit of executing the strategies. And so what I would signal is that we have an openness to it, but it's also not meant to be a signal that you're about to hear something meaningful or big, given what we -- the commentary we had in the last call about pulling back on acquisitions and buyback. We just wanted to be transparent that given where we see ourselves now and we saw Q2 as the trough of the revenue decline, that we would be open. And so we are open in the context of, particularly, I'd say, in the construction space, number one, in the overall segment. Secondarily, would be, I'd probably say in the agriculture space, but there's not actually really too many deals, I would say, to be done in that space. Sure, hi Colin. So, if we look at -- I would break it down by type of projects on one dimension and the other current and future. And the punchline is we see current work coming back online, and much of it never went offline and what went offline has, by and large, come back online. And then from a future perspective, we see customers with some concern about the 2021 pipeline. And we're all watching to see what happens with infrastructure, what happens with the FAST Act, will that get renewed in September, or will it be continuing resolution, that pushes that out, what will be -- will there be a backstop on state DoT funding or there's a number of factors that are impacting the view on the future that hopefully get resolved here shortly. If I then look at the type of construction, let's take residential, non-residential and civil, I would say, non-residential, the data would show that's been hit the hardest. And if we look at civil, that's been impacted by about half of what the non-res numbers have been impacted by. And so when we look at the segments that we serve across the value chain and construction, if we looked at a market such as architecture and design, we would look at the ABI data and ABI data would tell us that the number of the June stabilized after the April, May decline. So, that does look more positive. Now, multi-residentials look more positive than commercial and industrial, which, again, that also makes sense. And I would note that in our SketchUp business, we grew units over 50% year-over-year. So it didn't play into -- whatever the number was, that didn't play into our business. And if we look at general contractors in that segment, we can see from our own systems because we can see how our customers are at a macro or meta level, we can see how the systems are being used, and we can see the current activity is solid, and we can see that project backlogs are currently down. And then if we look at owners and occupiers of that we serve or occupiers of buildings, where we serve occupiers of buildings, they're looking to be more efficient with their space management, and that fits nicely with one of the technologies that we have to help you manage space more efficiently. So, that historically is a business that's grown the most during down markets. In our e-Builder business, we've seen verticals such as data centers or government have been good. And of course, markets like retail are not good. So, it differs within the segments. And then civil, again, we're watching to see what happens with the project starts and with the project bids. And that's an answer in the U.S. But if you go around the world, you see places or places like in the U.K., HS2 has come back or was greenlighted and is back to work, and we've seen some good performance in a few other markets outside of the U.S. as well. Well, one indicator, especially when we have our SaaS businesses, we can measure the intensity of the usage of the software and at the beginning of the quarter in Q2, not surprisingly, we saw large dips from late March into April. And then we saw -- and we've seen since then, quite intensive usage. And that's important for us. It also plays through by the way, through the net retention we've seen in ratio and a number of the software businesses. And hey, I think maybe the work at home is positively impacting the usage of the system because we have remote access to be able to continue to do the work. In terms of engaging new customers, I mean, like most companies -- or all companies, we're certainly shifting the nature of digital engagement and how we reach customers and we're all learning new ways of sales and marketing. And I'd say, so far, we've seen some really nice pockets of success. I'll give you one example. In Brazil, we did a virtual trade show a few months ago that had 3,000 attendees. And we would never get 3,000 attendees in an in-person demonstration, and we did it for a couple of thousand dollars. I mean, that's an incredible ROI from a digitally engaged. I will say on some of the hardware solutions, there are aspects of seeing is believing and the ability to be out there in the field is important. Now, there, we luckily have a worldwide network of dealer partners and our hardware predominant businesses. And they have been up and running. And really, while it's still difficult, let's say, to operate in the restricted environments, that's fundamentally different than if we were having -- if that was all direct sales, and we had to be on airplanes to do it because we wouldn't be able to be out there. So, having that channel in the hardware business is proving at the moment to be, yet again, very positive for us. Well, if we look at the costs, and David can add on to this, as you know, we did the pay reductions in the quarter. But actually, if we look at the fundamental drivers of the cost delta in the business, we saw travel and entertainment was the largest drop, not surprisingly and that was across the board. We saw things like health care expenses go significantly down, not surprising. People weren't going to the doctor. So, those played in to the overall numbers. So, now if we're looking specifically within the reporting segments, okay. So, there are some nuances there. And I think you're asking, Rick, about ND&I compared to Geospatial OpEx, the sequential down Q1 to Q2? Yes. And there's an element that's going to play through with the gross margins being higher, so on -- even on flat revenue, that's going to be a help in both of the businesses. And then after -- and there's about an 800 bps delta in the gross margins between those segments. And then from an OpEx point of view, David, do you want to add to that? Really quite similar to the Rest of the World. I wouldn't say there's anything that particularly stood out in Europe. And we do have a bit more of a Nordic and a U.K. concentration. Nordic did better, not surprisingly. Well, I would -- the way I'd characterize it is go back that there's the element of the macro impact but let is at least half of where we see the delta. But let's talk a little bit about the nature of the market right now. And so the ELD mandate certainly attracted a lot of capital to the industry. And I would say not all of that capital was with smart capital, and we've seen some early shakeout in the market with some of the technology providers, whether they've exited the market or there's been reductions in force from some companies. So, now you apply that and you look at the customers themselves and if you got a pricing imbalance that's pinching carriers at the moment; that is going to increase some of the competitive pressure. And the nature of how we've seen some of the competition in the market shift is really -- I'll give you an example -- a product example is the bundling of the hardware with the software. And by and large, that is now how the market has moved because you have companies, like ourselves, but I'll say, other companies, younger companies, wanting to get the long tail subscription growth. And so that is certainly -- I've been talking about this for a few calls, that certainly negatively impacted the competitive environment, the hardware margins and it has that wrapping it now into the subscription. And so one of our announcements was that I had in the press release was moving hardware as a subscription offering. So, we do have that available to our customers. And in aggregate, that does have some net impact on the cash flow of the business because instead of taking that hardware revenue upfront, we'll wrap it into the subscription over time. Now, on a cumulative base, it'll also be fine over time to have a cumulative cash flow growth. That's ultimately even a better measure than ARR, cumulative cash flow. Typically three years. I mean, you can have one year or three years, but we typically are aiming for three years. That's a good way to think about it, yes. And in addition, we would also see some FX."

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Let's start on slide three, with a review of second quarter results. Second quarter revenue was $735 million, down 14% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation subtracted 1%, and acquisitions and divestitures added 2%, for a total organic revenue decrease of 15%. Gross margin in the second quarter was 58.9%, up 200 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by improved revenue mix. The introduction of higher margin new products and lower discounting also had a positive impact.  Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.7%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, driven both by improvements in gross margin and strong cost control. Operating income margins also expanded 260 basis points to 23.1%. Net income dollars decreased by 2% on a year-over-year basis, while earnings per share fell by $0.01 to $0.52 per share. Moving to slide four, our second quarter cash flow from operations was $147 million, demonstrating the strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $135 million. We paid down over $140 million of debt in the quarter and the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 2.2 times. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.2 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $200 million in cash. In addition, we have no scheduled principal payments on our debt until July 2022. Our access to liquidity therefore remains strong. Given our strong and improving capital structure we are open to acquisition opportunities that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. We anticipate continued prioritization of debt reduction in the allocation of free cash flow, but will consider a modest return to share repurchases. Now, turning to slide five that highlight some of the key metrics we are following. First, I want to note that we have redefined our ARR metric. ARR now includes the annualized revenue of term licenses. Under GAAP the revenue from term licenses is recognized upfront rather than ratably, and for that reason, term licenses are excluded from the recurring revenue line that we report each quarter. But term licenses are renewable and recurring in nature and therefore share the fundamental economic characteristics of subscriptions. So, we believe that including term licenses in our ARR definition provides a more complete picture of our recurring business. Note that with this change, we have restated the ARR measure in prior periods, and that information is available in the financial summary document on our Investor Relations website. ARR was $1.21 billion in the second quarter and grew 6% versus prior year. Organic growth of ARR was 3%. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, represents approximately 1% of revenue on a trailing twelve months basis, demonstrating the working capital efficiency of our business. Through this period of proactive cost management we have continued to invest in key growth initiatives. One indicator of our investment posture can be seen in our R&D spending. Our trailing twelve months R&D is nearly 15% of revenue, and we believe our focus on innovation will enable us to emerge from this recession stronger than we entered it. Finally, I'll note progress against two metrics that point to the health of our business going forward. Deferred revenue is up 17% versus the end of the second quarter a year ago, and our backlog ended the second quarter at $1.2 billion, also up from the level of a year ago. As a reminder, backlog represents contractual commitments that will be recognized as revenue in the future. Most of the backlog represents the unrecognized value of subscription and maintenance agreements, but it also includes over $200 million from non-recurring revenue businesses. We expect the substantial majority of that backlog to convert to revenue in the next 12 months. Both of these metrics give us enhanced visibility into our revenue trends in the coming quarters. Moving to slide six, I'll elaborate a bit on Rob's earlier comments about the increasing diversity and resilience of our revenue base. Recurring revenues made up 39% of total Trimble revenue in the quarter, and grew by over 4% even in an extraordinarily difficult economic environment. Of our major sources of recurring revenue, only Transportation saw a decline in the quarter, for reasons Rob mentioned earlier. Our other major sources of recurring revenue including Viewpoint, e-Builder, Building Construction Software and positioning services collectively saw recurring revenue growth of greater than 10% in the second quarter. These offerings are essential to the continued operation of our customers' businesses even in the toughest of times. By contrast, our non-recurring revenues, including hardware, perpetual software, and professional services, experienced meaningful year-on-year declines in the second quarter. These businesses were adversely impacted by project suspensions, OEM factory shutdowns, and restricted access to our clients' facilities. While many of these restrictions eased late in the second quarter, our overall non-recurring business remains meaningfully below year-ago levels as we enter the third quarter. Looking at geography, the results in the quarter were largely correlated with impacts from COVID in terms of shutdowns and the pace of reopening. The COVID-related dynamics in North America and Europe were similar, with business conditions very poor in April and improving through the quarter. North America was down 17% and Europe was down 13%, with a significant difference being North America's higher weighting in the Transportation segment. Asia-Pacific was the best performer in the quarter, up 1%. Rest of World was down 19%, driven principally by difficult business conditions in Brazil and the weakening of the Brazilian currency. Turning now to slide seven, we take a deeper look at each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was down 12% on an organic basis. Recurring revenue growth was particularly strong in Viewpoint, e-Builder and SketchUp. Hardware, perpetual software license, and professional services revenues were down greater than 20% in the quarter. Segment margins expanded 400 basis points due to higher margin revenue mix and cost reductions. Geospatial revenue was down 11% on an organic basis, with non-recurring revenue down in the mid-teens and recurring revenue experiencing growth. Margins were up 680 basis points. Resources and Utilities revenue was down 13% on an organic basis. Growth from the Utilities business, including Cityworks, helped offset some of the decline in agriculture revenue. Margin expansion of 440 basis points was driven by improved revenue mix and cost reductions. Transportation revenue was down 24% on an organic basis and margins declined 710 basis points. The adverse trends in the Transportation segment were driven by the factors Rob mentioned earlier. Turning to slide eight and the outlook for the third quarter, we continue to face significant uncertainty in the demand trends in our core markets driven by the risk of COVID-related restrictions and the broader impact of the pandemic on the economy. Therefore, we lack the visibility in the business that is needed to put forth a guidance range. However, I can provide some color on trends that we are seeing in our business and the markets we serve. Overall, we expect that revenue in the third quarter will be down on a year-over-year basis, albeit at a rate of decline more moderate than we experienced in the second quarter. We anticipate that revenues in the Resources and Utilities segment will grow in the third quarter versus prior year due to the relative resilience of these end markets, the fact that we are comparing against a tough 2019, and the addition of Cityworks. We project that revenue in both the Buildings and Infrastructure and Geospatial segments will be below prior year. The Transportation segment will experience the greatest revenue declines in the third quarter, driven by the same factors, which adversely impacted second quarter performance. Looking at our trends by revenue type, we anticipate continued growth in recurring revenues due to the resilience of these offerings and the ongoing conversions to subscriptions across our software businesses. By contrast, our non-recurring revenues are likely to continue to decline in the third quarter, albeit at a slower rate than we experienced in the second quarter. We expect gross margins to continue their expansion on a year-over-year basis due to increased software mix, although we don't expect that gross margins will remain as strong as we experienced in the second quarter. Turning to operating expense, note that spending in the second quarter was extraordinarily low across our business. We anticipate that operating expense will be higher in the third quarter than in the second quarter. We estimate that the revenue and margin dynamics will result in year- over-year decremental margins in the mid-30s. I'll add here that we remain committed to maintaining healthy operating margins going into 2021. Our view is that 2021 will be characterized by only slow and gradual economic recovery. We continue to evaluate our business portfolio and look to exit those businesses which are peripheral to our strategy or don't meet our financial objectives. In terms of cash, we expect cash flow to be down on a year-over-year basis in the second half due to the drop in revenue and EBITDA. Nevertheless, we continue to expect operating cash flow will exceed non-GAAP net income for the full year, and we expect slightly lower capital expenditures for the year. Now, I'll turn it back to Rob. Hi Ann, David Barnes. So, yes, we expect ARR to continue to grow in the back half of the year and in the third quarter, because those businesses are resilient and the conversions continue. Non-recurring revenues will be down, so that results in the total being down lower than -- but not down as much as in Q2. Gross margins probably won't come in, in Q3 as good as Q2. Operating expense will go up a little bit. So, Ann, we're not certainly signaling increasing dollars operating profit. Well, gross margins will be up year-on-year for a lot of reasons, none big, but many cumulative. As you've seen, Q2 was a very high gross margin period. So, we do think gross margins will be above prior year, but probably not higher than Q2. Yes, there is some acquisition impact in there, Jerry, but the bigger portion of that is the ARR growth and the health of the recurring businesses, both subscriptions and maintenance and support. Yes, I'll just add to what Rob said. So, we -- obviously, for the whole company, gross margins went up Q1 to Q2 and up year-on-year. And that's more pronounced in Buildings and Infrastructure, where the hardware pieces of the business were weaker and the software were stronger for all the factors Rob mentioned. But that phenomenon occurred in Geospatial as well. We had a really positive revenue mix. So, what you're seeing on the operating margin line in those two segments is the positive confluence of improved gross margins year-on-year and meaningful reductions in operating expenditure across every category. It's people, no one went to the doctor, travel basically was zero, as I'm sure is true in many of your companies and really across the board, operating expense was low. So, as we indicated, the operating expense levels, as you think forward and after Q2, they can't be sustained at that low level. So they will gradually go up, albeit not to the pre-pandemic levels. Yes, this is David. That depends a little bit on how the market evolves and the virus and everything. I think it's safe to say, OpEx will be up, but nowhere near by the amount that it was down in the second quarter. Many of the factors that constrained OpEx on travel and a number of discretionary spending areas will continue to be meaningfully down. So, it will be up -- I'd say, up modestly from Q2 to Q3. That's right. The U.S. dollar has weakened considerably. So, just the FX rates, a lot of our cost is outside the U.S. So that will put upward pressure on OpEx."

As always our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Before we start walking through the slides, we want to acknowledge that this is an extremely challenging and uncertain time for all of us and that everyone listening has their own unique set of circumstances they are dealing with. While these calls are designed for our investors our employees are also active listeners. In fact over 40% of our employees are shareholders. As such these updates speak to both audiences. In our current environment, we lead with a moral principle to support the health and safety of our community including employees, customers, and dealer partners. We also lead with a strategic principle to keep our business moving forward.  We have customers and partners who rely on Trimble to keep their businesses running to move the goods of commerce, to feed the global population, to build and maintain our infrastructure, and more. With heartfelt gratitude and by the level of dedication and resolve from our over 11,500 Trimble colleagues, a worldwide network of dealer partners and our customers. As a leadership team, we activated a comprehensive global business continuity plan in early March. The vast majority of Trimble is working remotely and we are in the process of defining when and how we gradually return to our office environments. The ongoing economic impact to Trimble will correlate to when and how we and our customers establish a set of new normal working conditions. While it feels like we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, the fact remains that there is still a great deal of uncertainty. The essence of our planning has been to plan for the worst-case scenario and hope for the best. We took early and decisive action and I'm incredibly proud of how our team has rallied together as one Trimble. We will get through this crisis. We are well-positioned to endure the macroeconomic shock and we will emerge stronger on the other side of this. While we are managing the short-term realities, we are also equally focused on executing our long-term strategy. Let's shift to the presentation. Slide two has the seven key messages we want to address today. As I've just highlighted our team has risen to the challenge and this is point one. Point two, our first quarter results exceeded expectations demonstrating the quality of the Trimble strategy and the financial strength in the first 11 weeks of the quarter, A big thank you to the Trimble team. Point three our balance sheet and access to liquidity remain emphatically strong. Point four, as we look to the past to inform the actions of today, the multi-year execution of our strategy and the transformation of our business model has established more resiliency than at any point in our history. Point five; we took early and decisive management actions including increasing liquidity and implementing broad-based temporary pay reductions to fortify the business. My commitment to our Trimble team is to restore pay as soon as possible. Point six, we are suspending guidance and we will be as transparent as we can with the puts and takes we are seeing in the market and in our business. Point seven, the cumulative actions we have taken enable us to stay true to our long-term strategy Connect & Scale 2025. No changes. Moving to slide three, the message here is that our business is essential and our team is leading. My opening comments addressed much of what is on this slide. Before I turn it over to David, slide four offers a few examples of how Trimble is helping our customers and communities during this time. In our transportation business our team is offering a free service to display and collect current truck stop status and amenity information. We are also offering free driver trip planning to suggest open truck stops and rest areas. Our leasing team has put together programs that are enabling customers to extend payment terms. In our communities I'd like to highlight our Cityworks team which is offering a web-based GIS-centric platform for local governments to manage their emergency response efforts. David?\nDavid Barnes: Thanks Rob. Turning to slide five, non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter was $794 million in the middle of our guidance range despite greater-than-anticipated weakness in demand late in the quarter as the pandemic impact widened. I'll note that Q1 revenue reflects outstanding management of the supply chain disruption coming out of China. We exceeded our initial expectations in fulfillment of customer demand despite the fact that the shutdowns in China were more severe and longer-lasting than we anticipated when we issued guidance in mid-February. Total revenue growth for the quarter was minus 1% which included minus 2% from organic growth and approximately minus 1% from changes in exchange rates as the U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter. Acquisitions added about 2% to revenue during the quarter. Our recurring revenue was strong with annualized recurring revenue or ARR up 7% year-on-year and up 6% on an organic basis. Note that this represents about a 1% acceleration from ARR performance in Q4 of 2019. Gross margins, operating margins, net income and EPS improved versus prior year and EPS came in well above our guidance range. Margins improved during the quarter for a number of reasons. Gross margins were higher year-on-year driven principally by an improvement in mix, as our higher margin software businesses performed relatively well during the quarter. Lower levels of discounting and the introduction of higher end new hardware products also improved margins. As the impending weakness in the economy became apparent, we pulled back on discretionary spending, including travel and outside services and we reduced our rate of hiring. In addition, our expense relating to incentive and commission plans was reduced meaningfully during the quarter. Note that the temporary pay reductions Rob mentioned in his remarks did not take effect until the last week of Q1, so we will see the vast majority of that cost benefit beginning in Q2. Turning to slide six. We are showing here revenue and profit trends by segment, and I'll touch on the factors, which are expected to drive the sector businesses going forward. The Resources and Utilities segment had a strong revenue and profit quarter driven by demand in the agricultural sector for aftermarket products and correction services. Late in the quarter our OEM business was impacted by factory shutdowns, but end customer demand proved to be solidly resilient through the quarter. Revenue trends were aided late in the quarter by customers buying product in anticipation of shutdowns in distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our Buildings and Infrastructure segment had organic growth in the quarter driven by our civil business and growth in our recurring revenue offerings. The organic growth occurred despite March weakness in project starts and bookings. With some notable exceptions most ongoing construction project activity continued despite COVID-19-related work restrictions. The Geospatial business got off to a strong start in the quarter driven by new products and by the timing of dealer orders. March results were much weaker both because dealers drew down inventories and because demand began to weaken with the decline in oil prices and the implementation of shelter-in-place rules. Transportation revenue was weak in the quarter, driven in part by the factors we discussed in our Q4 2019 release. As you will recall, we have experienced challenges related to the implementation of the ELD mandate in our telematics business. Revenue trends weakened further in March as the COVID-19 crisis took hold. During the quarter we made significant progress in addressing product functionality gaps and partly as a result, we are seeing lower churn coming out of the quarter. Going forward we plan to accelerate the transformation to higher-performing hardware across our customers' fleets. While these steps will put continued pressure on margins this year, we believe they will position the business for stability later this year in growth as the market returns to more normal conditions. The transportation market in Q1 was a meaningful turmoil relating to the pandemic. Providers to food retailers saw a significant spike in demand, while trucking companies supporting capital goods or energy markets experienced a significant reduction in freight demand. Overall, our business was impacted in March by a deterioration in market conditions and a decline in the number of trucks on the road. I'll note here that our maps business, which has a recurring revenue model saw strong demand through the quarter. One additional observation about the timing of revenue trends within Q1, revenue growth was strong through the first two months of the quarter and then weakened in March as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. Revenue growth was in the high single-digits through the first two months of the quarter and then was down in the mid-teens in March. I'd also like to comment briefly on the trends we have seen in our business after the full COVID-19 crisis hit in March. I'll start with our recurring revenue, which remains strong even in this period of facility shutdowns and economic weakness. Customer retention so far is in line with our pre-crisis experience. Our enterprise systems are critical for our clients' operations. Approximately 75% of our recurring revenue offerings represent field or enterprise software used day in and day out in the course of our customers' businesses. So as long as our customers remain in business and project activity continues then our products are essential. In fact usage of many of our systems has grown since the crisis intensified. We are however seeing a delay in bookings of recurring software as customers rethink their priorities and cope with facility shutdowns, but this will have only a small impact on our revenue in 2020 and we are holding our share of the new awards that are coming through. Our non-recurring revenue businesses are unsurprisingly experiencing more adverse trends since the COVID-19 crisis expanded in March. Our OEM hardware business, which collectively makes up less than 15% of revenue have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of many of our customers' production facilities. Hardware sales have been adversely hampered by work restrictions at our dealers and at their customers, while much of our professional service business has been impacted by the lack of access to our clients' people and facilities. Encouragingly, we entered Q2 with over $1.2 billion of backlog. Of this amount roughly $250 million is from our non-recurring revenue businesses up versus the same period last year. We expect the majority of that backlog to convert to revenue this year. Turning now to slide seven. Our cash flow balance sheet and access to liquidity remains strong. During Q1, we generated $156 million of cash flow from operations, up 5% from the prior year. We ended the quarter with $217 million of cash. We have renegotiated terms of an outstanding term loan to extend the maturity from July of 2021 to July of 2022. As you can see from the table, we anticipate no principal due on any of our outstanding debt for the next two years. We also have over $1 billion of untapped borrowing capacity on our credit facility. Our outstanding debt is rated investment-grade by both Moody's and S&P with stable outlooks from both agencies. Moody's just reaffirmed their rating and stable outlook in a report issued last week. We finished Q1 with financial ratios comfortably in compliance with our credit line covenants. We have a strong primary focus on ensuring credit facility compliance and access to liquidity as we model potential scenarios for our business in the coming quarters. Our business generates significant cash flow, consistently in excess of earnings even in times of economic downturn. Our financial modeling shows that the business would continue to generate significant free cash flow even in environment of revenue reduction significantly worse than what we saw in the global financial crisis. In summary, our balance sheet is strong and we have taken action to further strengthen our capital structure as the COVID-19 crisis has unfolded. The current capital structure and the demonstrated ability of our business model to generate cash even under adverse scenarios gives us the platform to weather the crisis and to continue to execute our strategy. Turning now to slide eight. I'd like to point your attention to several ways in which our business model has evolved since the beginning of the last two phases of real weaknesses in our end markets, the global financial crisis at the end of 2008 and the commodity price declines of several years ago. Note that in 2008, hardware represented nearly 90% of Trimble revenues, and that the Geospatial segment made up just under half of our business. This revenue mix left us highly vulnerable to reductions in capital spend in a number of markets, especially oil and gas. With this business mix Trimble revenue declined 15% in 2009. In the last 12 years, our model has evolved significantly with hardware now making up less than half of our revenue and our sector and geographic diversification leaves us better able to withstand any focused reduction in capital spending activity. As I noted earlier, the one-third of our business with the recurring revenue model is holding up well through the first months of the COVID-19 crisis. The point here is that our business model is more resilient than ever with a more diversified and stable revenue mix. Turning now to slide nine. I'll talk about efforts we have undertaken across a number of areas to fortify our business for the recession we now see coming. From a capital allocation perspective, we've taken a number of steps to ensure that our balance sheet remains strong. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program and put a hold on significant new acquisitions until we can see clear signs of recovery in our business and end markets. As I noted earlier, we have negotiated an extension on the scheduled maturity of an existing term loan. From a cost perspective, we have taken action on a number of fronts. These actions include an immediate reduction in discretionary spend like travel, lower forecasted payouts on our incentive plans, the elimination of our planned annual salary increase, and a broad-based temporary salary reduction program. The salary reduction program, which took effect just as Q1 ended reduces our payroll base of $200 million per quarter by approximately 10%. Note that, the reductions were implemented in a progressive approach. Many of our frontline workers receive no reduction at all while our CEO, Board of Directors and senior leadership team have accepted temporary reductions of 50%. Of the $20 million per quarter salary savings approximately 75% or $15 million per quarter will show up in operating expense with the remainder in cost of goods sold. The salary savings when combined with our other cost reduction initiatives have reduced our quarterly run rate of operating expenses by roughly $30 million per quarter lower than the first quarter 2020 run rate and $50 million per quarter when compared with our pre-COVID 2020 plan. From a supply chain perspective, we plan to keep doing what worked well for us in Q1 as we managed the disruptions in China. Our team has shown an ability to be creative and flexible in responding to whatever disruptions we see in the market and we will constantly readjust our plans to ensure that we meet evolving customer demand. Now, I will turn it back over to Rob to talk about our views looking forward.\nRob Painter: Let's move to slide 10. While we are suspending our second quarter and total year guidance, we also want to be transparent and talk about the areas where we have more and less visibility. David described a number of ways in which our business was impacted in March as the economic slowdown took hold. I'll expand on those comments and give you some thoughts on how we see our business trending in the second quarter. The overall performance of the quarter will correlate to the opening up of global economies and the return of more normalized demand patterns. The areas of the business model where we have the most visibility and confidence includes ARR, gross margins, and operating expenses. ARR represents approximately one-third of our total revenue. In the second quarter, we expect this to be up in the low single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. We'd also expect to see modest gross margin expansion as our revenue is increasingly weighted towards software-centric revenue. Relative to operating expenses, David covered the cost containment actions we took. In our non-recurring revenue businesses, new hardware demand and new logo software bookings growth has been depressed during the shelter-in-place time. We are digitally engaging with prospective customers and building our pipeline, but the fact remains that the rate of deal closure levels are below what we experienced at the beginning of the year. Looking at our reporting segments and taking a view of the puts and takes in the end markets, we have a point of view on the relative performance we expect across the segments. On a year-over-year basis, we expect revenue in all reporting segments to be down in the second quarter. We expect resources and utilities to outperform amongst the segments driven by our correction services and utilities businesses. On the other side, we expect Geospatial to underperform amongst the segments given the hardware centricity of the reporting segment. Turning to our last slide. I want to step back for a moment and revisit two of the three first principles we established upfront during the crisis. We said, we would protect and strengthen the core of Trimble and position ourselves to exit the crisis in a stronger competitive position. The underlying investment thesis of Trimble is stronger than ever. That is the digitization of end markets that are historically underserved and underpenetrated with technology that delivers productivity, quality, safety, visibility and environmental sustainability to our customers. With that backdrop, our long-term shareholders expect us to deliver long-term sustainable value. We believe we have taken the responsible short-term actions to confidently weather the crisis, which allows us to stay focused on our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy, which we believe is more relevant than ever. The takeaway here is that we will play offense on core elements of our strategy, in particular the transition to subscription revenue models across our business. We will also continue to invest in business processes and systems to accelerate the strategic transformation. As evidenced, we are pulling forward some of our transitions into 2020 and 2021. For example, we launched our transportation management system as a subscription offering and we now see more than half of our new bookings being subscriptions instead of perpetual license offerings. As another important example at CONEXPO in February, we announced what we are calling Trimble Platform as a Service that bundles our machine control and guidance kit along with Trimble productivity software into a subscription offering. Customers will benefit from technology assurance and a platform that can be feature upgraded. They also benefit by converting to an OpEx model and being able to more easily charge machine time to specific projects. We further connect this job cost information with our viewpoint construction ERP system and our works OS platform that bring together data elements from other Trimble and non-Trimble technology into a single tool to remotely manage productivity and uptime of the site. In our agriculture business, we are now offering bundles of our guidance hardware along with our software and correction services. The aim is to make ourselves easier to do business with and to reduce friction in the buying process. Next our strategy guides us to further connect our industry life cycles. As evidence of our progress in the construction market, we expect Trimble Connect to reach 10 million users in the second quarter and we currently have over 80,000 active multiuser projects being managed in Connect. This user base provides us a platform to deepen our customer engagement over time and more importantly than ever provides an environment for them to continue to collaborate on projects from anywhere. Finally, we have not pulled back our R&D efforts and we will continue our 40-plus year history of innovation. Two examples I want to share here. First at CONEXPO, we announced our Earthworks 2.0 system that enables extensibility of the base platform. For example, we launched automated horizontal steering capabilities, which advances our progress on the path to autonomy. Using this platform, we demonstrated remote control capabilities and operated a set of equipment in Dayton, Ohio from the show floor in Las Vegas. Second, in our correction services business, the team achieved a great milestone in the quarter, completing a multiyear effort, deploying our RTX Fast technology across the contiguous U.S. parts of Southern Canada and much of Western Europe. We now cover nearly five million square miles with RTX Fast capability, which allows users to realize one centimeter accuracy in less than one minute via Internet or satellite broadcast. RTX Fast is ideally suited for autonomous on-road and off-road applications. To conclude, I would like to thank everyone for your time and your support and a special thank you to our global Trimble colleagues. Operator, let's please go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAnn Duignan: Hi, good afternoon, I guess. It\u2019s afternoon your time as well as ours. So good to hear all of you. My first question is around the resource business and it really performed significantly better than we had anticipated or forecasted. Can you just talk a little bit about what actually happened there? And how sustainable the margins are there? Or whether it was a one-off rollout of some new product? Thank you.\nRob Painter: So yes, there was a few factors that contributed to the outperform in the quarter, which includes some of the following. So it wasn't early planting season overall, which we think helped the business to some degree. To the credit of the team the new product introductions that have come out in the last month seem to be doing well in the market and we think that that contributed. The other part that's in Resources and Utilities as a reporting segment is our correction services business, as well as a set of utility and local government businesses we have. Our correction services business had a very strong first quarter which we believe also correlated not only to the health of the business but the early planting season. And then our utilities business has been coming along nicely and the Cityworks acquisition that we completed a few months ago is off to a nice start. So a number of factors came together in the reporting segment to set up a next quarter.\nAnn Duignan: And if Q1 was supported by the early planting, does that mean that the margins have peaked for the year despite everything else that's going on but seasonally we would expect Q1 margins to be the strongest?\nRob Painter: Yes that's a good point, Ann and that would be correct.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. And then on Buildings and Infrastructure, how lack -- how little visibility do you really have on the hardware side in that business just given what's going on with construction, equipment, production and then sales? I know you listed it as a risk in one of the further out slides. But if you could just address where do you see the greatest risk to your business in Buildings and Infrastructure? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Well, there's certainly less visibility into the hardware business than the recurring revenue, software we have in the reporting segment. If I take it from an angle of sentiment from customers, I would say we're hearing mixed reports from customers so far. On the positive side, we came in -- as we came into the first quarter, our customers had backlog and the sentiment was strong. And then as the virus took hold, projects clearly slowed down or halted and that was a negative at the end of the quarter. So here in the next few, I'll say weeks or months, as our customers get back to work, we expect, I'd say the hardware side of the business to proverbially come back to work as well. And now what I would say is we also hear some concern about work coming into looking forward into 2021. And then we also hear shift in sentiment as you would expect around some of the end market work. So something like commercial work or energy-related work will be difficult work such as hospitals or data centers would be good. So the mix of work is we expect to change as well.\nAnn Duignan: So if I have to rank order your customers in B&I, the construction equipment probably the weakest sentiment maybe your contractors next given the projects just stopped. And then maybe the later cycle the architects, et cetera may be a little bit less impacted at this point is that a fair characterization? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nRob Painter: That's pretty close. I'd say, I mean in the software businesses, overall the work we do is of essential nature. It's an ERP system you're either in business or you're not in -- the technology continues to be fundamental to the business and used. The -- then there is the next category I would take the construction equipment, let's say the contractors and then the third would be the OEM. So OEM-related revenue that we have I would put at the bottom of the list in the rank order.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. Appreciate the color. I\u2019ll get back in line. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nRob Wertheimer: Yes. Hi, and thank you for the question. It's interesting you're offering some new utilities to some of your customers to help deal with coronavirus in various ways, whether it'd be on the trucking side or just on the safety side. I'm a little bit curious, I mean, it's a tough saying that it's obviously an opportunity to potentially reach new customers. So is that expanding your reach? Is it mostly to existing folks that you have? Is it offering new features that they wouldn't have otherwise seen to them? And can you just give a little bit of a sense of how much that helps you expand?\nRob Painter: Well, the apps themselves are available to any company. So we didn't make a distinction of a customer not a customer. Now you'll probably get more value out of it if you are an existing customer and you're integrating into the bigger workflow. So I suspect there is a degree of let's say visibility or reach to potentially new customers but I should say it wasn't initiated as a marketing effort...\nRob Wertheimer: Yes. I didn't mean to imply I'm sorry. And then the second question I guess is just on defensiveness. Again, this is a little bit of a real-time test and how bad things can get. And I'm curious if it gives you a sense of how much trucking activity is down you probably do? And just whether you lose firms or customers or individual licenses? So, just a sense of the defensiveness as to how far the market to fall in trucking might be interesting. Thanks. I'll stop there.\nRob Painter: That's a good question, Rob. Certainly, the trucking market and well I say North America is certainly challenged at the moment and we see that the same data that you do whether it's the new Class eight units or now inventory levels or spot market rates. So it is a tough macro setup here in the near -- I'll say near to midterm for trucking companies. And David covered looking back at Q1, there were actually also some quite bright spots. And -- but looking forward, yes, I would say the macro is more negative at this point. Now when we think about the defensibility of the business, we actually also think this becomes a strength for Trimble. And so far, as we've got the value proposition and we've got the balance sheet to continue to be able to invest in this business, we've seen a couple of competitive companies either go out of the market or significantly cut back in the last couple of weeks. So from a competitive position, we'll continue to play offense in this business. We think we've got a winning strategy and we believe in the team that we have that's pursuing the strategy. So, we won't back off of let's say the pursuit of the business strategy. And we're confident that as we come out of this that we'll come out of it stronger. And that's really a major part of the orientation, we have as we really came into this is make sure that we position ourselves to exit the crisis on a stronger competitive footing than how we entered it.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is now open.\nRichard Eastman: Yes, good afternoon. Rob, could you -- I think in the guide you spoke to just some thoughts around the second quarter suggesting that really all four business groups would be down year-over-year in revenue. And just trying to sift through your commentary about weakening in March, are there any of the four business groups that might be expected to see revenue growth sequentially in the second quarter?\nRob Painter: Okay. So, if we think about the businesses sequentially in the second quarter, the short answer is, it wouldn't change my answer. I mean historically, you would expect to see construction especially civil construction coming on stronger in the second quarter given the summer season for construction. But we don't see that happening this in the second quarter. Otherwise, if you took a market let's say Resources and Utilities which is ag-centric, you would expect to see that seasonally decline in the second quarter if I use that as a sort of a contra example.\nRichard Eastman: Yes. And then Geospatial given the oil and gas exposure that's down sequentially and then transportation I guess you addressed. So -- okay. In your remarks Rob, you had mentioned that you can -- it feels like you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. And I'm just kind of curious, is that kind of a suggestion that you can maybe said differently you can see the bottom? Or what green shoots did you -- were you kind of looking at to suggest that?\nRob Painter: Well we stay in close contact not only with our dealer partners around the world, but our end customers and prospects and the pipeline that we have in the various businesses. If we look at a market let's say, if we take Asia, we can start to see business coming back in parts of Asia. So, if we take a market like China, now China is a small portion of Trimble these days less than 2% of revenue. But we have started to see business come back. If we look in the Nordics, we can start to see some of the business coming back as well. And so there's a bit of a geographic overlay to that Rick that informs the point of view that we feel like we're seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. As we look in North America and the governments are local -- and I'll say local governments are starting to talk about return to work or lifting some of the restrictions that it certainly plays into some of our psychology of seeing people getting back to work. They can be on the other end of that phone call for the demand side of this equation.\nRichard Eastman: I got you. Okay. And can I just ask one more question. I think, I just wanted to go back to the -- you had mentioned you're entering the second quarter with -- I think it was $1.2 billion -- $1.2 billion of backlog. And I didn't catch the rest of the comment. There was a reference to $250 million, but the strong backlog again defers no cancellations. I mean you're basically just seeing project pushouts. Is that...\nDavid Barnes: Hi Rick, it's David Barnes. Yes the $250 million is the backlog of our leading up the recurring business. And the point I made is that amount is higher than it was a year ago. And now we haven't seen any meaningful cancellations yet. There are as you inferred some delays but nothing in our backlog is being canceled of any consequence.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Devin Au from Keybanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nDevin Au: Hi. Thanks for taking our question. Just one for me. So I know you mentioned utility and construction are still performing. Just wondering if you could provide any color on other industries and geographies that you are seeing that are kind of underway back to normal level towards the end of I guess, April and thus far in May that you're seeing?\nRob Painter: Well the markets that we see coming back to some degree are in some of the Asian markets I'll use China as an example and in the Nordics in Europe where the couple of examples I pointed out that would be current time. If I look at Q1 itself, I can use Brazil as an example, where we had a strong quarter in Brazil both in the agriculture business but even more so in our transportation business in Brazil. And so there's pockets of performance around I'd say around the globe. I think you asked something -- I did miss the first part of the question around utilities can you repeat that?\nDevin Au: Yes. That was just kind of looking an example that are kind of performing pretty well in first quarter but I guess are you seeing other industries that are I guess on their way back to normal level thus far in the second quarter?\nRob Painter: The way I'd approach that is from a business model perspective the ARR was up 7% in the first quarter and certainly outperforming -- differentially performing against the rest of the portfolio. And so the businesses associated with that I think are the ones to highlight. So the construction related ARR that we have. The correction services business has performed a really outstanding performance in the quarter and where we see that business now as well. So those would be a couple of the spots I would point out in particular.\nDevin Au: Great. Thank you very much.\nRob Painter: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon and good evening everyone. I'm glad you're all doing well.\nRob Painter: Hi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Rob your comments about gross margin expansion really stood out to be considering what I would imagine would be pretty significant declines in perpetual license sales. Can you just expand what level of perpetual license sales declines you're seeing in April? And how you folks are able to essentially guide to improving gross margin in this environment that really stood out to me? Thanks.\nRob Painter: Well, if I took three revenue streams when we took the recurring revenue stream, we took the aggregate of software and perpetual software term software and professional services is the second category and then the third one being hardware. ARR is certainly the highest performer. And then in the -- I could reference you to the web tables that also break out the gross margin by these revenue types. And of course ARR is going to have the highest -- amongst the highest gross margins. And then if we look at -- and of course that grew in the quarter the ARR that was plus 7%. And on the other let's say book end would be the hardware businesses were at minus 8% year-over-year in the first quarter and are the lowest gross margin it's a category of revenue that we have. And then if we look at the perpetual software and the pro services that was down in the quarter and it'd be down, as well and therefore, extrapolate down in March, down in April as well. It's just not down as much as the hardware. So it's a kind of low single-digit range. And I'll just give you one more I guess nugget. Within that software category, we have about $80 million on a trailing 12-month basis of term license revenue that shows up as software not as a recurring revenue and that tranche within the software is growing nicely and is a profitable stream. So yes, you take the mix of that and you get the gross margin expansion which was clearly a major driver of the beat in the quarter on the EPS side.\nJerry Revich: And that's pretty resilient performance for the perpetual license business as well. Okay. And then in terms of the subscription offering so you spoke about accelerating the shift, can you just update us on the performance in terms of bookings growth in the transportation management system so far this year? And can you talk about relative to I think the $500 million target of subscription opportunity you have within the existing portfolio with integrator approach here? What's the cadence on translating that from perpetual license to recurring? Thanks.\nRob Painter: So if we look at the transportation management system, business or product line that we have, more than half bookings in the first quarter came as a subscription bookings. So really actually outperformed our own expectations we have as we do offer both subscription and perpetual offering. And of course, probably goes without saying that having that subscription offering becomes differentiably a good thing for customers in a tighter cash environment to move to an OpEx model. It also expands -- we believe expands an addressable market into the mid-size carriers through the conversion. If I look at the other businesses, I'll give you a couple of examples within -- actually within Buildings and Infrastructure. So we have a mechanical electrical plumbing business that's well over $100 million in revenue same thing with the steel and concrete structure business. Both of which we think we have significant opportunity to convert to subscription. And so in fact in our MEP business, we launched what's called Accubid Anywhere. That is a subscription offering and it's off to a decent start. Our structures business -- and I'd say a number of other businesses in Trimble that we have put in the category of -- we have some subscription elements of those businesses, but they are small elements of the business and we're really looking to accelerate and do the work I'd say the groundwork in 2020 to be able to really move quickly as we come in to next year. So not all of these actions I'm talking about will turn into increased ARR this year. But what I would want you to hear is that we think this is the time -- in this moment of crisis, this is the time to move faster on these conversions. And so we're shifting resources around shifting priorities around so that we can come to market faster with these offerings. We think it's the right thing to do for the long-term health of the business. And at a time of uncertainty like we have right now I think that cause for us to be decisive and this is one of those areas where we really are I think taking decisive action to move faster.\nJerry Revich: And Rob, sorry, just a clarification. So transportation management you had mentioned that half of new bookings are subscription, but when you combine them subscription and perpetual what was the year-over-year growth that you achieved as a result?\nRob Painter: No. So what I would say from an overall bookings perspective, if we just kind of step back and talk about software bookings or perpetual software bookings and let's separate January, February from kind of late March until now, the new bookings are off significantly at an aggregate level. And I would say, in fact, more than 50% down in these last few weeks. And that's quite consistent from what we hear in the market. So in the short-term the new bookings are really -- they really are taking a hit. Now you won't see that so much in the revenue today or in a Q2, Q3. It becomes -- this really becomes a factor of how long does this last? When we hit bottom, how long does that -- what's the nature of the slope out of it will determine how much of that plays into 2021. And so I do -- I should just note that that's what we see on the overall bookings level. And then if I was to get really specific about the transportation management system in the booking, we'll look at -- when we take a booking you want to make it equivalent to what a perpetual booking would be so that you understand the real underlying driver. So look at it on a multiyear basis so that you can equate it to the nature of what would have been a perpetual booking as you plan the business around that.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. This is Kristen [ph] on for Colin. Thank you for taking our question. Just a few operational questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your supply chain in Mexico on the hardware side just remind us how much third-party manufacturing exposure you have in that region? And what you're hearing from your suppliers as they remain under those stay-at-home orders?\nRob Painter: Yes. So I would say Kristen, we have -- I'd say a meaningful part of our contract manufacturing comes out of Mexico in fact much more so than China. Of course, components come from China, but the manufacturing has a substantial elements in Mexico. And the short answer is -- is that we've been up and running. In fact in some cases, we've gotten more capacity from the contract manufacturers as other companies have either shut down temporarily or they weren't essential businesses whatever factor it may be that in some cases actually enabled resources, I'd say labor resources to move to Trimble product which helped in businesses like agriculture, for example in the first quarter that exceeded the expectations. We have one operation in Guadalajara that's under a state-at-home order that really isn't running at this point, but we had enough I'd say heads up on that to build a little bit of inventory and it happens to be a business where the demand is also quite down. So it hasn't been an impact. But where it really matters we've been up and running.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And sort of speaking to the inventory point, I wanted to ask about your dealer channel and how much of that was under essential services? I think you mentioned some pre-buy activity ahead of those stay-at-home orders. So any commentary that you can provide on inventory build? Or what you're seeing in the dealer channel right now?\nRobert Painter: If anything, at this point in the quarter today, we would see really more of an inventory reduction or drawdown. I would say, there were certain parts of the channel in Q1 probably around the February time frame that were I think doing a little bit of buying ahead of the impending shutdowns. It's hard to discern exactly what the nature of the buy is. But we look at the levels of inventory right now, and we think that actually the dealers are being quite responsible overall. So it's really something we want to pay attention to, because it's in our interest that our dealers remain healthy and have liquidity. So we feel good about on an aggregate basis in all the businesses at the level of inventory that our dealers have. In terms of the essential nature of the businesses and how that impacts dealers, really for the most part on a global basis, our dealers have been up and running. I could go back to what Trimble does, feeding a growing population. It was planting season or it was and is planting season. In construction, we knew many of the projects were continuing to be at work and our customers were counting on us to be there as Trimble and also as our dealer partners. And same thing in transportation, you can imagine, the stress on transportation companies as they were moving essential goods and we needed to be there running for them. So, they've maintained being open for the most part. Of course, with the government had a complete shutdown with Italy as an example, we were also down during that time. And then -- but even on an interesting note in Italy, we were actually up on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter based on the strength of what that team brought into the beginning of the quarter and as well in the Geospatial business as well as the ongoing agriculture business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nJohn Weidemoyer: Hi. This is John Weidemoyer for Jonathan. Thanks for taking the question. I just have one. Can you talk about your level of optimism regarding the potential for infrastructure stimulus spend?\nRob Painter: Sure. So on infrastructure, I would say, we've got a mixed view. So let me take a global view first. If you look at the U.K., HS2 project got a notice to proceed. If you look at China, they've made some big infrastructure announcements. If we talk about the U.S., which I think is really what you're asking about. Well, what we know is our infrastructure is aging and that suggests that we're talking about when and not if something happens in infrastructure. So we are net optimistic that something will be happening on the funding side in the U.S. hopefully in the next package in the next relief package. But let's be clear that has not happened yet. I would note that many states in the last months or a couple of years have increased their own gas taxes. That enables them to take more control of their own destiny. But if we look at the flip side to be complete with the analysis, the FAST Act expires on September 30 and that needs to be either renewed or extended. If we look at state tax revenue that is greatly suffering and that would obviously benefit from some form of a federal backstop. And then we have the American Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019. And there we still have bipartisan disagreement on how to pay for it. So there are a set of, I would say, what I would call negative or cautious factors, the flip side being that infrastructure is such an obvious and important place for us to make investments here in the U.S. and a logical -- would be a logical part of a relief package. But of course, we haven't seen it yet.\nJohn Weidemoyer: Thank you. That\u2019s all. Appreciate it. That\u2019s it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, team. This is Eric [ph] on for James. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe just touching on a piece that may not be as topical, but understanding you're taking maybe a slower approach to acquisitions for now. But I'm wondering has the current environment sparked your interest in any new potential growth areas or opportunities you could look to be more active in the future?\nRob Painter: Well, the first place we've looked in the current environment is internally. And in that respect, really pivoting we want to pivot faster -- I'll say, faster harder to the subscription model. We've referenced a couple of the software businesses. But I neglected to mention the announcement we made at CONEXPO that launch what we call Trimble Platform as a Service to essentially to bundle. Our machine controlling guidance with our construction productivity software to connect the office and the field together and which we think is a unique offering. And that to us is really the first place we want to think about and look. And so the extent at which we're leveraging balance sheet or P&L, because let's do the math, the movement from perpetual to a subscription offering does have a short-term drag to a P&L into cash. That's the first place that we want to look to that. Secondarily, as the market moves, whether that's geographies or end-markets, we will pivot fast to what the market makes available or what it has available. And just maybe as a small example. But I think meaningful is I take an example like a trade show. Well in our agriculture business in Brazil, the team in the first quarter did a virtual trade show in Brazil that had over 3,000 people attended. Extraordinary ingenuity and creativity from the team and I would call that taking advantage of what's available and taking action around what's available to us in an environment. Now you asked then about externally in acquisitions. And with that pivot how we think. I would say there wouldn't be a fundamental pivot is the short answer.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just kind of sticking on some of the bundled subscriptions offerings, how are those being structured where there's kind of hardware and from like thinking through a replacement cycle side? Is there a cadence built into those offerings? And maybe like just how we should think about that?\nRob Painter: That's a good question. So if we took an example -- I'll give you an example on agriculture and an example on civil construction. And an agriculture example, that looks like bundling our guidance hardware with our office software or office and field software with our correction services. So you can get that centimetre level accuracy on the farm that a farmer needs. That to me is, less about accounting and technology replacement. That's really about reducing friction in the buying process. Instead of three separate transactions, it can happen as one transaction at the proverbial point of sale. If we take the civil construction example and the technology, our Trimble Platform as a Service offering, we announced at ConExpo, that does have a technology assurance aspect to it. And so there we could see a cadence. Let's take an example of a GPS receiver. If we have a new GPS or really GNSS receiver available, we can use that to upgrade the kit that the customer has on-site to provide them the latest functionality. So technology assurance is a really meaningful part of the strategy. The technology continues to get better every year, not only the sensors or the hardware but really the firmware and the software. And so for us it's important to be able to have a continued touch point to be able to update that. To be able to update firmware and display software you have to have connectivity to the machine. And we have that through the telematics product lines. We have that will also integrate into this offering. Now if we get forensically -- forensic on the accounting of it, the accounting has what's called an SSP, which really breaks out the value into its parts. And so the accounting will dictate what will show up, on the P&L.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to, Michael Leyba for closing remarks.\nMichael Leyba: Thank you everyone for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Good afternoon. COVID-19 is on the forefront of everyone's mind. Our presentation format will be different this quarter and is structured to address topics that seem to be top of mind amongst our long-term shareholders. As always our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Before we start walking through the slides, we want to acknowledge that this is an extremely challenging and uncertain time for all of us and that everyone listening has their own unique set of circumstances they are dealing with. While these calls are designed for our investors our employees are also active listeners. In fact over 40% of our employees are shareholders. As such these updates speak to both audiences. In our current environment, we lead with a moral principle to support the health and safety of our community including employees, customers, and dealer partners. We also lead with a strategic principle to keep our business moving forward.  We have customers and partners who rely on Trimble to keep their businesses running to move the goods of commerce, to feed the global population, to build and maintain our infrastructure, and more. With heartfelt gratitude and by the level of dedication and resolve from our over 11,500 Trimble colleagues, a worldwide network of dealer partners and our customers. As a leadership team, we activated a comprehensive global business continuity plan in early March. The vast majority of Trimble is working remotely and we are in the process of defining when and how we gradually return to our office environments. The ongoing economic impact to Trimble will correlate to when and how we and our customers establish a set of new normal working conditions. While it feels like we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, the fact remains that there is still a great deal of uncertainty. The essence of our planning has been to plan for the worst-case scenario and hope for the best. We took early and decisive action and I'm incredibly proud of how our team has rallied together as one Trimble. We will get through this crisis. We are well-positioned to endure the macroeconomic shock and we will emerge stronger on the other side of this. While we are managing the short-term realities, we are also equally focused on executing our long-term strategy. Let's shift to the presentation. Slide two has the seven key messages we want to address today. As I've just highlighted our team has risen to the challenge and this is point one. Point two, our first quarter results exceeded expectations demonstrating the quality of the Trimble strategy and the financial strength in the first 11 weeks of the quarter, A big thank you to the Trimble team. Point three our balance sheet and access to liquidity remain emphatically strong. Point four, as we look to the past to inform the actions of today, the multi-year execution of our strategy and the transformation of our business model has established more resiliency than at any point in our history. Point five; we took early and decisive management actions including increasing liquidity and implementing broad-based temporary pay reductions to fortify the business. My commitment to our Trimble team is to restore pay as soon as possible. Point six, we are suspending guidance and we will be as transparent as we can with the puts and takes we are seeing in the market and in our business. Point seven, the cumulative actions we have taken enable us to stay true to our long-term strategy Connect & Scale 2025. No changes. Moving to slide three, the message here is that our business is essential and our team is leading. My opening comments addressed much of what is on this slide. Before I turn it over to David, slide four offers a few examples of how Trimble is helping our customers and communities during this time. In our transportation business our team is offering a free service to display and collect current truck stop status and amenity information. We are also offering free driver trip planning to suggest open truck stops and rest areas. Our leasing team has put together programs that are enabling customers to extend payment terms. In our communities I'd like to highlight our Cityworks team which is offering a web-based GIS-centric platform for local governments to manage their emergency response efforts. David? Let's move to slide 10. While we are suspending our second quarter and total year guidance, we also want to be transparent and talk about the areas where we have more and less visibility. David described a number of ways in which our business was impacted in March as the economic slowdown took hold. I'll expand on those comments and give you some thoughts on how we see our business trending in the second quarter. The overall performance of the quarter will correlate to the opening up of global economies and the return of more normalized demand patterns. The areas of the business model where we have the most visibility and confidence includes ARR, gross margins, and operating expenses. ARR represents approximately one-third of our total revenue. In the second quarter, we expect this to be up in the low single-digit range on a year-over-year basis. We'd also expect to see modest gross margin expansion as our revenue is increasingly weighted towards software-centric revenue. Relative to operating expenses, David covered the cost containment actions we took. In our non-recurring revenue businesses, new hardware demand and new logo software bookings growth has been depressed during the shelter-in-place time. We are digitally engaging with prospective customers and building our pipeline, but the fact remains that the rate of deal closure levels are below what we experienced at the beginning of the year. Looking at our reporting segments and taking a view of the puts and takes in the end markets, we have a point of view on the relative performance we expect across the segments. On a year-over-year basis, we expect revenue in all reporting segments to be down in the second quarter. We expect resources and utilities to outperform amongst the segments driven by our correction services and utilities businesses. On the other side, we expect Geospatial to underperform amongst the segments given the hardware centricity of the reporting segment. Turning to our last slide. I want to step back for a moment and revisit two of the three first principles we established upfront during the crisis. We said, we would protect and strengthen the core of Trimble and position ourselves to exit the crisis in a stronger competitive position. The underlying investment thesis of Trimble is stronger than ever. That is the digitization of end markets that are historically underserved and underpenetrated with technology that delivers productivity, quality, safety, visibility and environmental sustainability to our customers. With that backdrop, our long-term shareholders expect us to deliver long-term sustainable value. We believe we have taken the responsible short-term actions to confidently weather the crisis, which allows us to stay focused on our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy, which we believe is more relevant than ever. The takeaway here is that we will play offense on core elements of our strategy, in particular the transition to subscription revenue models across our business. We will also continue to invest in business processes and systems to accelerate the strategic transformation. As evidenced, we are pulling forward some of our transitions into 2020 and 2021. For example, we launched our transportation management system as a subscription offering and we now see more than half of our new bookings being subscriptions instead of perpetual license offerings. As another important example at CONEXPO in February, we announced what we are calling Trimble Platform as a Service that bundles our machine control and guidance kit along with Trimble productivity software into a subscription offering. Customers will benefit from technology assurance and a platform that can be feature upgraded. They also benefit by converting to an OpEx model and being able to more easily charge machine time to specific projects. We further connect this job cost information with our viewpoint construction ERP system and our works OS platform that bring together data elements from other Trimble and non-Trimble technology into a single tool to remotely manage productivity and uptime of the site. In our agriculture business, we are now offering bundles of our guidance hardware along with our software and correction services. The aim is to make ourselves easier to do business with and to reduce friction in the buying process. Next our strategy guides us to further connect our industry life cycles. As evidence of our progress in the construction market, we expect Trimble Connect to reach 10 million users in the second quarter and we currently have over 80,000 active multiuser projects being managed in Connect. This user base provides us a platform to deepen our customer engagement over time and more importantly than ever provides an environment for them to continue to collaborate on projects from anywhere. Finally, we have not pulled back our R&D efforts and we will continue our 40-plus year history of innovation. Two examples I want to share here. First at CONEXPO, we announced our Earthworks 2.0 system that enables extensibility of the base platform. For example, we launched automated horizontal steering capabilities, which advances our progress on the path to autonomy. Using this platform, we demonstrated remote control capabilities and operated a set of equipment in Dayton, Ohio from the show floor in Las Vegas. Second, in our correction services business, the team achieved a great milestone in the quarter, completing a multiyear effort, deploying our RTX Fast technology across the contiguous U.S. parts of Southern Canada and much of Western Europe. We now cover nearly five million square miles with RTX Fast capability, which allows users to realize one centimeter accuracy in less than one minute via Internet or satellite broadcast. RTX Fast is ideally suited for autonomous on-road and off-road applications. To conclude, I would like to thank everyone for your time and your support and a special thank you to our global Trimble colleagues. Operator, let's please go to Q&A. So yes, there was a few factors that contributed to the outperform in the quarter, which includes some of the following. So it wasn't early planting season overall, which we think helped the business to some degree. To the credit of the team the new product introductions that have come out in the last month seem to be doing well in the market and we think that that contributed. The other part that's in Resources and Utilities as a reporting segment is our correction services business, as well as a set of utility and local government businesses we have. Our correction services business had a very strong first quarter which we believe also correlated not only to the health of the business but the early planting season. And then our utilities business has been coming along nicely and the Cityworks acquisition that we completed a few months ago is off to a nice start. So a number of factors came together in the reporting segment to set up a next quarter. Yes that's a good point, Ann and that would be correct. Well, there's certainly less visibility into the hardware business than the recurring revenue, software we have in the reporting segment. If I take it from an angle of sentiment from customers, I would say we're hearing mixed reports from customers so far. On the positive side, we came in -- as we came into the first quarter, our customers had backlog and the sentiment was strong. And then as the virus took hold, projects clearly slowed down or halted and that was a negative at the end of the quarter. So here in the next few, I'll say weeks or months, as our customers get back to work, we expect, I'd say the hardware side of the business to proverbially come back to work as well. And now what I would say is we also hear some concern about work coming into looking forward into 2021. And then we also hear shift in sentiment as you would expect around some of the end market work. So something like commercial work or energy-related work will be difficult work such as hospitals or data centers would be good. So the mix of work is we expect to change as well. That's pretty close. I'd say, I mean in the software businesses, overall the work we do is of essential nature. It's an ERP system you're either in business or you're not in -- the technology continues to be fundamental to the business and used. The -- then there is the next category I would take the construction equipment, let's say the contractors and then the third would be the OEM. So OEM-related revenue that we have I would put at the bottom of the list in the rank order. Well, the apps themselves are available to any company. So we didn't make a distinction of a customer not a customer. Now you'll probably get more value out of it if you are an existing customer and you're integrating into the bigger workflow. So I suspect there is a degree of let's say visibility or reach to potentially new customers but I should say it wasn't initiated as a marketing effort... That's a good question, Rob. Certainly, the trucking market and well I say North America is certainly challenged at the moment and we see that the same data that you do whether it's the new Class eight units or now inventory levels or spot market rates. So it is a tough macro setup here in the near -- I'll say near to midterm for trucking companies. And David covered looking back at Q1, there were actually also some quite bright spots. And -- but looking forward, yes, I would say the macro is more negative at this point. Now when we think about the defensibility of the business, we actually also think this becomes a strength for Trimble. And so far, as we've got the value proposition and we've got the balance sheet to continue to be able to invest in this business, we've seen a couple of competitive companies either go out of the market or significantly cut back in the last couple of weeks. So from a competitive position, we'll continue to play offense in this business. We think we've got a winning strategy and we believe in the team that we have that's pursuing the strategy. So, we won't back off of let's say the pursuit of the business strategy. And we're confident that as we come out of this that we'll come out of it stronger. And that's really a major part of the orientation, we have as we really came into this is make sure that we position ourselves to exit the crisis on a stronger competitive footing than how we entered it. Okay. So, if we think about the businesses sequentially in the second quarter, the short answer is, it wouldn't change my answer. I mean historically, you would expect to see construction especially civil construction coming on stronger in the second quarter given the summer season for construction. But we don't see that happening this in the second quarter. Otherwise, if you took a market let's say Resources and Utilities which is ag-centric, you would expect to see that seasonally decline in the second quarter if I use that as a sort of a contra example. Well we stay in close contact not only with our dealer partners around the world, but our end customers and prospects and the pipeline that we have in the various businesses. If we look at a market let's say, if we take Asia, we can start to see business coming back in parts of Asia. So, if we take a market like China, now China is a small portion of Trimble these days less than 2% of revenue. But we have started to see business come back. If we look in the Nordics, we can start to see some of the business coming back as well. And so there's a bit of a geographic overlay to that Rick that informs the point of view that we feel like we're seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. As we look in North America and the governments are local -- and I'll say local governments are starting to talk about return to work or lifting some of the restrictions that it certainly plays into some of our psychology of seeing people getting back to work. They can be on the other end of that phone call for the demand side of this equation. Well the markets that we see coming back to some degree are in some of the Asian markets I'll use China as an example and in the Nordics in Europe where the couple of examples I pointed out that would be current time. If I look at Q1 itself, I can use Brazil as an example, where we had a strong quarter in Brazil both in the agriculture business but even more so in our transportation business in Brazil. And so there's pockets of performance around I'd say around the globe. I think you asked something -- I did miss the first part of the question around utilities can you repeat that? The way I'd approach that is from a business model perspective the ARR was up 7% in the first quarter and certainly outperforming -- differentially performing against the rest of the portfolio. And so the businesses associated with that I think are the ones to highlight. So the construction related ARR that we have. The correction services business has performed a really outstanding performance in the quarter and where we see that business now as well. So those would be a couple of the spots I would point out in particular. You're welcome. Hi, Jerry. Well, if I took three revenue streams when we took the recurring revenue stream, we took the aggregate of software and perpetual software term software and professional services is the second category and then the third one being hardware. ARR is certainly the highest performer. And then in the -- I could reference you to the web tables that also break out the gross margin by these revenue types. And of course ARR is going to have the highest -- amongst the highest gross margins. And then if we look at -- and of course that grew in the quarter the ARR that was plus 7%. And on the other let's say book end would be the hardware businesses were at minus 8% year-over-year in the first quarter and are the lowest gross margin it's a category of revenue that we have. And then if we look at the perpetual software and the pro services that was down in the quarter and it'd be down, as well and therefore, extrapolate down in March, down in April as well. It's just not down as much as the hardware. So it's a kind of low single-digit range. And I'll just give you one more I guess nugget. Within that software category, we have about $80 million on a trailing 12-month basis of term license revenue that shows up as software not as a recurring revenue and that tranche within the software is growing nicely and is a profitable stream. So yes, you take the mix of that and you get the gross margin expansion which was clearly a major driver of the beat in the quarter on the EPS side. So if we look at the transportation management system, business or product line that we have, more than half bookings in the first quarter came as a subscription bookings. So really actually outperformed our own expectations we have as we do offer both subscription and perpetual offering. And of course, probably goes without saying that having that subscription offering becomes differentiably a good thing for customers in a tighter cash environment to move to an OpEx model. It also expands -- we believe expands an addressable market into the mid-size carriers through the conversion. If I look at the other businesses, I'll give you a couple of examples within -- actually within Buildings and Infrastructure. So we have a mechanical electrical plumbing business that's well over $100 million in revenue same thing with the steel and concrete structure business. Both of which we think we have significant opportunity to convert to subscription. And so in fact in our MEP business, we launched what's called Accubid Anywhere. That is a subscription offering and it's off to a decent start. Our structures business -- and I'd say a number of other businesses in Trimble that we have put in the category of -- we have some subscription elements of those businesses, but they are small elements of the business and we're really looking to accelerate and do the work I'd say the groundwork in 2020 to be able to really move quickly as we come in to next year. So not all of these actions I'm talking about will turn into increased ARR this year. But what I would want you to hear is that we think this is the time -- in this moment of crisis, this is the time to move faster on these conversions. And so we're shifting resources around shifting priorities around so that we can come to market faster with these offerings. We think it's the right thing to do for the long-term health of the business. And at a time of uncertainty like we have right now I think that cause for us to be decisive and this is one of those areas where we really are I think taking decisive action to move faster. No. So what I would say from an overall bookings perspective, if we just kind of step back and talk about software bookings or perpetual software bookings and let's separate January, February from kind of late March until now, the new bookings are off significantly at an aggregate level. And I would say, in fact, more than 50% down in these last few weeks. And that's quite consistent from what we hear in the market. So in the short-term the new bookings are really -- they really are taking a hit. Now you won't see that so much in the revenue today or in a Q2, Q3. It becomes -- this really becomes a factor of how long does this last? When we hit bottom, how long does that -- what's the nature of the slope out of it will determine how much of that plays into 2021. And so I do -- I should just note that that's what we see on the overall bookings level. And then if I was to get really specific about the transportation management system in the booking, we'll look at -- when we take a booking you want to make it equivalent to what a perpetual booking would be so that you understand the real underlying driver. So look at it on a multiyear basis so that you can equate it to the nature of what would have been a perpetual booking as you plan the business around that. Yes. So I would say Kristen, we have -- I'd say a meaningful part of our contract manufacturing comes out of Mexico in fact much more so than China. Of course, components come from China, but the manufacturing has a substantial elements in Mexico. And the short answer is -- is that we've been up and running. In fact in some cases, we've gotten more capacity from the contract manufacturers as other companies have either shut down temporarily or they weren't essential businesses whatever factor it may be that in some cases actually enabled resources, I'd say labor resources to move to Trimble product which helped in businesses like agriculture, for example in the first quarter that exceeded the expectations. We have one operation in Guadalajara that's under a state-at-home order that really isn't running at this point, but we had enough I'd say heads up on that to build a little bit of inventory and it happens to be a business where the demand is also quite down. So it hasn't been an impact. But where it really matters we've been up and running. Sure. So on infrastructure, I would say, we've got a mixed view. So let me take a global view first. If you look at the U.K., HS2 project got a notice to proceed. If you look at China, they've made some big infrastructure announcements. If we talk about the U.S., which I think is really what you're asking about. Well, what we know is our infrastructure is aging and that suggests that we're talking about when and not if something happens in infrastructure. So we are net optimistic that something will be happening on the funding side in the U.S. hopefully in the next package in the next relief package. But let's be clear that has not happened yet. I would note that many states in the last months or a couple of years have increased their own gas taxes. That enables them to take more control of their own destiny. But if we look at the flip side to be complete with the analysis, the FAST Act expires on September 30 and that needs to be either renewed or extended. If we look at state tax revenue that is greatly suffering and that would obviously benefit from some form of a federal backstop. And then we have the American Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019. And there we still have bipartisan disagreement on how to pay for it. So there are a set of, I would say, what I would call negative or cautious factors, the flip side being that infrastructure is such an obvious and important place for us to make investments here in the U.S. and a logical -- would be a logical part of a relief package. But of course, we haven't seen it yet. Well, the first place we've looked in the current environment is internally. And in that respect, really pivoting we want to pivot faster -- I'll say, faster harder to the subscription model. We've referenced a couple of the software businesses. But I neglected to mention the announcement we made at CONEXPO that launch what we call Trimble Platform as a Service to essentially to bundle. Our machine controlling guidance with our construction productivity software to connect the office and the field together and which we think is a unique offering. And that to us is really the first place we want to think about and look. And so the extent at which we're leveraging balance sheet or P&L, because let's do the math, the movement from perpetual to a subscription offering does have a short-term drag to a P&L into cash. That's the first place that we want to look to that. Secondarily, as the market moves, whether that's geographies or end-markets, we will pivot fast to what the market makes available or what it has available. And just maybe as a small example. But I think meaningful is I take an example like a trade show. Well in our agriculture business in Brazil, the team in the first quarter did a virtual trade show in Brazil that had over 3,000 people attended. Extraordinary ingenuity and creativity from the team and I would call that taking advantage of what's available and taking action around what's available to us in an environment. Now you asked then about externally in acquisitions. And with that pivot how we think. I would say there wouldn't be a fundamental pivot is the short answer. That's a good question. So if we took an example -- I'll give you an example on agriculture and an example on civil construction. And an agriculture example, that looks like bundling our guidance hardware with our office software or office and field software with our correction services. So you can get that centimetre level accuracy on the farm that a farmer needs. That to me is, less about accounting and technology replacement. That's really about reducing friction in the buying process. Instead of three separate transactions, it can happen as one transaction at the proverbial point of sale. If we take the civil construction example and the technology, our Trimble Platform as a Service offering, we announced at ConExpo, that does have a technology assurance aspect to it. And so there we could see a cadence. Let's take an example of a GPS receiver. If we have a new GPS or really GNSS receiver available, we can use that to upgrade the kit that the customer has on-site to provide them the latest functionality. So technology assurance is a really meaningful part of the strategy. The technology continues to get better every year, not only the sensors or the hardware but really the firmware and the software. And so for us it's important to be able to have a continued touch point to be able to update that. To be able to update firmware and display software you have to have connectivity to the machine. And we have that through the telematics product lines. We have that will also integrate into this offering. Now if we get forensically -- forensic on the accounting of it, the accounting has what's called an SSP, which really breaks out the value into its parts. And so the accounting will dictate what will show up, on the P&L."

            "content": "Thanks Rob. Turning to slide five, non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter was $794 million in the middle of our guidance range despite greater-than-anticipated weakness in demand late in the quarter as the pandemic impact widened. I'll note that Q1 revenue reflects outstanding management of the supply chain disruption coming out of China. We exceeded our initial expectations in fulfillment of customer demand despite the fact that the shutdowns in China were more severe and longer-lasting than we anticipated when we issued guidance in mid-February. Total revenue growth for the quarter was minus 1% which included minus 2% from organic growth and approximately minus 1% from changes in exchange rates as the U.S. dollar strengthened during the quarter. Acquisitions added about 2% to revenue during the quarter. Our recurring revenue was strong with annualized recurring revenue or ARR up 7% year-on-year and up 6% on an organic basis. Note that this represents about a 1% acceleration from ARR performance in Q4 of 2019. Gross margins, operating margins, net income and EPS improved versus prior year and EPS came in well above our guidance range. Margins improved during the quarter for a number of reasons. Gross margins were higher year-on-year driven principally by an improvement in mix, as our higher margin software businesses performed relatively well during the quarter. Lower levels of discounting and the introduction of higher end new hardware products also improved margins. As the impending weakness in the economy became apparent, we pulled back on discretionary spending, including travel and outside services and we reduced our rate of hiring. In addition, our expense relating to incentive and commission plans was reduced meaningfully during the quarter. Note that the temporary pay reductions Rob mentioned in his remarks did not take effect until the last week of Q1, so we will see the vast majority of that cost benefit beginning in Q2. Turning to slide six. We are showing here revenue and profit trends by segment, and I'll touch on the factors, which are expected to drive the sector businesses going forward. The Resources and Utilities segment had a strong revenue and profit quarter driven by demand in the agricultural sector for aftermarket products and correction services. Late in the quarter our OEM business was impacted by factory shutdowns, but end customer demand proved to be solidly resilient through the quarter. Revenue trends were aided late in the quarter by customers buying product in anticipation of shutdowns in distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our Buildings and Infrastructure segment had organic growth in the quarter driven by our civil business and growth in our recurring revenue offerings. The organic growth occurred despite March weakness in project starts and bookings. With some notable exceptions most ongoing construction project activity continued despite COVID-19-related work restrictions. The Geospatial business got off to a strong start in the quarter driven by new products and by the timing of dealer orders. March results were much weaker both because dealers drew down inventories and because demand began to weaken with the decline in oil prices and the implementation of shelter-in-place rules. Transportation revenue was weak in the quarter, driven in part by the factors we discussed in our Q4 2019 release. As you will recall, we have experienced challenges related to the implementation of the ELD mandate in our telematics business. Revenue trends weakened further in March as the COVID-19 crisis took hold. During the quarter we made significant progress in addressing product functionality gaps and partly as a result, we are seeing lower churn coming out of the quarter. Going forward we plan to accelerate the transformation to higher-performing hardware across our customers' fleets. While these steps will put continued pressure on margins this year, we believe they will position the business for stability later this year in growth as the market returns to more normal conditions. The transportation market in Q1 was a meaningful turmoil relating to the pandemic. Providers to food retailers saw a significant spike in demand, while trucking companies supporting capital goods or energy markets experienced a significant reduction in freight demand. Overall, our business was impacted in March by a deterioration in market conditions and a decline in the number of trucks on the road. I'll note here that our maps business, which has a recurring revenue model saw strong demand through the quarter. One additional observation about the timing of revenue trends within Q1, revenue growth was strong through the first two months of the quarter and then weakened in March as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. Revenue growth was in the high single-digits through the first two months of the quarter and then was down in the mid-teens in March. I'd also like to comment briefly on the trends we have seen in our business after the full COVID-19 crisis hit in March. I'll start with our recurring revenue, which remains strong even in this period of facility shutdowns and economic weakness. Customer retention so far is in line with our pre-crisis experience. Our enterprise systems are critical for our clients' operations. Approximately 75% of our recurring revenue offerings represent field or enterprise software used day in and day out in the course of our customers' businesses. So as long as our customers remain in business and project activity continues then our products are essential. In fact usage of many of our systems has grown since the crisis intensified. We are however seeing a delay in bookings of recurring software as customers rethink their priorities and cope with facility shutdowns, but this will have only a small impact on our revenue in 2020 and we are holding our share of the new awards that are coming through. Our non-recurring revenue businesses are unsurprisingly experiencing more adverse trends since the COVID-19 crisis expanded in March. Our OEM hardware business, which collectively makes up less than 15% of revenue have been significantly impacted by the shutdown of many of our customers' production facilities. Hardware sales have been adversely hampered by work restrictions at our dealers and at their customers, while much of our professional service business has been impacted by the lack of access to our clients' people and facilities. Encouragingly, we entered Q2 with over $1.2 billion of backlog. Of this amount roughly $250 million is from our non-recurring revenue businesses up versus the same period last year. We expect the majority of that backlog to convert to revenue this year. Turning now to slide seven. Our cash flow balance sheet and access to liquidity remains strong. During Q1, we generated $156 million of cash flow from operations, up 5% from the prior year. We ended the quarter with $217 million of cash. We have renegotiated terms of an outstanding term loan to extend the maturity from July of 2021 to July of 2022. As you can see from the table, we anticipate no principal due on any of our outstanding debt for the next two years. We also have over $1 billion of untapped borrowing capacity on our credit facility. Our outstanding debt is rated investment-grade by both Moody's and S&P with stable outlooks from both agencies. Moody's just reaffirmed their rating and stable outlook in a report issued last week. We finished Q1 with financial ratios comfortably in compliance with our credit line covenants. We have a strong primary focus on ensuring credit facility compliance and access to liquidity as we model potential scenarios for our business in the coming quarters. Our business generates significant cash flow, consistently in excess of earnings even in times of economic downturn. Our financial modeling shows that the business would continue to generate significant free cash flow even in environment of revenue reduction significantly worse than what we saw in the global financial crisis. In summary, our balance sheet is strong and we have taken action to further strengthen our capital structure as the COVID-19 crisis has unfolded. The current capital structure and the demonstrated ability of our business model to generate cash even under adverse scenarios gives us the platform to weather the crisis and to continue to execute our strategy. Turning now to slide eight. I'd like to point your attention to several ways in which our business model has evolved since the beginning of the last two phases of real weaknesses in our end markets, the global financial crisis at the end of 2008 and the commodity price declines of several years ago. Note that in 2008, hardware represented nearly 90% of Trimble revenues, and that the Geospatial segment made up just under half of our business. This revenue mix left us highly vulnerable to reductions in capital spend in a number of markets, especially oil and gas. With this business mix Trimble revenue declined 15% in 2009. In the last 12 years, our model has evolved significantly with hardware now making up less than half of our revenue and our sector and geographic diversification leaves us better able to withstand any focused reduction in capital spending activity. As I noted earlier, the one-third of our business with the recurring revenue model is holding up well through the first months of the COVID-19 crisis. The point here is that our business model is more resilient than ever with a more diversified and stable revenue mix. Turning now to slide nine. I'll talk about efforts we have undertaken across a number of areas to fortify our business for the recession we now see coming. From a capital allocation perspective, we've taken a number of steps to ensure that our balance sheet remains strong. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program and put a hold on significant new acquisitions until we can see clear signs of recovery in our business and end markets. As I noted earlier, we have negotiated an extension on the scheduled maturity of an existing term loan. From a cost perspective, we have taken action on a number of fronts. These actions include an immediate reduction in discretionary spend like travel, lower forecasted payouts on our incentive plans, the elimination of our planned annual salary increase, and a broad-based temporary salary reduction program. The salary reduction program, which took effect just as Q1 ended reduces our payroll base of $200 million per quarter by approximately 10%. Note that, the reductions were implemented in a progressive approach. Many of our frontline workers receive no reduction at all while our CEO, Board of Directors and senior leadership team have accepted temporary reductions of 50%. Of the $20 million per quarter salary savings approximately 75% or $15 million per quarter will show up in operating expense with the remainder in cost of goods sold. The salary savings when combined with our other cost reduction initiatives have reduced our quarterly run rate of operating expenses by roughly $30 million per quarter lower than the first quarter 2020 run rate and $50 million per quarter when compared with our pre-COVID 2020 plan. From a supply chain perspective, we plan to keep doing what worked well for us in Q1 as we managed the disruptions in China. Our team has shown an ability to be creative and flexible in responding to whatever disruptions we see in the market and we will constantly readjust our plans to ensure that we meet evolving customer demand. Now, I will turn it back over to Rob to talk about our views looking forward. Hi Rick, it's David Barnes. Yes the $250 million is the backlog of our leading up the recurring business. And the point I made is that amount is higher than it was a year ago. And now we haven't seen any meaningful cancellations yet. There are as you inferred some delays but nothing in our backlog is being canceled of any consequence."

            "name": "Robert Painter",
            "content": "If anything, at this point in the quarter today, we would see really more of an inventory reduction or drawdown. I would say, there were certain parts of the channel in Q1 probably around the February time frame that were I think doing a little bit of buying ahead of the impending shutdowns. It's hard to discern exactly what the nature of the buy is. But we look at the levels of inventory right now, and we think that actually the dealers are being quite responsible overall. So it's really something we want to pay attention to, because it's in our interest that our dealers remain healthy and have liquidity. So we feel good about on an aggregate basis in all the businesses at the level of inventory that our dealers have. In terms of the essential nature of the businesses and how that impacts dealers, really for the most part on a global basis, our dealers have been up and running. I could go back to what Trimble does, feeding a growing population. It was planting season or it was and is planting season. In construction, we knew many of the projects were continuing to be at work and our customers were counting on us to be there as Trimble and also as our dealer partners. And same thing in transportation, you can imagine, the stress on transportation companies as they were moving essential goods and we needed to be there running for them. So, they've maintained being open for the most part. Of course, with the government had a complete shutdown with Italy as an example, we were also down during that time. And then -- but even on an interesting note in Italy, we were actually up on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter based on the strength of what that team brought into the beginning of the quarter and as well in the Geospatial business as well as the ongoing agriculture business."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Trimble Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Results. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer of Trimble. Thank you. Please go ahead sir. \nRob Painter: Welcome everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Let's begin on Page 2 with the following key messages. Our team once again delivered outstanding results and did so amidst ongoing supply chain difficulties, delivering total organic revenue growth of 14% and organic ARR growth of 12% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year at a record level of ARR of $1.41 billion, and 2021 EBITDA margin of 25.6%, and operating cash flow of $751 million. Reflecting on our 2021 results in comparison to our May 2018 Investor Day plan, I am proud to say our team made a great deal of progress. In May 2018, we targeted 2021 adjusted EBITDA between 23% to 24% of revenue. We closed 2021 at 25.6% EBITDA. We targeted software services and recurring revenue mix at 55% of total revenue. We closed 2021 at 55%. We targeted the ratio of 2021 operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income at approximately 1.1 times, and we closed 2021 at 1.11 times. In July 2018, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood above three times and we said we would delever below 2.5 times. Today we stand at 1.0 times. These proof points give us conviction that we are on the right strategic path with Connect & Scale 2025 that we can uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds, to deliver value to our customers, and that our asset-light business model works for our shareholders. Looking at current market conditions, the overall demand landscape remains robust and we enter the year with record hardware backlog and record ARR. Nevertheless, we are paying close attention to three obvious market factors: interest rates, supply chain and labor market dynamics. While the overall landscape presents material short to mid-term planning challenges, what is straightforward is that the global infrastructure spend is a positive catalyst for the long-term health of the business and that in difficult economic environment our value proposition that delivers productivity and sustainability will remain a secular growth catalyst. Moving to page 3. I'll talk about the progression of our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy, as seen through the lens of the Trimble Operating System capturing strategy, people and execution. Starting with strategy. I'll provide three proof points of our progress in the quarter. First, we acquired AgileAssets, which provides SaaS solutions with analytical tools to manage roads, bridges, airports and rail assets, so customers can better plan, operate and report on those assets across the life cycle. The addition of AgileAssets to Trimble's platform will add the as-maintained model to our as-designed and as-built data. Availability of this data within the model creates a robust digital twin for owners throughout the asset life cycle, thereby providing greater predictability, sustainability and lower lifetime asset costs. Second, we have increased our ambitions in the area of sustainability both internally with our own carbon footprint and externally through the commercialization of sustainability. We have submitted our science-based targets for review, and we plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement. In addition, our most recent score from the climate disclosure project went up again, marking two increases since we first submitted in 2018, and we continue to work diligently to further improve our score. With an external lens, customers are increasingly asking us to help them think about, manage and verify carbon reductions from the productivity and efficiency gains delivered through the use of our products. We have stepped up our ambition level to meet this market opportunity. Third, we have continued to transform our software and hardware business model offerings, which has translated into increased bookings and ARR, which in turn gives us visibility into continued growth in 2022. Our Connect & Scale strategy is a platform strategy, and we are executing that strategy in part by partnering to build ecosystems. As evidence, we have a new Microsoft partnership that will first focus on construction, and we established Trimble Ventures in the third quarter and made our first ventures investment in the fourth quarter. Moving to people in our operating system, I start by reflecting on our purpose in the world. We are transforming and digitizing industries that support how we live, what we eat and how we move. In a competitive labor environment, we continue to see people attracted to the why of Trimble. We won a couple of Global Culture Survey awards in the fourth quarter both for overall company culture and for diversity. We made demonstrable progress in our DEI journey in 2021 and our team continues to engage in their local and global communities through company-sponsored days of service and through our Trimble Foundation. We believe the intersection of a great workplace environment and a purpose-driven organization provides a solid foundation upon which to lead, grow and compete for talent. We were also able to recruit Ann Fandozzi to our Board in 2021. And in January, we announced the addition of Tom Sweet, Dell's CFO to our Board. I'm encouraged by individuals of this global caliber enthusiastically joining our Board and contributing to our ongoing growth. Moving to execution in the Trimble Operating System, we saw the benefits of ongoing innovation throughout the course of 2021. In the fourth quarter, we reached a milestone of one million monthly active users of Trimble Connect. With our digital transformation efforts making progress, we now have all of these users on common identity and entitlement stacks. We launched the new trimble.com web presence in December, the culmination of a couple of years' worth of work to modernize this important vehicle. We've also stepped up our outbound efforts to tell our story and to reach important new audiences. We look forward to hosting some in-person events in 2022 and such as our Transportation User Conference in August and our Dimensions User Conference for engineering and construction in November. Finally, we see our fundamental responsibility to shareholders as being capital allocators, balancing short-term realities with long-term possibility. To this end, we divested three businesses in 2021 on top of the four divestitures in 2020. In 2022, we will disproportionately invest in areas of the company such as the infrastructure opportunity, autonomy and our own digital transformation. We make these investments and are accelerating the transition to recurring revenue models of a number of our software businesses in the context of a challenging supply chain environment, which is constraining our ability to meet customer demand and adding inflationary pressures. The steps we are taking will moderate our operating leverage over the next few quarters but will move us forward in our ability to reach the full potential of our strategy. Before I turn it over to David, a big shout out to all 11,500 plus Trimble team members for your ongoing dedication and execution to our global dealer partners and to our strategic partners for their efforts, and to all of you in the investment community who trust us with your capital. David, over to you.\nDavid Barnes: Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue was $926 million, up 12% versus a year ago. Organic revenue growth was 14%. Our strong revenue in the quarter was enabled by the outstanding performance of our supply chain and operations team as hardware revenue grew by over 20% versus the fourth quarter of last year, notwithstanding the extraordinarily difficult supply chain environment. Backlog of unfilled hardware orders grew in the quarter, reflecting both the strong demand in our end markets and customers placing orders earlier than they would have in the past. Hardware backlog at the end of fourth quarter was nearly four times the level of a year ago before the supply chain challenges emerged. With this strong backlog, we have unprecedented visibility into demand for our hardware offerings going into 2022. ARR grew at an organic rate of 12% driven by business model conversions, strong bookings and healthy customer retention for recurring solutions in the quarter. Gross margins were 57.8%, down 90 basis points sequentially from third quarter levels and down 160 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020. Gross margins were impacted by the mix of hardware revenue, higher inbound freight costs and our aggressive purchases of components in the broker market to support strong demand. Cost inflation was higher than our expectations and the price increases we took in our hardware offerings did not fully offset an unexpectedly sharp spike in cost inflation in the quarter. The price increases we have taken so far this year, averaging approximately 5% at the list price level across most of our hardware businesses and accompanied by reduced discounting have been accepted in the market. Given our leading position in the markets we serve, we are confident in our ability to maintain attractive margins. And we continue to adopt our pricing strategy to the cost outlook. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 24.1%, while operating income margins were 22.1%. As we expected, margins in the quarter were lower than the fourth quarter of 2020, but higher than Q4 of 2019. EPS was $0.62. We generated cash flow from operations of $155 million and free cash flow of over $140 million. Cash flow was lower than Q4 of 2020, driven by increased component inventory purchases. Turning now to slide 5, let's step back and review performance for the full year 2021. In the face of unprecedented challenges coming from the ongoing COVID disruptions supply chain shortages and accelerating inflation we achieved record results across a broad range of financial metrics. Revenue grew 16% to a record $3.66 billion and the ARR growth improved sequentially. While gross margins were down modestly, due to both inflation and the higher growth of our hardware revenues, EBITDA and operating margins ended the year above the levels of 2020 and at record levels in Trimble's history. Earnings per share were $2.66 up 19% versus a year ago. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow grew 12% and 14% respectively. Now on slide 6, from a geographic perspective revenues were up in all regions with the highest growth rate in Europe. North America revenue in the quarter also grew at a double-digit rate. Turning now to other key operating metrics on slide 7, I'll note that backlog ended the year at $1.8 billion. This is up from $1.3 billion a year ago. While backlog and our recurring offerings continued to grow, the majority of this increase came from hardware. And year-end hardware backlog exceeded our expectations of a quarter ago. Our results for 2021 reflect the achievement of a meaningful milestone. On a trailing 12-month basis our software services and recurring revenue exceeded $2 billion for the first time. Operating cash flow of over $750 million was also a record and exceeded 1.1 times non-GAAP net income. Turning now to our results by segment on slide 8, revenue was at or above our expectations in all segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue grew 14% versus prior year and 16% organically. Growth was strong across both hardware and software. Our sales of machine control solutions to civil construction customers grew by nearly 30% this quarter, despite supply chain constraints. ARR growth in the segment was strong with Viewpoint and e-Builder ARR together up at a mid-teens growth rate. SketchUp ARR growth was nearly 40%, while ARR gained momentum in our structures and MEP software businesses as they accelerated their transitions to recurring revenue models in the quarter. We ended the quarter with strong bookings momentum across our B&I Software businesses. Segment margins in the quarter were over 30%, representing a record fourth quarter for the segment despite cost inflation and the higher growth of hardware revenues. In B&I our price increases more than offset the hardware cost inflation, we saw in the quarter. Geospatial segment revenue increased 15% overall and 16% on an organic basis. Demand for our core survey and mapping portfolio remains very strong across all regions driven by strong spending in residential construction, civil infrastructure and utilities. Segment revenues also benefited from shipments against several large government contracts. Operating margins were below the levels of fourth quarter 2020 and the third quarter of 2021, driven principally by a short-term mix shift. The cost inflation we experienced in this segment was largely but not entirely offset by our 5% price increase and lower discounting. Resources and Utilities revenue grew 18% in total and 21% organically. Hardware backlog grew in R&U, reflective of very strong demand across the agriculture sector. The outlook for capital investment in ag remained strong driven by high crop prices, low inventories and high average equipment age. Segment margins were below those of a year ago and sequentially below third quarter levels. Product cost inflation was particularly high in this segment, as the cost of many critical components in our ag product offerings increased substantially in the quarter. In this segment our price increases have not yet kept up with inflation and we continue to refine our pricing strategy going forward. We anticipate operating margins in this segment in the coming year to rebound from the fourth quarter 2021 levels, as our price realization and mix improve. Consistent with our expectation coming into Q4, revenues and margins in our transportation segment were adversely impacted by supply chain challenges, both within our business and at our OEM customers. On the cost side, we experienced meaningful component inflation and high freight costs and we incurred costs related to realigning our product portfolio, toward available components. Slow production levels at our OEM customers also constrained our revenue of both hardware and recurring services in the quarter. The leading indicators from our transportation business continue to give us confidence that we are on the path to better ARR and margin trends, once the dynamics of the supply chain improve. We grew bookings year-on-year once again in Q4 and our net retention is at 100%. Our OEM customers are seeing stabilization in their own supply chain situation and we expect that orders from them will pick up early this year. Finally, on the cost side, we are introducing new products, which will support improved gross margins. For all these reasons, we project improved performance across the Transportation segment and ARR revenue and margins in the back half of 2022. Turning now to slide nine, I'd like to provide our financial outlook for 2022. We expect to see continued topline momentum. Demand from our end markets remain strong and so far, we haven't seen any signs of deceleration as a result of recent inflation and higher interest rates. Our backlog and forward-looking indicators of sentiment give us confidence in our prospects for ARR and revenue growth. As Rob and I have mentioned, we expect that supply chain disruptions will continue to be with us through 2022. There are signs that the pressure on component availability will abate in the back half of the year, but our plans presume that the supply chain will not be fully restored to equilibrium until 2023. With those factors in mind, we are initiating annual guidance for 2022. Excluding the impact of any additional acquisitions or divestitures, we project full year revenue of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, representing a range of growth outlooks of 8% to 11%. Our continuing transition of software offerings will present approximately 100 basis points of headwind to revenue growth. Organic ARR growth is expected to accelerate through the year to a mid-teens rate by year-end. We expect gross margins in 2022 to be comparable to or slightly better than 2021, with sequential improvement in the back half of the year. We expect that operating margins for the full year will be approximately 23%. Note that operating margins will be adversely impacted by the aforementioned subscription transitions, as well as investments we are making in support of our strategy and the acceleration of ARR. In aggregate, these factors present a headwind to operating margins of approximately 200 basis points. Income from equity investments is projected to be approximately $30 million, lower than 2021 due to higher product costs in our joint ventures. Net interest expense is forecast to be approximately $65 million and we project that our tax rate will be approximately 18%. Netting all this out, we project to achieve EPS in the range of $2.75 to $2.95. From a cash flow perspective, we project the free cash flow will once again exceed our non-GAAP net income. Our cash flow trends will be helped by the projected return toward equilibrium in the supply chain, as we anticipate needing lower component inventories by the end of the year. While we are focusing our guidance on expectations for the full year, I'd like to provide some color on the factors we expect to drive quarterly trends in 2022. Many of the normal seasonal patterns in our business are being disrupted by the impact of the constrained supply chain, so it is most helpful to think in terms of the expected sequential development from where we ended Q4 of 2021. We expect revenue to grow sequentially through each quarter of the year with ARR accelerating as well. From a product cost perspective, we expect to see inflation through the first half of 2022, similar to what we experienced in Q4 of 2021, with meaningful improvement in the second half. As a result, gross margins are likely to be relatively flat with Q4 of 2021 through the first half of the year and meaningfully higher in the second half. We expect that operating margins in the second half of the year will exceed the first half by approximately 150 basis points. I'll close by noting that we are planning an Investor Day in Colorado this September. And with that I'll turn it back over to Rob. \nRob Painter: We entered the COVID crisis almost two years ago. And at that time, we set an objective to exit the crisis on a stronger competitive footing. I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2021 and the progress and commitment we are making towards our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. We are a purpose-driven company serving secularly attractive markets, pursuing a differentiated strategy to connect the physical and digital worlds, with a unique set of underlying capabilities. We deliver a compelling value proposition to our customers in the form of better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener and we deliver a compelling business model to our shareholders. No doubt, we expect to operate in a turbulent environment for the foreseeable future while simultaneously undergoing our own transformation. The last couple of years serve as evidence, that this team has the courage and conviction to rise to the challenge. Operator let's please go to Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good morning, guys.\nRob Painter: Good morning.\nChad Dillard: So my first question is just on the guidance. So what are you contemplating at the low end of your earnings guide? Because it implies about 3% growth and so as I'm kind of like looking through it, first of all, on the revenue side, at the low end you're at 7%. But if you're talking about price realization of plus 5% and then ARR growth in the teens it seems like that would imply a kind of low single-digit or flattish growth on hardware. So just hoping, you could just kind of just give me a sense for how you're thinking about that low end and the reality of hitting that. \nDavid Barnes: Hi, Chad. This is David Barnes. I think the low end is 8% revenue growth. And I think your math is right there's some pricing in there. I'll note that the revenue growth will be impacted by about 100 basis points of transition, from perpetual to recurring some of our software businesses. We do expect hardware growth to moderate versus what we've seen this year. We'll be working through the backlog, but those are some of the big building blocks. \nChad Dillard: Got it. Okay. And then just secondly, on your incremental margins. So the guidance implies about 18%. And during the third quarter, I believe you guys talked about being at the low end of 25% to 30%. So I'm just trying to understand, what changed and perhaps you could just help us bridge that gap. \nDavid Barnes: Sure. The big -- if there's a change and there is a bit of a change it's that we're going to see more inflation than we had anticipated in the first half of 2022. Our outlook was a little more optimistic on that front. It's now clear that the supply chain being choked up, is going to last at least at some level through the end of next year. And we don't think the inflation scenario, in terms of our product costs will get meaningfully better. The guidance presumes sort of plateauing at Q4 levels. We do expect to see some price realization. I talked in the prepared remarks about margins in Ag. The sort of bad news of a lot of backlog is when you implement another price increase, you don't see it in revenue, right away. So those are the principal factors that would have operating leverage lower than we had indicated earlier. But I will point out that the deliberate decisions we're making in terms of model transition from perpetual to recurring, and then the investments against our strategic initiatives, each of those takes 100 basis points or so out of margins that we would have next year, if we weren't doing those things and that would generate very healthy operating leverage. \nRob Painter: Chad, one other piece of color on that is compare 2022 in the mid guide to 2019 and we're talking over 45% operating leverage over that time. \nChad Dillard: Got it. Thanks I\u2019ll pass it on. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open. Please ask your question. \nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. There's a lot of obviously volatility in the supply chain. Could you be a little bit more specific, if you're willing on what is getting better into 2H, what you have visibility on? There's some talk on chips getting better. I don't know if that's been a big headwind. And then just your general feeling, is it stable in 1Q? There's obviously a lot of Omicron tick up potential and things like that. I don't know if it started getting better already in any ways? Thanks.\nDavid Barnes: Yeah. Hey, Rob. I'll say that the supply chain challenges you hear a lot of talk about semiconductors, but the issues are broader than that. With regard to electronics, I would say things are already improving. Part of that is that we several months ago took a number of steps including raising our outlook and making commitments with vendors placing orders that actually impacted our cash flow. We've worked component by component. We've seen meaningful progress. We're actually seeing visibility to capacity on some of our individual constrained parts with specific vendors. So that's getting better. And the fruits of our effort to redesign our products around very scarce components all of those show signs of improvements. Actually, where things are stickiest now is the non-electronics. It's cables, it's brackets, it's other kinds of parts. And that is sort of the downstream impact of labor disruptions in many markets all around the world. So that probably has a longer fuse to it. But you put all that together, that adds up to the outlook we described in the prepared remarks, which is yeah, we'll see inflation in constrained overall supply through the first half of the year and we'll see meaningful improvement albeit not all the way back to normal by year-end.\nRob Wertheimer: And then begging your pardon, if you're willing to be so granular, you mentioned you have backlog so you don't have pricing coming through and resources and so on. The back half margin improvement, is that more pricing? Is that more like you assume expedite freight goes away? Is it more proven in all the things you just discussed, if you're willing? And I'll stop there. Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: Sure. There are many components. Looking at inflation, I think you can group it in a few buckets. There's the underlying just price increases from the suppliers and from our freight providers. And then there's expedited freight, where you use air freight instead of seaborne freight for instance. And then there's buying components in the broker market. And when you buy components in the broker market, the price can be not a few percent higher, but multiples higher than the normal purchase price. So the outlook for improved margins in the back half of the year is that we have a lot less of the use of the broker market. We have less expedited freight. We do think though that there will be underlying inflation that will be with us. But you'll see the full impact of the price increases including the ones we haven't taken yet or where we've taken them, they haven't flown through the backlog. And then over time, the mix of our business will improve. I'll point out that our revenues were up about 12% in the quarter and our hardware revenues in Q4 were up 20%. So that's not helpful to margin. And all those -- that will abate as well. So we add all that up, we think that's how we get to meaningfully better margins in the second half than the first half.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thanks.\nDavid Barnes: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nColin Rusch: Thanks, so much. I want to ask about the AgileAssets acquisition. I just wanted to get a sense of the speed of the integration into the Trimble platform, and how you're thinking about the digital trend opportunity in terms of customer engagement and expansion of total addressable market?\nRob Painter: Hi. Good morning, Colin. It's Rob. So hey, AgileAssets fits perfectly into our strategy. We think it's really in the center of the bull's-eye. It's a growing SaaS business and it connects well with the broader Trimble platform. So it is a growth story and we've got a high conviction that we can grow this business on its own and that it can be a catalyst for the growth of other Trimble solutions. When we put it in context of the digital twin in the prepared remarks, we talked about this intersection point of the as-maintained model with an as-designed and an as-built. So if you think about it from the life cycle point of view, which is really central to our strategy, this adds really that final step in the operations and maintenance phase. And so a digital twin in its truest form is much broader than a design model and often people will talk about it more in a design sense. We think the combination and intersection of the design with the as-built with the as-maintained is actually a true digital twin and the early indication we have from joint customers and from departments of transportation is quite encouraging to us. \nColin Rusch: Great. And then shifting gears to the transportation and logistics business. With the real progress that's being made around Class 8 trucking moving towards autonomy and the more comprehensive software systems that we're starting to see emerge in that space. How are you thinking about evolving the strategy for Trimble in that space? It seems like there's an awful lot to do, but also a lot to shift around. And so the cadence of change would be helpful just in terms of your internal thought process and how you see that business evolve for Trimble?\nRob Painter: We see autonomy as it emerges in transportation. I'd say at some level similar to agriculture or construction. And that is in an autonomous world which by the way is probably really more of a more automated world in an autonomous world, the truck still needs to have a work plan. It still needs to understand how to route and how to navigate. It still needs to understand how to optimize within the entire fleet. It still needs to understand how to give a dynamic estimated time of arrival to the customer. It needs the brains behind it. Arguably, the autonomous vehicle or dozer or tractor is a dumb node. It doesn't know what to do. It needs a work order. It needs a work plan. It needs that brain. And that intersected with what we do at Trimble in the office the systems of record, the scheduling, routing, dispatch we think provide high relevance in a more automated world. In addition there's autonomous capabilities that we can provide companies on highway. So for instance in our correction services business, we now have over 10 million miles that have been managed through our correction services which are really providing ADAS capabilities. \nColin Rusch: That\u2019s super helpful. I will follow-up offline. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nTami Zakaria: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So the Resource and Utilities margins in the quarter came in below where we were expecting. Can you expand on that a little bit? And why do you expect unfavorable mix in the near-term? And related to that what is your outlook for agriculture demand longer term in light of farmers moving towards vision and AI technologies?\nDavid Barnes: I'll defer the longer-term question to Rob. With regard to margins Tami, there's a story both of mix and of higher input costs. There are a number of key components in our displays for guidance in agriculture where the supply was particularly tight. I mentioned a moment ago that when the markets are tight we and other providers of hardware technology have to go to the broker market to fill the needs. And in some cases a part that would normally cost $3 costs $30 or $40. So it's easy to see really dramatic cost spikes that happened disproportionately in this segment. So we've taken pricing actions. But in this particular segment the cost increases are meaningfully higher. So we're relooking at our pricing strategy and we're going to have to take some actions to improve our margins going forward. We do think there's partly a story of mix here and what we were shipping in Q4 is disproportionately on the lower end of the margin scale. So it will get better. But no doubt we have a margin challenge to wrestle with in this segment. And Rob you want to talk about the longer-term outlook? \nRob Painter: Yes. Actually the other thing -- color I can add to the numbers is you know the revenue in the segment was up over 18%. ARR was in the mid-teens growth. Agriculture hardware revenue was above 30%. That's -- put the margins in context of the extraordinary growth we have in this business we are making conscious choices to meet the demand the extraordinary demand that's out there in the market. And we saw, the backlog continue to grow in the business. So really feel good about the market demand out there. And there's a correlation between the extraordinary demand and the margins. So those factors, as we move forward that's part of why we think we can \u2013 that will come to equilibrium. In terms of the ongoing outlook in agriculture and our views on that, hey, the indicators look good at the moment in the agriculture business. So the macros are in support of the growth plans that we have. If we look at farm income, it's projected \u2013 2021 was probably the high point for farm income. The expectations for farm income in 2022 are 20% to 30% above the 10-year average. So punch line is farm income is expected to remain strong. That's a US statistic that, I'm giving you. And that's able to outpace the increase in the inputs that \u2013 input prices, sorry \u2013 that farmers are paying. So the reason that farm income can stay up is, because commodity prices are up they remain up and inventory levels remain low. Now, look at the input prices being higher and connect that to a point of view, we have on the adoption of technology on a go-forward basis. That's exactly what the technology can do is it can minimize and optimize the use of those inputs. Less seed higher yield; less use of herbicide to spot spray, which also by the way brings a sustainability benefit to the farm. So those factors in aggregate continue to have us bullish on the adoption of Precision Ag technologies going forward, and I'd say also on a global basis.\nTami Zakaria: Understood. That's helpful. That's all for me. Thank you so much.\nRob Painter: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nGal Munda: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe the first one just trying to understand a little bit the dynamics around the business model transitions, maybe if you can update us a little bit. And when you say expectations about 100 basis points headwind to kind of the margins and the growth for FY 2022, which are the brands that are mostly impacting that? And maybe, if we look forward, how long do you think that headwind still lasts? And at what stage it almost becomes a tailwind as well once you kind of cross that majority of the revenue being subscription based on some of those brands as well? Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: Sure, Gal. It's David. I'll look both a little bit backward and forward. So for the full year, the measurement we do indicates that the transition impact in 2021 was about 100 basis points negative impact to revenue. That's actually less than we thought going into the year. And the reason, it's less is that we had higher last-time buys of perpetual offerings in our structural design business. So right now, the impact the vast majority of the impact the 100 basis points whether it's for full year 2021, or full year 2022 are in our building software businesses. There's a decent chunk in the transportation business as well. Actually, we're going to see a piece of it in the civil software \u2013 civil construction software business, as we roll out our platform-as-a-service model. So you asked about the longer outlook. I'll tell you that the \u2013 if you look at our perpetual software revenue just under $500 million for 2021, we're already at a point where 70% or 75% of that perpetual software is sold bundled with hardware. So the straight software offerings are only 25% of it, by which I mean to say, we will at the end of 2022 be through the significant majority of the model transitions on the straight software businesses. But we are looking to transform to recurring revenue models the platform-as-a-service where \u2013 that's where we're moving, and we'll have some meaningful revenue in civil construction this year. We also have bundled perpetual software with hardware in the surveying business and in Ag, and that will be further out. So it's a little early to call on, how long that transition will take. Actually that's a topic we plan to cover off at our investor conference in September. But that's less straightforward to transition than a traditional software business. You've got -- you're bundled with hardware, you've got multiple regions and dealers. And so it's a harder problem to solve. It's likely to take several years.\nGal Munda: Got you. And then maybe as a follow-up. When I look at the -- it still has a negative impact on the margins. But like we said, if the transition stopped today on what you've already transitioned, it seems like incremental margins are being helped, if that makes sense, if we excel that, because if I calculate correctly, we're into kind of four of these incremental margins that we had kind of that two basis -- two percentage points of less of a headwind this year to what you expected and 100 basis points of that is actually coming from business model transitions. So if I look at an organic as it is today business, as it stands, and as it's already -- if you weren't transitioning it, is it fair to say that the outlook for the margins would have been kind of higher than historically has been on incrementals? \nDavid Barnes : Yes. So I think I'm following you Gal. The margins are really high on both perpetual software and recurring. The difference is that when you sell subscription, you recognize the revenue and margin over many years rather than upfront. So I think our math is good that the conversions we're doing reduce revenue versus if you'd stayed in the perpetual model by the numbers we're saying and it essentially all goes through to the bottom line.\nRob Painter: And Gal, this is Rob. You're absolutely right by the math. If we were only targeting an op leverage number, you wouldn't do the transitions, that's the wrong decision to take for the customers and for the market. So you're absolutely hitting on an important point that we will all day long look to convert the business models for the long-term health of the business. And I think it's more important or certainly equally important that the Street is looking at the growth in the ARR, the look on our cash flow, the net working capital as factors to complement what an EBITDA percentage or an operating income percentage will tell you because it's an incomplete story.\nGal Munda: Great. Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning everyone.\nRob Painter: Hi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could talk about the outlook for mid-teens ARR growth exiting the year. Really interesting outlook considering e-Builder and Viewpoint are delivering that level of growth now. So I'm wondering what needs to happen in transportation to get to that run rate. Or are you looking for an acceleration or further acceleration in e-Builder and Viewpoint to get there? Maybe just give us a little bit more clarity on what drives the acceleration from 11% today?\nRob Painter: Hey, Jerry, this is Rob. I think that is arguably the story in this earnings release is the level of ARR growth that we exited the year with meets the ARR projection that David went through in the prepared remarks. You can look at the backlog that we have, the reported backlog that's in the financials, as evidence that we have a growing amount of revenue to serve. So, in other words, we've got a high level of visibility. We had strong bookings in the fourth quarter in aggregate. So, yes, the e-Builder and Viewpoint businesses, those continue to grow ARR in the mid-teens. And I'll say, bookings were -- grew faster than that. So the bookings are the forward indicator to the revenue that will eventually be recognized. Now the other catalyst on top of that, Jerry, is that structures business that we talked about were -- that's the Tekla Structures business that made the model conversion in 2021 that will be part of that growth in 2022. Yes, we do anticipate some increase in transportation, but this projection that David made is not entirely dependent on it. In fact we have rather modest expectations on transportation. So to the extent that that is a lot better that could be a little potential upside for us. So, we are squarely focused on growing the recurring revenue, the digital transformation investments we're making, David talked about that, almost 100 bps of investment we make into that. That's the correlation to make to the ARR growth. It is an enabler of that ARR growth and we're absolutely committed to these transformation investments in order to drive these attractive revenue streams.\nDavid Barnes: Yes. Rob got it right, Jerry. We're at or close to mid-teens in the ARR growth of our businesses other than transportation. We're much lower than that in transportation. And we do project a recovery. We don't think we'll get all the way to numbers we think are good long-term by the end of the year, but the outlook presumes that we maintain and put some momentum across the businesses that are growing well now outside transportation and the transportation begins meaningful growth. So you put all that together, we get to mid-teens. And if we do even more than that then we'll be on the high end of our outlook. But that's how we get there.\nJerry Revich: Very interesting. And David, based on the numbers you shared on SketchUp, it sounds like user growth has tripled in that business, give or take since the transition to subscription. Are you on track with that level of performance in Tekla? And are you thinking about the remaining conversions that are in front of us with that type of user growth potential, or were there any outliers on SketchUp that we should be thinking about?\nRob Painter: I'd be careful about extrapolating from SketchUp to all the other businesses. Certainly, the SketchUp story is an amazing one. It really is sort of great flagship example of how changing the business model expands the addressable market on SketchUp. It has a quasi-consumer appeal, which Tekla would not. It's a very sophisticated product. So we're early days in the model conversion on Tekla. I don't think you'll see the expansion in the addressable market in that offering that we've had in SketchUp.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nJason Celino: Great. Hi, Rob. Hey, David. Appreciate the morning call this time around. As it relates to M&A, the business has delevered very nicely over the past couple of years. And with these Connect & Scale initiatives and streamlining the business, how should we think about M&A strategy and specifically, where larger M&A might fit in?\nRob Painter: In context of Connect & Scale, I think about two dynamics. One -- actually, I think three dynamics. One is our own organic progression and we -- the second is acquisition and the third is partnership. From our own organic progression, we believe we have an immense opportunity just to mine the data and the customer opportunities within -- I'll say, within the house. In other words, the cross-sell and the up-sell within the Trimble portfolio as evidence of that is our Trimble Construction One launch where we're creating persona-based bundles to go after the construction industry to better serve those customers. So, that's our primary use I'll say of capital allocation. Second, from an acquisition standpoint, we're definitely open to acquisition, not for the sake of acquisition if it helps accelerate the strategy. And so the two vectors we tend to look at on acquisitions are: one, product capabilities; and two, geographic reach. Sometimes, those are the same and sometimes, they're mutually exclusive. The majority of acquisitions we've done over time have looked more like a tuck-in than transformative and large ones. We've tended to do the larger ones every few years. And I wouldn't say that's by design. It's been more by availability. So we are certainly open to that. There's a bit of a bifurcation in the market where there's the really, I'll say, almost mega caps, at least mega cap defined in a Trimble context, and then the long tail of small companies. There's not too many in the middle. So, there's a bit of a scarcity of assets. So, we're absolutely open to it. We obviously have the balance sheet and we think we've got the right strategy. So if the fit is there we will pursue. On the partnership angle, I mentioned that because in a platform strategy, which is what connected scale is, we believe that partnerships are more important than ever to build out that ecosystem. We have a long track record of partnerships. We've got a joint venture with Caterpillar in civil construction; we've got a joint venture with Hilti in building construction; we've got a joint venture with Nikon in our survey and mapping business. We announced that relationship with Microsoft, a few months ago. We think that that is an important partnership to help us extend the reach and the capabilities of what we do. And as we open up, our technology to third parties and those ecosystems to help us extend that I think that's another point of evidence, of where our partnerships will come into play. And then I'd like to believe, that those partnerships which could also come through a Trimble Ventures arm could become acquisition candidates down the road.\nJason Celino: Okay. Interesting. And then when I think about this year and the focus on investments in infrastructure, economy and digital transformation, is the correct way to think about this maybe at the product level, the go-to-market level and then also at the back-end system level? Thanks.\nRob Painter: Yes, I think that's a fair way to think about it. I -- the words I tend to use internally are strategy structure systems. I believe an organizational structure follows the strategy and I believe the underlying systems are meant to be enablers of that structure and ultimately the strategy. So in the strategy of Connect & Scale, we see an enormous opportunity around the infrastructure bill since I think that's what you were asking about, when you said infrastructure. You may have meant our internal infrastructure. But if we're talking the IAJA, we see a large opportunity there that connects to the acquisition of AgileAssets to bring more aspects of Trimble together to positively impact the opportunity inside of construction. So within that strategy, then we organized ourselves. Well, sorry, actually also on the strategy side, yes that captures product and go-to-market. So I totally agree with you there. You've got to have -- and the product looks like the Suite, the collections of our technology and the go-to-market for us has as you look in the totality of Trimble has a hybrid aspect of direct and indirect that comes together. Okay. Then on the organizational structure side, we organize ourselves around the industries that we serve. So we have an industry leader for civil construction, for building construction, for agriculture, for survey and mapping for transportation. So we have that single point of accountability, to those end markets that we're serving. And then the underlying systems that captures some of the digital transformation systems work that we are doing, to give us that ability to better serve customers and to help us scale efficiently and effectively. \nJason Celino: Thanks, Rob. Thank you\nRob Painter: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason [ph]. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Good morning. Rob, you had noted the platform-as-a-service opportunity lies ahead of you still for the most part. How should we be thinking that impacts the recurring revenue gross margin or recurring gross margin as that occurs? The simple math would suggest some hardware mix flows towards that line item. But is there an opportunity for in, which case -- at a gross margin level would the math suggests somewhat dilutive but is there an opportunity there the strategy there to make that less so than maybe face value would tell you?\nRob Painter: Yeah. I'll give you the strategy setup and David can fill in the blanks on the numbers. So platform-as-a-service, that's the I'll say the branding name we've had on the machine control and guidance business in civil. In other words, think about taking that guidance business as a ratable offering that combines hardware and software. The fundamental value proposition to the customer is that of technology assurance, being able to stay on the latest version of sensors, or software, gives them ability to better connect to the office-based solutions we have and the connectivity solutions we have, to really round trip the data to and from the field to connect that physical/digital, to connect the office/field, connect the hardware and the software. So that's the reason and the value proposition that we pursue this. So let's take a guidance system and let's just use round numbers and say it's a $30,000 system today that a customer buys. In that system, you're buying a set of sensors, hardware and embedded software. The embedded software is actually what drives a lot of and creates a lot of that value. It's the enabling aspect of it today. Now today, the way the accounting works is we would take in that $30,000 example, we would take all of that revenue today. The way the accounting works is that the value is attributed partially to software, perpetual software and -- so that embedded software attributed to perpetual software and then the rest to hardware. So that's where David refers to it as a bundle. So what we see is that more and more of the value comes through the software aspect of the offering. And so that software aspect of the offering, so the portion of that $30,000 that's attributed to software that's what we look to take -- that's one of the things we look to take ratable over time. And that's a global offering that we just announced. Now in the US, we've been doing the whole thing as a ratable service. The accounting makes you take the hardware upfront even though it's ratable. And it's that software that you can take over time. And this global offering that we now have, that's the primary offering buy the hardware upfront and then the software becomes ratable. So in the short term, I think that's a hit to margin just like you would have in any software business that moves from perpetual to ratable. What we need to then be able to demonstrate through the numbers and it probably shows up as a term license and therefore in the ARR number is that we can show that ARR growth and link that to any offset in the margin. Now that's the short term. As you build the cumulative base, your margins slip and then you actually, as we know get back to parity and then have the value expansion opportunity from there, just on the base offering and that's before we talk about the upsell and the linkage to the rest of what we do. Dave, would you add anything? \nDavid Barnes: No, I think you nailed it, Rob. So even when you sell a bundle of hardware and software and solutions together, just the way the accounting works, is you figure out how much of the value is hardware and you do recognize that upfront. I think what's -- but the mega trend going on here that's in the context of the model transition, as Rob said is more and more of the value is with the software and solutions and relatively less of the hardware. So the impact on the P&L of the transition whereas today, historically the way we do it we recognize all the hardware and all the software and solutions upfront. As we go ratable on the software and the services, that will have a similar impact that it does on all of our other software businesses. So it will -- what you'll see in the accounting is the hardware still stays upfront, although hardware makes up less and less of the value of the old solution. And then when you go ratable on the solution, then the software part gets spread out overtime.\nUnidentified Analyst: I see. I see. Thanks for the explanation. I'll just -- one quick follow-up. Just David, as you think about the guidance for revenue for 2022, what are you assuming in terms of backlog reduction within that call it 9% to 12% or so organic?\nDavid Barnes: Yeah. So I'll ground it in the -- my comments and the notion that the supply chain won't get back to equilibrium even by the end of 2022. So just round numbers hardware backlog in a normal world is $100 million. We're at nearly four times that somewhere around $375 million. We're likely to get halfway back or more than halfway back, but still be well above the 100 level.\nUnidentified Analyst: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nWeston Twigg: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I know you talked about ARR this year. But really I'm wondering if you could help us understand, your revenue by segment in terms of which segments may grow faster or slower than the overall top line revenue. And the reason I ask is, just because you mentioned certain supply chain constraints worse in the agricultural area. And I'm just wondering how much that might slow down revenue in certain segments. So any help there would be great.\nDavid Barnes: As a general trend, it's unlikely that we'll see hardware revenue outstrip total revenue like we did in the fourth quarter. The other book end, I'll put it that obviously our transportation revenue trends have been more modest than the other segments, and we do expect in the second half of the year an uplift in transportation. But the rest of the businesses are actually quite similar in the sense that demand is very strong backlog is big. Just by the numbers Geospatial of these segments is most hardware related. So we've just had extraordinary growth. And it's -- we're outgrowing by everything we can measure the market in those solutions. So you're likely to see that segment slow more than the others, but we have a really big backlog in construction and agriculture. And yes, so I think you'll see lowest growth in transportation particularly in the first half. Geospatial, just because its hardware dependent will be lower and the other segments will be -- we expect to be very strong.\nWeston Twigg: That's very helpful. And then, just to follow up real quickly. Gross margin you suggested it would be higher in the second half kind of similar to Q4 through the first half. What kind of level can you help us understand what kind of level gross margin could hit exiting the year as supply chain starts to get back to normal?\nDavid Barnes: I think the math is probably pretty easy, if we end up near where we were in Q4 for the first two quarters. And then we'll end the year at or maybe modestly above full year 2021. That will -- I think that gets you there. It will be -- the modeling of that won't get you to 60%, but it will get you closer than the 58% where we are now. So ...\nWeston Twigg: Perfect. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. You may continue.\nRob Painter: Thank you everyone for joining us on the call. And we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Let's begin on Page 2 with the following key messages. Our team once again delivered outstanding results and did so amidst ongoing supply chain difficulties, delivering total organic revenue growth of 14% and organic ARR growth of 12% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year at a record level of ARR of $1.41 billion, and 2021 EBITDA margin of 25.6%, and operating cash flow of $751 million. Reflecting on our 2021 results in comparison to our May 2018 Investor Day plan, I am proud to say our team made a great deal of progress. In May 2018, we targeted 2021 adjusted EBITDA between 23% to 24% of revenue. We closed 2021 at 25.6% EBITDA. We targeted software services and recurring revenue mix at 55% of total revenue. We closed 2021 at 55%. We targeted the ratio of 2021 operating cash flow to non-GAAP net income at approximately 1.1 times, and we closed 2021 at 1.11 times. In July 2018, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood above three times and we said we would delever below 2.5 times. Today we stand at 1.0 times. These proof points give us conviction that we are on the right strategic path with Connect & Scale 2025 that we can uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds, to deliver value to our customers, and that our asset-light business model works for our shareholders. Looking at current market conditions, the overall demand landscape remains robust and we enter the year with record hardware backlog and record ARR. Nevertheless, we are paying close attention to three obvious market factors: interest rates, supply chain and labor market dynamics. While the overall landscape presents material short to mid-term planning challenges, what is straightforward is that the global infrastructure spend is a positive catalyst for the long-term health of the business and that in difficult economic environment our value proposition that delivers productivity and sustainability will remain a secular growth catalyst. Moving to page 3. I'll talk about the progression of our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy, as seen through the lens of the Trimble Operating System capturing strategy, people and execution. Starting with strategy. I'll provide three proof points of our progress in the quarter. First, we acquired AgileAssets, which provides SaaS solutions with analytical tools to manage roads, bridges, airports and rail assets, so customers can better plan, operate and report on those assets across the life cycle. The addition of AgileAssets to Trimble's platform will add the as-maintained model to our as-designed and as-built data. Availability of this data within the model creates a robust digital twin for owners throughout the asset life cycle, thereby providing greater predictability, sustainability and lower lifetime asset costs. Second, we have increased our ambitions in the area of sustainability both internally with our own carbon footprint and externally through the commercialization of sustainability. We have submitted our science-based targets for review, and we plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement. In addition, our most recent score from the climate disclosure project went up again, marking two increases since we first submitted in 2018, and we continue to work diligently to further improve our score. With an external lens, customers are increasingly asking us to help them think about, manage and verify carbon reductions from the productivity and efficiency gains delivered through the use of our products. We have stepped up our ambition level to meet this market opportunity. Third, we have continued to transform our software and hardware business model offerings, which has translated into increased bookings and ARR, which in turn gives us visibility into continued growth in 2022. Our Connect & Scale strategy is a platform strategy, and we are executing that strategy in part by partnering to build ecosystems. As evidence, we have a new Microsoft partnership that will first focus on construction, and we established Trimble Ventures in the third quarter and made our first ventures investment in the fourth quarter. Moving to people in our operating system, I start by reflecting on our purpose in the world. We are transforming and digitizing industries that support how we live, what we eat and how we move. In a competitive labor environment, we continue to see people attracted to the why of Trimble. We won a couple of Global Culture Survey awards in the fourth quarter both for overall company culture and for diversity. We made demonstrable progress in our DEI journey in 2021 and our team continues to engage in their local and global communities through company-sponsored days of service and through our Trimble Foundation. We believe the intersection of a great workplace environment and a purpose-driven organization provides a solid foundation upon which to lead, grow and compete for talent. We were also able to recruit Ann Fandozzi to our Board in 2021. And in January, we announced the addition of Tom Sweet, Dell's CFO to our Board. I'm encouraged by individuals of this global caliber enthusiastically joining our Board and contributing to our ongoing growth. Moving to execution in the Trimble Operating System, we saw the benefits of ongoing innovation throughout the course of 2021. In the fourth quarter, we reached a milestone of one million monthly active users of Trimble Connect. With our digital transformation efforts making progress, we now have all of these users on common identity and entitlement stacks. We launched the new trimble.com web presence in December, the culmination of a couple of years' worth of work to modernize this important vehicle. We've also stepped up our outbound efforts to tell our story and to reach important new audiences. We look forward to hosting some in-person events in 2022 and such as our Transportation User Conference in August and our Dimensions User Conference for engineering and construction in November. Finally, we see our fundamental responsibility to shareholders as being capital allocators, balancing short-term realities with long-term possibility. To this end, we divested three businesses in 2021 on top of the four divestitures in 2020. In 2022, we will disproportionately invest in areas of the company such as the infrastructure opportunity, autonomy and our own digital transformation. We make these investments and are accelerating the transition to recurring revenue models of a number of our software businesses in the context of a challenging supply chain environment, which is constraining our ability to meet customer demand and adding inflationary pressures. The steps we are taking will moderate our operating leverage over the next few quarters but will move us forward in our ability to reach the full potential of our strategy. Before I turn it over to David, a big shout out to all 11,500 plus Trimble team members for your ongoing dedication and execution to our global dealer partners and to our strategic partners for their efforts, and to all of you in the investment community who trust us with your capital. David, over to you. We entered the COVID crisis almost two years ago. And at that time, we set an objective to exit the crisis on a stronger competitive footing. I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2021 and the progress and commitment we are making towards our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. We are a purpose-driven company serving secularly attractive markets, pursuing a differentiated strategy to connect the physical and digital worlds, with a unique set of underlying capabilities. We deliver a compelling value proposition to our customers in the form of better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener and we deliver a compelling business model to our shareholders. No doubt, we expect to operate in a turbulent environment for the foreseeable future while simultaneously undergoing our own transformation. The last couple of years serve as evidence, that this team has the courage and conviction to rise to the challenge. Operator let's please go to Q&A. Good morning. Chad, one other piece of color on that is compare 2022 in the mid guide to 2019 and we're talking over 45% operating leverage over that time. Hi. Good morning, Colin. It's Rob. So hey, AgileAssets fits perfectly into our strategy. We think it's really in the center of the bull's-eye. It's a growing SaaS business and it connects well with the broader Trimble platform. So it is a growth story and we've got a high conviction that we can grow this business on its own and that it can be a catalyst for the growth of other Trimble solutions. When we put it in context of the digital twin in the prepared remarks, we talked about this intersection point of the as-maintained model with an as-designed and an as-built. So if you think about it from the life cycle point of view, which is really central to our strategy, this adds really that final step in the operations and maintenance phase. And so a digital twin in its truest form is much broader than a design model and often people will talk about it more in a design sense. We think the combination and intersection of the design with the as-built with the as-maintained is actually a true digital twin and the early indication we have from joint customers and from departments of transportation is quite encouraging to us. We see autonomy as it emerges in transportation. I'd say at some level similar to agriculture or construction. And that is in an autonomous world which by the way is probably really more of a more automated world in an autonomous world, the truck still needs to have a work plan. It still needs to understand how to route and how to navigate. It still needs to understand how to optimize within the entire fleet. It still needs to understand how to give a dynamic estimated time of arrival to the customer. It needs the brains behind it. Arguably, the autonomous vehicle or dozer or tractor is a dumb node. It doesn't know what to do. It needs a work order. It needs a work plan. It needs that brain. And that intersected with what we do at Trimble in the office the systems of record, the scheduling, routing, dispatch we think provide high relevance in a more automated world. In addition there's autonomous capabilities that we can provide companies on highway. So for instance in our correction services business, we now have over 10 million miles that have been managed through our correction services which are really providing ADAS capabilities. Yes. Actually the other thing -- color I can add to the numbers is you know the revenue in the segment was up over 18%. ARR was in the mid-teens growth. Agriculture hardware revenue was above 30%. That's -- put the margins in context of the extraordinary growth we have in this business we are making conscious choices to meet the demand the extraordinary demand that's out there in the market. And we saw, the backlog continue to grow in the business. So really feel good about the market demand out there. And there's a correlation between the extraordinary demand and the margins. So those factors, as we move forward that's part of why we think we can \u2013 that will come to equilibrium. In terms of the ongoing outlook in agriculture and our views on that, hey, the indicators look good at the moment in the agriculture business. So the macros are in support of the growth plans that we have. If we look at farm income, it's projected \u2013 2021 was probably the high point for farm income. The expectations for farm income in 2022 are 20% to 30% above the 10-year average. So punch line is farm income is expected to remain strong. That's a US statistic that, I'm giving you. And that's able to outpace the increase in the inputs that \u2013 input prices, sorry \u2013 that farmers are paying. So the reason that farm income can stay up is, because commodity prices are up they remain up and inventory levels remain low. Now, look at the input prices being higher and connect that to a point of view, we have on the adoption of technology on a go-forward basis. That's exactly what the technology can do is it can minimize and optimize the use of those inputs. Less seed higher yield; less use of herbicide to spot spray, which also by the way brings a sustainability benefit to the farm. So those factors in aggregate continue to have us bullish on the adoption of Precision Ag technologies going forward, and I'd say also on a global basis. You're welcome. And Gal, this is Rob. You're absolutely right by the math. If we were only targeting an op leverage number, you wouldn't do the transitions, that's the wrong decision to take for the customers and for the market. So you're absolutely hitting on an important point that we will all day long look to convert the business models for the long-term health of the business. And I think it's more important or certainly equally important that the Street is looking at the growth in the ARR, the look on our cash flow, the net working capital as factors to complement what an EBITDA percentage or an operating income percentage will tell you because it's an incomplete story. Hi, Jerry. Hey, Jerry, this is Rob. I think that is arguably the story in this earnings release is the level of ARR growth that we exited the year with meets the ARR projection that David went through in the prepared remarks. You can look at the backlog that we have, the reported backlog that's in the financials, as evidence that we have a growing amount of revenue to serve. So, in other words, we've got a high level of visibility. We had strong bookings in the fourth quarter in aggregate. So, yes, the e-Builder and Viewpoint businesses, those continue to grow ARR in the mid-teens. And I'll say, bookings were -- grew faster than that. So the bookings are the forward indicator to the revenue that will eventually be recognized. Now the other catalyst on top of that, Jerry, is that structures business that we talked about were -- that's the Tekla Structures business that made the model conversion in 2021 that will be part of that growth in 2022. Yes, we do anticipate some increase in transportation, but this projection that David made is not entirely dependent on it. In fact we have rather modest expectations on transportation. So to the extent that that is a lot better that could be a little potential upside for us. So, we are squarely focused on growing the recurring revenue, the digital transformation investments we're making, David talked about that, almost 100 bps of investment we make into that. That's the correlation to make to the ARR growth. It is an enabler of that ARR growth and we're absolutely committed to these transformation investments in order to drive these attractive revenue streams. I'd be careful about extrapolating from SketchUp to all the other businesses. Certainly, the SketchUp story is an amazing one. It really is sort of great flagship example of how changing the business model expands the addressable market on SketchUp. It has a quasi-consumer appeal, which Tekla would not. It's a very sophisticated product. So we're early days in the model conversion on Tekla. I don't think you'll see the expansion in the addressable market in that offering that we've had in SketchUp. In context of Connect & Scale, I think about two dynamics. One -- actually, I think three dynamics. One is our own organic progression and we -- the second is acquisition and the third is partnership. From our own organic progression, we believe we have an immense opportunity just to mine the data and the customer opportunities within -- I'll say, within the house. In other words, the cross-sell and the up-sell within the Trimble portfolio as evidence of that is our Trimble Construction One launch where we're creating persona-based bundles to go after the construction industry to better serve those customers. So, that's our primary use I'll say of capital allocation. Second, from an acquisition standpoint, we're definitely open to acquisition, not for the sake of acquisition if it helps accelerate the strategy. And so the two vectors we tend to look at on acquisitions are: one, product capabilities; and two, geographic reach. Sometimes, those are the same and sometimes, they're mutually exclusive. The majority of acquisitions we've done over time have looked more like a tuck-in than transformative and large ones. We've tended to do the larger ones every few years. And I wouldn't say that's by design. It's been more by availability. So we are certainly open to that. There's a bit of a bifurcation in the market where there's the really, I'll say, almost mega caps, at least mega cap defined in a Trimble context, and then the long tail of small companies. There's not too many in the middle. So, there's a bit of a scarcity of assets. So, we're absolutely open to it. We obviously have the balance sheet and we think we've got the right strategy. So if the fit is there we will pursue. On the partnership angle, I mentioned that because in a platform strategy, which is what connected scale is, we believe that partnerships are more important than ever to build out that ecosystem. We have a long track record of partnerships. We've got a joint venture with Caterpillar in civil construction; we've got a joint venture with Hilti in building construction; we've got a joint venture with Nikon in our survey and mapping business. We announced that relationship with Microsoft, a few months ago. We think that that is an important partnership to help us extend the reach and the capabilities of what we do. And as we open up, our technology to third parties and those ecosystems to help us extend that I think that's another point of evidence, of where our partnerships will come into play. And then I'd like to believe, that those partnerships which could also come through a Trimble Ventures arm could become acquisition candidates down the road. Yes, I think that's a fair way to think about it. I -- the words I tend to use internally are strategy structure systems. I believe an organizational structure follows the strategy and I believe the underlying systems are meant to be enablers of that structure and ultimately the strategy. So in the strategy of Connect & Scale, we see an enormous opportunity around the infrastructure bill since I think that's what you were asking about, when you said infrastructure. You may have meant our internal infrastructure. But if we're talking the IAJA, we see a large opportunity there that connects to the acquisition of AgileAssets to bring more aspects of Trimble together to positively impact the opportunity inside of construction. So within that strategy, then we organized ourselves. Well, sorry, actually also on the strategy side, yes that captures product and go-to-market. So I totally agree with you there. You've got to have -- and the product looks like the Suite, the collections of our technology and the go-to-market for us has as you look in the totality of Trimble has a hybrid aspect of direct and indirect that comes together. Okay. Then on the organizational structure side, we organize ourselves around the industries that we serve. So we have an industry leader for civil construction, for building construction, for agriculture, for survey and mapping for transportation. So we have that single point of accountability, to those end markets that we're serving. And then the underlying systems that captures some of the digital transformation systems work that we are doing, to give us that ability to better serve customers and to help us scale efficiently and effectively. You're welcome. Yeah. I'll give you the strategy setup and David can fill in the blanks on the numbers. So platform-as-a-service, that's the I'll say the branding name we've had on the machine control and guidance business in civil. In other words, think about taking that guidance business as a ratable offering that combines hardware and software. The fundamental value proposition to the customer is that of technology assurance, being able to stay on the latest version of sensors, or software, gives them ability to better connect to the office-based solutions we have and the connectivity solutions we have, to really round trip the data to and from the field to connect that physical/digital, to connect the office/field, connect the hardware and the software. So that's the reason and the value proposition that we pursue this. So let's take a guidance system and let's just use round numbers and say it's a $30,000 system today that a customer buys. In that system, you're buying a set of sensors, hardware and embedded software. The embedded software is actually what drives a lot of and creates a lot of that value. It's the enabling aspect of it today. Now today, the way the accounting works is we would take in that $30,000 example, we would take all of that revenue today. The way the accounting works is that the value is attributed partially to software, perpetual software and -- so that embedded software attributed to perpetual software and then the rest to hardware. So that's where David refers to it as a bundle. So what we see is that more and more of the value comes through the software aspect of the offering. And so that software aspect of the offering, so the portion of that $30,000 that's attributed to software that's what we look to take -- that's one of the things we look to take ratable over time. And that's a global offering that we just announced. Now in the US, we've been doing the whole thing as a ratable service. The accounting makes you take the hardware upfront even though it's ratable. And it's that software that you can take over time. And this global offering that we now have, that's the primary offering buy the hardware upfront and then the software becomes ratable. So in the short term, I think that's a hit to margin just like you would have in any software business that moves from perpetual to ratable. What we need to then be able to demonstrate through the numbers and it probably shows up as a term license and therefore in the ARR number is that we can show that ARR growth and link that to any offset in the margin. Now that's the short term. As you build the cumulative base, your margins slip and then you actually, as we know get back to parity and then have the value expansion opportunity from there, just on the base offering and that's before we talk about the upsell and the linkage to the rest of what we do. Dave, would you add anything? Thank you everyone for joining us on the call. And we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 4. Fourth quarter revenue was $926 million, up 12% versus a year ago. Organic revenue growth was 14%. Our strong revenue in the quarter was enabled by the outstanding performance of our supply chain and operations team as hardware revenue grew by over 20% versus the fourth quarter of last year, notwithstanding the extraordinarily difficult supply chain environment. Backlog of unfilled hardware orders grew in the quarter, reflecting both the strong demand in our end markets and customers placing orders earlier than they would have in the past. Hardware backlog at the end of fourth quarter was nearly four times the level of a year ago before the supply chain challenges emerged. With this strong backlog, we have unprecedented visibility into demand for our hardware offerings going into 2022. ARR grew at an organic rate of 12% driven by business model conversions, strong bookings and healthy customer retention for recurring solutions in the quarter. Gross margins were 57.8%, down 90 basis points sequentially from third quarter levels and down 160 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020. Gross margins were impacted by the mix of hardware revenue, higher inbound freight costs and our aggressive purchases of components in the broker market to support strong demand. Cost inflation was higher than our expectations and the price increases we took in our hardware offerings did not fully offset an unexpectedly sharp spike in cost inflation in the quarter. The price increases we have taken so far this year, averaging approximately 5% at the list price level across most of our hardware businesses and accompanied by reduced discounting have been accepted in the market. Given our leading position in the markets we serve, we are confident in our ability to maintain attractive margins. And we continue to adopt our pricing strategy to the cost outlook. Our EBITDA margin for the quarter was 24.1%, while operating income margins were 22.1%. As we expected, margins in the quarter were lower than the fourth quarter of 2020, but higher than Q4 of 2019. EPS was $0.62. We generated cash flow from operations of $155 million and free cash flow of over $140 million. Cash flow was lower than Q4 of 2020, driven by increased component inventory purchases. Turning now to slide 5, let's step back and review performance for the full year 2021. In the face of unprecedented challenges coming from the ongoing COVID disruptions supply chain shortages and accelerating inflation we achieved record results across a broad range of financial metrics. Revenue grew 16% to a record $3.66 billion and the ARR growth improved sequentially. While gross margins were down modestly, due to both inflation and the higher growth of our hardware revenues, EBITDA and operating margins ended the year above the levels of 2020 and at record levels in Trimble's history. Earnings per share were $2.66 up 19% versus a year ago. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow grew 12% and 14% respectively. Now on slide 6, from a geographic perspective revenues were up in all regions with the highest growth rate in Europe. North America revenue in the quarter also grew at a double-digit rate. Turning now to other key operating metrics on slide 7, I'll note that backlog ended the year at $1.8 billion. This is up from $1.3 billion a year ago. While backlog and our recurring offerings continued to grow, the majority of this increase came from hardware. And year-end hardware backlog exceeded our expectations of a quarter ago. Our results for 2021 reflect the achievement of a meaningful milestone. On a trailing 12-month basis our software services and recurring revenue exceeded $2 billion for the first time. Operating cash flow of over $750 million was also a record and exceeded 1.1 times non-GAAP net income. Turning now to our results by segment on slide 8, revenue was at or above our expectations in all segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue grew 14% versus prior year and 16% organically. Growth was strong across both hardware and software. Our sales of machine control solutions to civil construction customers grew by nearly 30% this quarter, despite supply chain constraints. ARR growth in the segment was strong with Viewpoint and e-Builder ARR together up at a mid-teens growth rate. SketchUp ARR growth was nearly 40%, while ARR gained momentum in our structures and MEP software businesses as they accelerated their transitions to recurring revenue models in the quarter. We ended the quarter with strong bookings momentum across our B&I Software businesses. Segment margins in the quarter were over 30%, representing a record fourth quarter for the segment despite cost inflation and the higher growth of hardware revenues. In B&I our price increases more than offset the hardware cost inflation, we saw in the quarter. Geospatial segment revenue increased 15% overall and 16% on an organic basis. Demand for our core survey and mapping portfolio remains very strong across all regions driven by strong spending in residential construction, civil infrastructure and utilities. Segment revenues also benefited from shipments against several large government contracts. Operating margins were below the levels of fourth quarter 2020 and the third quarter of 2021, driven principally by a short-term mix shift. The cost inflation we experienced in this segment was largely but not entirely offset by our 5% price increase and lower discounting. Resources and Utilities revenue grew 18% in total and 21% organically. Hardware backlog grew in R&U, reflective of very strong demand across the agriculture sector. The outlook for capital investment in ag remained strong driven by high crop prices, low inventories and high average equipment age. Segment margins were below those of a year ago and sequentially below third quarter levels. Product cost inflation was particularly high in this segment, as the cost of many critical components in our ag product offerings increased substantially in the quarter. In this segment our price increases have not yet kept up with inflation and we continue to refine our pricing strategy going forward. We anticipate operating margins in this segment in the coming year to rebound from the fourth quarter 2021 levels, as our price realization and mix improve. Consistent with our expectation coming into Q4, revenues and margins in our transportation segment were adversely impacted by supply chain challenges, both within our business and at our OEM customers. On the cost side, we experienced meaningful component inflation and high freight costs and we incurred costs related to realigning our product portfolio, toward available components. Slow production levels at our OEM customers also constrained our revenue of both hardware and recurring services in the quarter. The leading indicators from our transportation business continue to give us confidence that we are on the path to better ARR and margin trends, once the dynamics of the supply chain improve. We grew bookings year-on-year once again in Q4 and our net retention is at 100%. Our OEM customers are seeing stabilization in their own supply chain situation and we expect that orders from them will pick up early this year. Finally, on the cost side, we are introducing new products, which will support improved gross margins. For all these reasons, we project improved performance across the Transportation segment and ARR revenue and margins in the back half of 2022. Turning now to slide nine, I'd like to provide our financial outlook for 2022. We expect to see continued topline momentum. Demand from our end markets remain strong and so far, we haven't seen any signs of deceleration as a result of recent inflation and higher interest rates. Our backlog and forward-looking indicators of sentiment give us confidence in our prospects for ARR and revenue growth. As Rob and I have mentioned, we expect that supply chain disruptions will continue to be with us through 2022. There are signs that the pressure on component availability will abate in the back half of the year, but our plans presume that the supply chain will not be fully restored to equilibrium until 2023. With those factors in mind, we are initiating annual guidance for 2022. Excluding the impact of any additional acquisitions or divestitures, we project full year revenue of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, representing a range of growth outlooks of 8% to 11%. Our continuing transition of software offerings will present approximately 100 basis points of headwind to revenue growth. Organic ARR growth is expected to accelerate through the year to a mid-teens rate by year-end. We expect gross margins in 2022 to be comparable to or slightly better than 2021, with sequential improvement in the back half of the year. We expect that operating margins for the full year will be approximately 23%. Note that operating margins will be adversely impacted by the aforementioned subscription transitions, as well as investments we are making in support of our strategy and the acceleration of ARR. In aggregate, these factors present a headwind to operating margins of approximately 200 basis points. Income from equity investments is projected to be approximately $30 million, lower than 2021 due to higher product costs in our joint ventures. Net interest expense is forecast to be approximately $65 million and we project that our tax rate will be approximately 18%. Netting all this out, we project to achieve EPS in the range of $2.75 to $2.95. From a cash flow perspective, we project the free cash flow will once again exceed our non-GAAP net income. Our cash flow trends will be helped by the projected return toward equilibrium in the supply chain, as we anticipate needing lower component inventories by the end of the year. While we are focusing our guidance on expectations for the full year, I'd like to provide some color on the factors we expect to drive quarterly trends in 2022. Many of the normal seasonal patterns in our business are being disrupted by the impact of the constrained supply chain, so it is most helpful to think in terms of the expected sequential development from where we ended Q4 of 2021. We expect revenue to grow sequentially through each quarter of the year with ARR accelerating as well. From a product cost perspective, we expect to see inflation through the first half of 2022, similar to what we experienced in Q4 of 2021, with meaningful improvement in the second half. As a result, gross margins are likely to be relatively flat with Q4 of 2021 through the first half of the year and meaningfully higher in the second half. We expect that operating margins in the second half of the year will exceed the first half by approximately 150 basis points. I'll close by noting that we are planning an Investor Day in Colorado this September. And with that I'll turn it back over to Rob. Hi, Chad. This is David Barnes. I think the low end is 8% revenue growth. And I think your math is right there's some pricing in there. I'll note that the revenue growth will be impacted by about 100 basis points of transition, from perpetual to recurring some of our software businesses. We do expect hardware growth to moderate versus what we've seen this year. We'll be working through the backlog, but those are some of the big building blocks. Sure. The big -- if there's a change and there is a bit of a change it's that we're going to see more inflation than we had anticipated in the first half of 2022. Our outlook was a little more optimistic on that front. It's now clear that the supply chain being choked up, is going to last at least at some level through the end of next year. And we don't think the inflation scenario, in terms of our product costs will get meaningfully better. The guidance presumes sort of plateauing at Q4 levels. We do expect to see some price realization. I talked in the prepared remarks about margins in Ag. The sort of bad news of a lot of backlog is when you implement another price increase, you don't see it in revenue, right away. So those are the principal factors that would have operating leverage lower than we had indicated earlier. But I will point out that the deliberate decisions we're making in terms of model transition from perpetual to recurring, and then the investments against our strategic initiatives, each of those takes 100 basis points or so out of margins that we would have next year, if we weren't doing those things and that would generate very healthy operating leverage. Yeah. Hey, Rob. I'll say that the supply chain challenges you hear a lot of talk about semiconductors, but the issues are broader than that. With regard to electronics, I would say things are already improving. Part of that is that we several months ago took a number of steps including raising our outlook and making commitments with vendors placing orders that actually impacted our cash flow. We've worked component by component. We've seen meaningful progress. We're actually seeing visibility to capacity on some of our individual constrained parts with specific vendors. So that's getting better. And the fruits of our effort to redesign our products around very scarce components all of those show signs of improvements. Actually, where things are stickiest now is the non-electronics. It's cables, it's brackets, it's other kinds of parts. And that is sort of the downstream impact of labor disruptions in many markets all around the world. So that probably has a longer fuse to it. But you put all that together, that adds up to the outlook we described in the prepared remarks, which is yeah, we'll see inflation in constrained overall supply through the first half of the year and we'll see meaningful improvement albeit not all the way back to normal by year-end. Sure. There are many components. Looking at inflation, I think you can group it in a few buckets. There's the underlying just price increases from the suppliers and from our freight providers. And then there's expedited freight, where you use air freight instead of seaborne freight for instance. And then there's buying components in the broker market. And when you buy components in the broker market, the price can be not a few percent higher, but multiples higher than the normal purchase price. So the outlook for improved margins in the back half of the year is that we have a lot less of the use of the broker market. We have less expedited freight. We do think though that there will be underlying inflation that will be with us. But you'll see the full impact of the price increases including the ones we haven't taken yet or where we've taken them, they haven't flown through the backlog. And then over time, the mix of our business will improve. I'll point out that our revenues were up about 12% in the quarter and our hardware revenues in Q4 were up 20%. So that's not helpful to margin. And all those -- that will abate as well. So we add all that up, we think that's how we get to meaningfully better margins in the second half than the first half. Sure. I'll defer the longer-term question to Rob. With regard to margins Tami, there's a story both of mix and of higher input costs. There are a number of key components in our displays for guidance in agriculture where the supply was particularly tight. I mentioned a moment ago that when the markets are tight we and other providers of hardware technology have to go to the broker market to fill the needs. And in some cases a part that would normally cost $3 costs $30 or $40. So it's easy to see really dramatic cost spikes that happened disproportionately in this segment. So we've taken pricing actions. But in this particular segment the cost increases are meaningfully higher. So we're relooking at our pricing strategy and we're going to have to take some actions to improve our margins going forward. We do think there's partly a story of mix here and what we were shipping in Q4 is disproportionately on the lower end of the margin scale. So it will get better. But no doubt we have a margin challenge to wrestle with in this segment. And Rob you want to talk about the longer-term outlook? Sure, Gal. It's David. I'll look both a little bit backward and forward. So for the full year, the measurement we do indicates that the transition impact in 2021 was about 100 basis points negative impact to revenue. That's actually less than we thought going into the year. And the reason, it's less is that we had higher last-time buys of perpetual offerings in our structural design business. So right now, the impact the vast majority of the impact the 100 basis points whether it's for full year 2021, or full year 2022 are in our building software businesses. There's a decent chunk in the transportation business as well. Actually, we're going to see a piece of it in the civil software \u2013 civil construction software business, as we roll out our platform-as-a-service model. So you asked about the longer outlook. I'll tell you that the \u2013 if you look at our perpetual software revenue just under $500 million for 2021, we're already at a point where 70% or 75% of that perpetual software is sold bundled with hardware. So the straight software offerings are only 25% of it, by which I mean to say, we will at the end of 2022 be through the significant majority of the model transitions on the straight software businesses. But we are looking to transform to recurring revenue models the platform-as-a-service where \u2013 that's where we're moving, and we'll have some meaningful revenue in civil construction this year. We also have bundled perpetual software with hardware in the surveying business and in Ag, and that will be further out. So it's a little early to call on, how long that transition will take. Actually that's a topic we plan to cover off at our investor conference in September. But that's less straightforward to transition than a traditional software business. You've got -- you're bundled with hardware, you've got multiple regions and dealers. And so it's a harder problem to solve. It's likely to take several years. Yes. So I think I'm following you Gal. The margins are really high on both perpetual software and recurring. The difference is that when you sell subscription, you recognize the revenue and margin over many years rather than upfront. So I think our math is good that the conversions we're doing reduce revenue versus if you'd stayed in the perpetual model by the numbers we're saying and it essentially all goes through to the bottom line. Yes. Rob got it right, Jerry. We're at or close to mid-teens in the ARR growth of our businesses other than transportation. We're much lower than that in transportation. And we do project a recovery. We don't think we'll get all the way to numbers we think are good long-term by the end of the year, but the outlook presumes that we maintain and put some momentum across the businesses that are growing well now outside transportation and the transportation begins meaningful growth. So you put all that together, we get to mid-teens. And if we do even more than that then we'll be on the high end of our outlook. But that's how we get there. No, I think you nailed it, Rob. So even when you sell a bundle of hardware and software and solutions together, just the way the accounting works, is you figure out how much of the value is hardware and you do recognize that upfront. I think what's -- but the mega trend going on here that's in the context of the model transition, as Rob said is more and more of the value is with the software and solutions and relatively less of the hardware. So the impact on the P&L of the transition whereas today, historically the way we do it we recognize all the hardware and all the software and solutions upfront. As we go ratable on the software and the services, that will have a similar impact that it does on all of our other software businesses. So it will -- what you'll see in the accounting is the hardware still stays upfront, although hardware makes up less and less of the value of the old solution. And then when you go ratable on the solution, then the software part gets spread out overtime. Yeah. So I'll ground it in the -- my comments and the notion that the supply chain won't get back to equilibrium even by the end of 2022. So just round numbers hardware backlog in a normal world is $100 million. We're at nearly four times that somewhere around $375 million. We're likely to get halfway back or more than halfway back, but still be well above the 100 level. As a general trend, it's unlikely that we'll see hardware revenue outstrip total revenue like we did in the fourth quarter. The other book end, I'll put it that obviously our transportation revenue trends have been more modest than the other segments, and we do expect in the second half of the year an uplift in transportation. But the rest of the businesses are actually quite similar in the sense that demand is very strong backlog is big. Just by the numbers Geospatial of these segments is most hardware related. So we've just had extraordinary growth. And it's -- we're outgrowing by everything we can measure the market in those solutions. So you're likely to see that segment slow more than the others, but we have a really big backlog in construction and agriculture. And yes, so I think you'll see lowest growth in transportation particularly in the first half. Geospatial, just because its hardware dependent will be lower and the other segments will be -- we expect to be very strong. I think the math is probably pretty easy, if we end up near where we were in Q4 for the first two quarters. And then we'll end the year at or maybe modestly above full year 2021. That will -- I think that gets you there. It will be -- the modeling of that won't get you to 60%, but it will get you closer than the 58% where we are now. So ..."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Trimble Third Quarter 2021 results. At this time, all participants\u2019 lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  To ask a question during the session, [Operator's Instruction]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator's Instruction]. I would now like to head call over to your speaker today, Mr. Rob Baker, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nRob Painter: Welcome everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page two with the key messages we want to convey today. In the Third Quarter, our team once again delivered outstanding results and did so within an incredibly difficult supply-chain environment.  We exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of 1.36 billion up 8% year-over-year, and up 11% on an organic basis. Total revenue growth of EBITDA margin of 25.9%, and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $784 million. We achieved record third quarter levels of revenue in many of our businesses.  With another exceptionally strong quarter in machine control and civil construction, guidance in agriculture and Survey and Mapping. For results demonstrate the strength of the underlying market recovery and the quality of our execution against our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. Our results also demonstrate the quality of the Trimble team.  And I want to give a special shout-out to all our colleagues, led by Leah Lamberton, who are helping us manage through the supply chain challenges on the basis of this collective strength, we are raising our annual earnings guidance despite a tightening supply chain environment. With start with market conditions where the overall land scape remains robust.  Construction backlog is healthy, especially in residential and infrastructure, translating to strengthen in our Geospatial and buildings and infrastructure reporting segments. We remain optimistic that the Infrastructure Bill will ultimately be passed in the U.S., which would bolster our long-term outlook in our construction and surveying businesses, starting at some point in 2023.  We have been and are building product and go-to-market capabilities ahead of this opportunity. I'm especially proud of the role Trimble has played in leading policy advocacy in support of technology adoption, most specifically around advanced digital construction management systems, which provides State Departments of Transportation, with access to funding, to help them accelerate adoption of proven digital design and construction technologies.  We will continue our commitment and support to the nation's Federal Highway Administration and State Departments of Transportation and their pursuit of achieving sustainable and state-of-the-art project delivery. In Agriculture and Forestry, commodity price strength continues to translate into customer buying power and our backlog remains strong.  We are tracking inventory levels of major Ag products which remain in a healthy position and provide some line of sight to continue d farm financial strength. Which we see as an important counterbalance to rising input. Costs on the policy front, we have been advocating for legislate legislative proposal called SB27 -50, Precision Agriculture loan program act in the U.S. that provides low cost loans to farmers to incentivize adoption of precision technologies.  Outside the U.S., we also see positive conditions including ongoing subsidies. And we are beginning to see more policies that promote the use of technology to increase environmental sustainability in transportation, we had another quarter of solid bookings growth, improved customer retention, and higher operating margins.  In September, we announced a strategic relationship with Procter & Gamble, which will shape the development of an agile procurement collaboration platform and will in turn complement our existing set of supply chain focus solutions. Success looks like expediting contracting and onboarding processes to increase the velocity of business transactions while enabling more efficient movement of freight.  I'm also pleased to report that we were the first major technology provider to certify in Canada for the Canadian ELD mandate, evidence of the positive shift in product delivery in the business. On the downside, supply chain is especially disruptive to the operations of many of our trucking customers and will likely constrain our ability to see our execution progression flow through the near term P&L.  Let's turn to Page 3 and talk some about some notable progression of our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy seen through the lens of the Trimble Operating System, capturing strategy people into execution. To set context, our strategy is an industry Platform strategy that manifest and bringing the best of Trimble together with Eco. The system partners to transform industries that support how we live, what we eat, and how we move.  On the heels of cop 26, we're also convinced that we can have a profoundly positive impact on addressing climate change through the use of technology. As approved point of our strategy, we are excited to have announced on October 27th the formation of a strategic partnership with Microsoft to build market and sell our industry Cloud platforms and solutions that connect people, technology, tasks, data, processes, and industry life cycles.  Our initial focus will be to build a Trimble Construction Cloud powered by Microsoft Azure. Importantly, we will also partner on joint go-to-market strategies to globally delivered these cloud innovations. As an additional strategic proof point, at our annual user conference for viewpoint construction management software business, we announced the transition of viewpoints branding to Trimble.  At this user conference, we also launched Trimble Construction 1, as shown on page four. Which extends the capabilities of viewpoints, current SaaS software suite with new and exciting capabilities from other parts of the Trimble Software portfolio.  In addition to the viewpoint financial and operational management capabilities, Trimble Construction One incorporates Trimble's estimating and detailing solutions, as well as Trimble's advanced project management offering, in a single integrated package, which is now being sold by multiple Trimble divisions.  Our direction is clear. We will continue to expand the capabilities of the Trimble Construction One platform for our civil and buildings customers to further connect the physical and digital worlds across construction field and office workflows. On people, we continue to be recognized as a top Company culture and Fast Company recognized us as a best workplace for innovators.  In an increasingly competitive job market, melding Trimble's mission with our innovative culture, is top-of-mind for our talent attraction and retention efforts. As evidence of the attractiveness of Trimble, in September we hired Jennifer Len as Chief Platform Officer and Poppy Crum as our Chief Technology Officer. Both world-class talent who see and believe in our vision and the potential of Trimble.  On execution, we continue to innovate. Our MX50 Mobile Scanner launched in the third quarter, [Indiscernible] a beta release of SketchUp for iPad. And we continue to enhance the capabilities of our best-in-class high-accuracy correction services, which enable positioning down to centimeter levels globally.  We are investing heavily in our own digital transformation, which will provide the system and process fuel to deliver our increasingly connected solutions in an efficient and scalable way. Before I turn the call over to David, I want to talk about how we are operating and leading in the current environment, which presents both volatility and unprecedented opportunity. For years, we have talked about our 3-4-3 operating model.  3 months, 4 quarters, 3 years. I see the role of Trimble leadership as being stewards of capital allocation on behalf of our shareholders, where we balance short-term realities with long-term possibility. As we move towards closing out 2021 and end to 2022, we will continue to support the incremental investments we are putting towards our digital transformation, autonomy, and infrastructure opportunities.  We have high conviction that these investments will create new, sustainable, and differentiated long-term growth opportunities Trimble. And we remain bullish on the long-term secular opportunity for digital technology to make our customers more successful, productive and sustainable. We will have the courage to look through near-term supply chain disruptions in upfront cost of our digital transformation. And to hold ourselves accountable to progressing our Connect & Scale strategy. David, overview.\nDavid Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $9101 million up 14% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 1% in divestitures subtracted 2% for a total organic revenue increase of 15%. Gross margin in the third quarter was 58.7% down 10 basis points year-over-year, reflecting several factors including higher product and freight costs in our supply chain, offset by increased pricing and lower discounting.\nRob Painter: Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.9% down 90 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher operating expenses and investments in the business. Operating margin was 23.8% down 40 basis points year-over-year, but still up over 300 basis points versus the pre-COVID third quarter of 2019. Operating expenses last year were unusually low in a number of areas, including compensation expense.  Net income dollars increased by 10% and earnings per share increased by $0.06 to $0.66 per share. Our third quarter cash flow from operations was a 166 million and free cash flow was a 156 million. Cash flow was down modestly year-over-year in the quarter. As we are purchasing inventory in response to strong demand and supply chain shortages.  Operating cash flow is up 23% on a year-to-date basis, with a conversion ratio to net income above 1.1 times. Our net debt declined 88 million in the quarter, and our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 0.9 times. During the third quarter we repurchased a $100 million of common stock.\nDavid Barnes: At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available in our revolving credit facility and approximately $513 million in cash. Our balance sheet is strong and we are well-positioned to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. Turning now to Slide 6, I will review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends.  As mentioned earlier our ARR was up 8% in aggregate and was up 11% organically on a year-over-year basis. The 11% rate excludes the impact of foreign exchange and our recent divestitures of IRON Solutions, Manhattan Real Estate Solutions, and Construction Logistics. All three of these divested businesses had a recurring revenue component, but we're in areas outside of our strategic roadmap. Our non-recurring revenue streams grew with hardware up 18%\nRob Painter: Year-over-year and perpetual software growing 19%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction Geospatial and Agriculture. Our hardware growth contributed to perpetual software growth. As some of our hardware offerings are. Bundled with perpetual software. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 11% in Europe, revenues were up 18%.  Asia-Pacific was up 5% year-over-year and the rest of the world was up 33%, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector in Brazil. Next on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics we follow, and I'll start with ARR. While total Company ARR grew 11% organically on a year-over-year basis, ARR excluding transportation, grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter.  Networking capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, continued to be negative, representing approximately -2% of revenue on a trailing 12 month basis. Notwithstanding an acceleration in purchases of component inventory during Q3. Research and development on a trailing 12 month basis was 15% of revenue, and our deferred revenue grew 17% year-over-year.  Our backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion up from $1.5 billion a quarter earlier, and up over 30% year-over-year. While growth on our backlog is an indicator of momentum in the business, it is also reflective of the shortages and extended delivery times that we are experiencing for many key components in our hardware products.  Of our 1.6 billion in backlog, just under $340 million relates to our hardware offerings, up from about a $100 million in hardware backlog a year ago, and $38 million higher than the end of Q2. We expect supply chain constraints for many key components to extend well into\nDavid Barnes: 2022. Let's turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 12% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our building and civil Construction businesses and organic ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter.  Geospatial revenue was up 23% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment\u2019s. Margins were up 60 basis points due to both revenue growth and operating costs control. Resources and utilities revenue was up 23% on an organic basis. We experienced double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture and positioning services offerings.  Margins in resources and utilities contracted 330 basis points and were hardest hit by product cost inflation in the quarter. Financial results in transportation show ed progression in a number of areas. Revenue was up 3% on an organic basis year-over-year, but grew less than we expected due to supply chain challenges, both in our operations and our customers' businesses.  Margins expanded 410 basis points year-over-year. Turning now to Page 9 for our updated outlook for the full year. We are raising our expectation for full-year revenue with a new range of $3.59 billion to $3.64 billion, representing growth for the full year in the mid-teens and single-digit year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. End market demand is even stronger than we thought it would be a quarter ago.  But supply chain constraints will likely cause our backlog to remain at or above the increased levels from the end of Q3. Air or growth at the Company level is trending as we anticipated, driven by strong bookings and subscription transition. And we expect organic [Indiscernible] growth of greater than 10% in the fourth quarter and a strong entry point going into 2022.  Gross margins in the fourth quarter are likely to be about flat sequentially with the third quarter. An increasing mix of software will have a favorable impact on sequential gross margin trends. But this benefit will be offset by an anticipated decline in hardware margins. In aggregate, we now expect that the net impact of accelerating hardware cost inflation, and our recent price increases will be modestly negative to hardware margins in Q4.  Building off our strong third quarter results, our outlook for operating margins continues to improve, and we now expect operating margins for the full-year 2021 will be above 2020. Operating margins in the fourth quarter of this year will likely be lower than the fourth quarter of 2020, driven both by higher hardware component costs year-on-year, and by higher operating expense as OpEx was unusually low in 2020, and we're now ramping up investments against our strategy.  Our outlook for full-year earnings per share, has increased to $2.61 to $2.69, representing growth of approximately 17 to 21% year-over-year. We continue to expect operating cash flow greater than 1.1 times net income and free cash flow greater than 1 times net income, reflecting the strong cash-generated aspects of our business model. I'd like to comment briefly on the outlook and fourth quarter for our transportation segment.  As Rob (ph) mentioned earlier, the leading indicators for this business are strong with growing bookings of recurring solutions, sequentially improving customer retention in our mobility business, an increasing sign that are connected transportation strategy is resonating with customers.  Nevertheless, factors related to the global supply chain and the extraordinary pressure on the transportation industry will negatively impact our business momentum in the short run. Our OEM business will be constrained by customer manufacturing challenges. And the aftermarket business will be slowed by the fact the trucking companies are reluctant to take assets off the road for technology upgrades, at a time of high transportation prices and extraordinary asset utilization.  We believe that these constraints will be resolved over time and we remain confident in the turnaround of this business. But the pace of improvement of revenue, ARR and profitability will be lower than we had earlier projected. With regard to 2022, we don't plan to give detailed guidance until our year-end earnings release, but we can characterize some of the drivers that we see now.  And there is expected impact on revenue ARR and margins. Demand across our end markets remains strong and we believe that strength will sustain at least through the end of 2022. Our customers need for digital solutions to optimize their workflows has never been stronger and these customers have the money and the desire to invest.  We expect organic ARR growth to accelerate in 2022, building off the momentum we have now and aided by continued model transitions and the growing sale of connected recurring solutions. The supply chain environment remains our biggest challenge and that challenge is predicted to be with us for several more quarters.  From a cost perspective, we anticipate that inflation in our hardware businesses will be sustained through the first quarters of 2022, driven both by higher component costs and higher cost of getting products shipped to our manufacturers and distribution centers. It is the goal of our pricing strategy to offset the impact of inflation on our hardware gross margins, and that pricing strategy continues to evolve.  Rob referenced in his remarks, the investments we are making against our digital transformation. We anticipate that as we get through this investment cycle in 2022 and as our software businesses continue their transition to recurring revenue models, our operating leverage will be lower in 2022 than we expect over the longer term.  The investments we're making in our digital transformation are at the core of unlocking the potential of our platform strategy. And we expect to end 2022 with business processes and systems that will accelerate our ability to transform the way we go to market, and the way our customers do their work. With that, I will turn it over to the Operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator's Instructions] Your first question is from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAnn Duignan: Yes. Hi. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about the outlook for 2022 and what you see across the different segments. I know you said in some of your opening comments that you do expect an infrastructure built path. If that doesn't happen would that influence your outlook for 2022 at all for buildings and also Geospatial?  And then the [Indiscernible] in Agriculture which continue to see farmer sentiment decline on higher input costs, not just in the U.S, but also in Brazil. So maybe talk about some of the pluses and minuses that you're seeing out there as you look to 2022, and the end-markets. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Hi, and thanks for the questions. This is Rob. So I'll give you a walk around the end markets and some of the positives and some of the potential gotchas that we're looking out for. And the things we're looking out for that could be to the negative would be around supply chain inflation in labor availability and of course, all of those things correlate.  On the Geospatial and Construction side, we see strength in residential and infrastructure work right now we see on the commercial side strengthen sub-markets such as data centers and hospitals. We believe there\u2019s an indicator that the residential work will drive light industrial work as it relates to the infrastructure bill and if it doesn't pass, we would see a benefit of the infrastructure bill really in 2023. So we really don't expect anything in 2022.  Of course, there's a sentiment aspect that's hard to quantify, but are -- but we remain that optimistic and I spent some time in Washington a couple of weeks ago to that end. And when I think about construction and I think about the labor side of it as a potential downside. The benefit of technology is that it can make an inexperienced operator good.  Our Geospatial market or robotic total station can turned to person operation into a one person operation. On the Ag side, what's positive our commodity prices, it looks like the harvest -- early data on the harvest would suggest a lower harvest, which would hold up commodity prices and then the index that against the ending stocks or the inventory. As you said, absolutely input inflation, I think is what's starting to dent the optimism on the farmer front.  With that input inflation, though I look at the value proposition of the of the technology. So a spot spray technology can reduce the use of herbicide. And that's a really big deal, where the variable rate can reduce the use of the other inputs. And as we know, also has a positive environmental sustainability benefit.  At a Geographic level the subsidy policies tend to be more consistent and higher outside the U.S., so that tends to be -- provides a ballast, let's say to the overall market, but we're absolutely paying, attention to all of this at some point. This is -- we'll have to have an impact. On the transportation side, what we see is strength in spot pricing and I mean, we even seen it from our own rates on transportation as David talked about them, where they've gone up.  A downside is driver availability in the market and availability of trucks coming out of the OEMs so carriers are having trouble actually adding capacity. And when I think about a technology lens on that, an average driver effectively uses around 7 hours of their clock per day. Our strategy is to drive a more connected supply chain.  That means dynamic schedules with the shippers and the receivers to better optimize wasted driver hours. We provide better routing and navigation solutions to create efficient trip management. And fundamentally, we want to get at more accurate order [Indiscernible] load information for the customers. And that can increased the network optimization. So there's puts and takes as always, and we think that technology has a role really in almost any market condition.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDevin Au: Hi, this is actually Devin on for Jason, potentially taking my questions. First one I have on construction. Just wondering if you could provide an update on I guess, e-Builder and viewpoint. I know that you guys re-branded, but any color on EAR growth and growth drivers there would be helpful.\nRob Painter: Hi, thanks for the question. So the combined ARR growth between the 2 businesses was set up plus 17% year-over-year. So another great quarter of execution between the 2 businesses. As you noted with the rebranding, we are especially optimistic around the Trimble Construction One offering. We converted over a 1,000 customers to the Trimble Construction One offering.  Sold dozens of new logos onto the offering in the quarter and that -- bookings that creates ARR later down the road but the value proposition and the awareness from the customers is quite encouraging. And we've seen that in the bookings for some time now and which now plays through the ARR expansion.\nDevin Au: Great, that's helpful. And just one more, and staying on construction and you are definitely encourage to see the connected construction. On platform, but just want to ask are you -- in terms of like market opportunity, are you still mainly displacing these legacy systems that they were based processes out there or are you seeing meaningfully more interest from contractors and owners looking for a more connected solution?\nRob Painter: There are both. It's a good question. From a market -- overall market perspective, really the secular opportunity and construction technology, by the way, I would see this in our other end markets as well. Is that these markets are large. They're global, they're underserved, and they are underpenetrated by a technology.  So the move to digitization provides a value proposition that delivers productivity, quality, safety, efficiency, transparency, the environmental sustainability. So there's a positive catalyst for technology to be adopted. And at some level, yes, that is replacing paper-based systems. That exists or let\u2019s says just the mental based systems that exist.  And we are seeing demonstrable interest from customers in the connected solutions that we offer and I've had a chance to talk to a number of the customers personally, some that are shown us how they're already taking our technology and connecting the various solutions to improve their workflow. And one of the things they do is not only connect a Trimble workflow, but an Trimble environment that can provide actually accommodate environment.  We can connect in an open and really agnostic way to the other technology that our customers use. Customers operated as you know, in the construction industry is fragmented. Therefore, the technology tends to be a bit fragmented as well. And so our ability in approach to connect Trimble and non-Trimble solutions is very top-of-mind for customers.  And of course, COVID has also been a catalyst from a digitization perspective. So much of what we do, can uniquely connect the work in the office and the field that connects the hardware and the software and ultimately that physical and digital.\nDevin Au: Great, that\u2019s good to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rob Wertheimer of [Indiscernible]. Your line is now open.\nRob Wertheimer: Hi, thank you. And Rob, thanks for that answer. I actually would like to follow-up on a couple of points you were making there. Just on the future of digitalization [Indiscernible] construction, I wondered -- there's a very large opportunity. Do you feel like there is an acceleration? Is there a tipping point where we're visible in the next 2 or 3 years or X time frame where you have to be digital or you're not there?  Just a general sense on how fast that market is moving. And then do you think it's coalescing around 2 or 3 sort of platforms, yourselves being one of them. And that's kind of the Construction one idea or is that too aggressive statement? And it's still a hodgepodge of a bunch of different assets, maybe just asking you to assess the competitive platform dynamic as well. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Hi Rob and thanks for the question. From a tipping point perspective and an acceleration perspective, I think the numbers would prove the acceleration of the adoption of technology. And if we were to get an infrastructure bill, which by the way, we're talking about that in a U.S. context.  But we see a construction lead recovery really globally in many markets. And so HS2 is a really nice project in the U.K., [Indiscernible] and Paris. The rail project is expected to be a very large project, and there's large projects happening and Saudi and Australia continues to have some big development.  We see the fundamentals in the macro's providing ability to accelerate it. I think, really, the move to have the digitization, COVID I really do feel has accelerated that perhaps hasn't inflected so many of our customers were unable to actually go out to the field like they used to go to do or they realize the need to be Cloud connected in Cloud -enabled when they weren't going to their offices at frequent, as frequently.  And we think that's helped us drive more bookings in the business to the cloud offerings. And as it relates to a tipping point that's a really good question. That's a bit of a crystal ball. I think one of the catalysts that could create a tipping point, would be if we see more of this driven from owners. And I will say as well as regulators and maybe I really mean policy when I say that.  So from an owner perspective, that's actually the premise of why we did the e-Builder acquisition because who fundamentally has the most at stake when a project's late or over budget, of course it's the owner and so we help them manage their capital programs. From a policy and regulatory perspective, where we have a point of view as we the [Indiscernible] take that U.S. infrastructure bill as an example.  I mean this is a generational opportunity to increase the competitiveness of the united -- of the infrastructure in the U.S.. And we can deliver that infrastructure 20%, 30% cheaper through the use of technology. So it just makes sense.  And so, if more of this, if we can increase the level of awareness, I'm certainly an [Indiscernible] that there's a policy measure here are certainly encouragement measure, and that's why I talked about that digital construction Management Act because it provides an incentive for DOTs to adopt technology. I'd say we're all staying tuned for that one. There is something that's sort of fundamentally creates an acceleration on that -- on the tipping point part of it.  And then you asked about platforms, Rob. And on the platform side, I think it is logical to think that there would be some coalescing around a few platforms. I mean, as you said, the industry is rather fragmented. We're not the only technology platform out there actually. I think there needs to be interoperability between those technology platforms, and that very much shapes how we build our technology. It is an underlying fundamental belief that we have.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you.\nRob Painter: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jonathan Ho of William Blair. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to maybe start out with some of the supply chain issues. Can you talk a little bit about maybe what the increases in lead times look like for your customers and have you seen any potential losses given the extended backlog and potentially delivery times?\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Jonathan, it's David. The lead times vary a lot by product, but historically, our lead times have been very short measured in a few days. And there are many times that, so weeks and in some cases, many weeks or a few months, and that's the math of the backlog that you're seeing. As far as the competitive dynamics, in a very few isolated cases, we can identify where we've lost business to a competitor that can supply more quickly.  Typically they are competing at the lower end of the market and in some cases those customers have come back. But I think the generally our competitors are experiencing at least similar pressure to where we have and we don't believe that this has had an adverse impact on our share trends. In fact, in our hardware businesses where we can see numbers that are published by our peers or competitors.  There is evidence in many of those segments that we're gaining share. We also haven't seen a meaningful amount of orders being canceled because the lead times are extended. So it's something we're watchful for. We're lucky as Rob said in his comments, have a really capable of. Operations team that has done a remarkable job getting supply in this very difficult environment.\nJonathan Ho: Excellent. And then just as a follow-up, just given the strength in your Ag business, I'm wondering, are you seeing a change in the types of products that you're selling into that market, especially relative to historically when it was sort of focused on guidance systems? Are you seeing sort of that broader digital transformation happening in this segment as well? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Hey Jonathan. It's Rob, I'll take that one. I'd say the product mix is relatively stable at the moment. What I would say, we're doing a better job of is connecting the software and the hardware and the correction services into the offerings that we have some more of that bundling at a point-of-sale and making ourselves easier to do business with.  We have picked up some new OEM customers along the way, and then we've seen some strength in -- particular strength in various geographies. So in the quarter Brazil was very strong for us. Russia was also very strong for us. So there's, I'd say there's pockets, geographic pockets, where we're able to increase the penetration. In terms of a discernible shift in the overall mix of the portfolio. Not really at this point.\nJonathan Ho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Hi, good afternoon, and good evening. I was wondering, Rob, if would you mind expanding on the recurring bookings growth you folks outlined in your prepared remarks and transportation, I think it's the most positive tone you've [Indiscernible] transportation in a while. Can you just unpack that? What part of the business is driving the recurring growth and what do the churn rates look like on the legacy business where we're working through the headwinds. Thanks.\nRob Painter: Sure. Hi, Jerry thanks for the question. Within the transportation business, historically talked about 3 legs on the stool though the technology stack. The first being that we provide mapping, routing, navigation engines. Second, that we provide the back office technology for trucking companies. And third, that we provide the field mobility tools for companies. In terms of the booking and then those are the 3 historic legs of that stool.  And then over the last couple of years, we've moved as well to address the shipper side of the market whereas historically this strength is on the carrier side. On the carrier side of the business, where we see the bookings, growth is in a couple of places. So first in that [Indiscernible] ERP systems, we called it a Transportation Management System and we're moving that business to a recurring model. So there's a model conversion that's happening in there.  And we have seen evidence that we're increasing the size of the addressable market, which means we're reaching some customers that we hadn't previously reached. And that's translating into 20% plus bookings growth on a year over year basis in that part of the business.  What we're seeing as well on the mobility side, which is really more of the EOD part of the business. As we have seen, some life there, both through two things. 1,... increasing penetration and existing customers as some of our existing customers, actually many of them are adding capacity given the market.  In fact, they would like to add more capacity in many cases aren't able to actually get the vehicles are the drivers to do it, but that's one area where we see growth. And the others as we do see some logos are coming back to us, which has been a really good sign for us. Still a long way to go, but I'm liking what I'm seeing from the team, and the pace of the team, and the trajectory and that Canadian ELD certification was a nice proof point that we're not just talking about these things, that we are actually also are delivering.  That mapping, routing, navigation business has had many, many years of double-digit recurring revenue growth, which means bookings continue to grow strong and they continue to do a great job in quarter-in and in quarter-out. [Indiscernible] up and that got to the commentary on the script. You asked Jerry about the churn rate as well.\nJerry Revich: [Indiscernible]\nRob Painter: Yeah. On the churn rate side, I'd characterize it in net retention, and net retention was above 100% in the quarter, which is obviously a great sign for us.\nJerry Revich: It's really nice to hear about the inflection there and you know in buildings and infrastructure, I know you have really good visibility on the prospective pipeline and bookings. Can you talk about if you've seen an acceleration in those lead indicators that you track for e-Builder and viewpoint, given the labor shortages, etc. Could we actually see ARR accelerate further from the strong rate that we're running at in 3Q.\nRob Painter: So, yes, actually we do think we can accelerate the level of our growth actually across the Company. And then that being the biggest contributor really to that growth, it absolutely -- it's something that we have a line of -- reasonable line of sight to after the current bookings growth as we plan the business forward, we'll think about in any given quarter or a year for that matter, what's quote-on-quote in the bank and then what's the go-get when we think about that go-get than you can measure the pipeline you have and then you measure the qualified leads you have against that.  So you kind of just keep working backwards from that equation and then do you have the horsepower to go and possible effect the pipeline and to turn it into a booking which eventually turns into the revenue. In addition, Jerry another catalyst to rest coming into next year is, our structures business. So that will [Indiscernible] business, the steel concrete business, so that in the summer, we stopped selling perpetual licenses.  And so -- in fact, we sold more perpetual this year than we had anticipated and now that we're off the -- almost entirely off the perpetual, that just by the math will provide a catalyst for ARR our [Indiscernible] bookings, which will turn into ARR so that alone would be a catalyst to our ARR growth in that business looking into next year.\nJerry Revich: Thanks, Rob.\nRob Painter: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question is from Weston Twigg of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nWeston Twigg: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Actually I have 2, if you'll allow it. First, just the Geospatial segment has been growing really strongly. And I'm just wondering if you could help us just get a fuel for those trends through next year, how sustainable is this rate of growth?\nRob Painter: Hi, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. Big kudos to the Geospatial team. The latest innovation that went to market in the third quarter was the MX50 Mobile Mapping System. And that's on the heels just really many innovations over the last few quarters between the X7 Laser Scanner our [Indiscernible] receiver a really nice run for this. The business has I'd say a pretty good amount of backlog associated with it.  As we look forward into 2022, we think that we do have the [Indiscernible] at our backs and that we can continue to grow the business. Now the stunning growth that we've had in that business in 2022 or 2021, excuse me. No, I don't see that that wouldn't progress as we've said a few years ago, we -- that this was we think thought of it as our most mature of the businesses that we have and it has proved to more than once lately to be the -- one of the fastest growers within Trimble on a year-over-year basis, so really a lot of excellent innovation.  And as well, our go-to-market team has just done an outstanding job with the channel management around the world. And I would expect that to temper back somewhere closer into the Company average of the 6 to 9 organic range as we go into next year. I would take that as a starting point.\nWeston Twigg: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then the other question I had, you mentioned the cop 26 conference, the discussions around there, and with all the severe weather events this year and how this impacted your customers, I'm wondering if you could maybe discuss some of your broader revenue opportunities with respect to climate change adaptation. Specifically, thinking about some of your agricultural construction infrastructure customers. And maybe outweighing broadly speaking, how that revenue opportunity could ramp.\nRob Painter: Oh, thank you for that question. So I'm excited and I'm actually quite inspired by the ability Trimble to play a fundamentally positive impact, or a fundamentally positive role in impacting climate change. Now, the truth of the matter is that our products and our technology have had a positive environmental, sustainability benefit for as long as we have been around. I mean, it's been a byproduct of the productivity and efficiency that our customers generate.  What I see as an opportunity is that comes more and more to the forefront. In some cases, it's just our customers have more reporting to do themselves. Whether they realize it now, some of them do and or rather they don't, we see that coming and then we see an ability to go to move into that space. If you take Agriculture as an example, we do have a small business in Ag that essentially runs a carbon marketplace.  We get calls from customers or potential customers asking for help in certifying the offsets that they're buying. Think about our -- we tend to talk about our Agriculture business, but we also have a nice forestry business. These are two places that are hugely important in this conversation. And so as big companies are making their own commitments and buying offsets, they don't want to buy bad offsets.  And so we're encouraged by the types of calls that we're getting because it's giving us conviction of where we take our product road map to positively impact us. I mean, if I think about the construction space, our structures business, so the steel part of the structures business.  We did an announcement a couple of weeks ago of something that I think is pretty compelling as we can continue from a design perspective, essentially to design for sustainability, to understand the carbon load that a building has during that design and engineering phase. For many years, we've had a pre -design product to help you understand, let's say the energy consumption profile of a building.  And as the users of the buildings on let's say, if there becomes regulatory pressure on this, to design with carbon in mind, the constructible models that we provide at Trimble have a profoundly positive ability to impact designing and maintaining and operating with sustainability in mind. So we're actually putting some -- our resources to this.  Because I see, all of us at Trimble see or board sees some really interesting opportunities that at some point will turn into commercial opportunities. Now that they turn into commercial opportunities is something discrete and separate, or are they part of the existing technologies we have? I would see there I don't know. But you follow what's going on and you've got -- I've got to believe that there's some material business for us to have here.\nWeston Twigg: That's really helpful and thanks for all the effort in that category for sure. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chad Dillard of Bernstein. Your line is open.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good evening, guys.\nRob Painter: Hi.\nChad Dillard: I actually want to go back to Trimble Construction 1, I was hoping you can give a little bit more context on where it belongs in the prior portfolio. My first question is just on just how much overlap does it a have versus your current product offering and then maybe you could talk about at least like your initial sales, whether you're seeing more come from conversions versus new customers. And then secondly, it to extend to this new platform expand the opportunity to [Indiscernible].\nRob Painter: Chad, so this is Rob, I'll take the question. So where to start? Our Trimble Construction 1 offering, essentially right now can take what we do at viewpoint. I mean, at viewpoint, years ago, we moved from selling, I'll call it an ERP on an office - based solution to moving to selling a combined team and Field Solutions, so think, project management and field mobility tools. And we called it viewpoint one and then we caught an [Indiscernible] office team field offerings.  So it moved from a point solution to a bundled viewpoints solution and now that next step is and to Trimble Construction 1, what the first release of it. That brings in many aspects of our MEP business. So it's mechanical, electrical, plumbing business and we're able to bring in detail or an estimator workflows into the product offering.  And then from there, we have a basis where we can continue to expand across other architectural and engineering workflows and products that we have. So by and large, it's taking what we do already and having a better packaging around that. Making it easier for our customers to consume the technology.  From a technology perspective, it's better integration, tighter integration between the solutions that we have. Our customers have been asking for this, and so we're really excited to be able to start delivering upon it. I would say it's just the start. It's Version 1 of Trimble Construction 1. There are many other capabilities that we believe we can bring into that both from a civil perspective as well as a vertical construction perspective.  And the natures of the conversions we have thus far are predominantly with the existing customers and moving them over. But we did get a few dozen new logos during the quarter on Trimble Construction 1. It's very much a persona based growth platform. We think about personas and in architectural engineering work persona, we think about a contractor persona.  We think about an owner persona. And then we'll as we migrate over time will get -- be able to get more and more. I'll say specific and targeted to delivering Construction, Trimble Construction 1, to those individual persona.  So I'd really say the start of much more to come and the more that we connect the data, the users, and the workflow across this data be gets the opportunity to move into richer data, AI opportunities. And there it gets then another level of exciting so the more we can connect what we've got for our customers, the more of that will create solutions down the road.\nChad Dillard: Great, thanks for that. Second question, more so on your hardware business, just trying to understand the progression of price cost and maybe you can just walk us through what the price cost balance. It was 1Q, 2Q, 3Q.  I think you said for 4Q, it's negative and then I guess most importantly, where do we go from here for this year? If I remember correctly, there's a portion of your business that is under [Indiscernible] longer-term contracts and when do those anniversary up get up for a renegotiation.\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Chad, let me give you some perspective and all sort of ground. My comments in what we mentioned last time, when this very uncertain world we were estimating that for the full year 2021, we'd have inflation in aggregate of about 6% of our $600 million in COGS, so that's $36 million. We're definitely running north of that. We're probably about $10 million more in product and freight inflation than we were anticipating.  And we've adopted our pricing strategy all year in response to our best guess of where things are. You're right there's some latency in -- when you can make a decision and implement the strategy, and it really differs by business and customer. In some cases, we can implement a price increase by smarter and less discounting.  Some cases there's a surcharge that's possible, some cases, you have to wait for a list price. But I would say our pricing momentum has kept up with the inflation outlook that we started with. But we're running behind because inflations [Indiscernible] than we believe. So your understanding is correct. We're behind inflation now.  Even though the pretty much the full impact of our price increase came through in Q4 will be modestly negative, not hugely modestly negative. Going forward it's a very tough world to guess cost inflation. And we think it's not going to get better soon. We're optimistic it won't get a lot worse. We have some more work to do on the pricing front, but I would say in aggregate, it is still our view that over time we can offset the inflation costs impact with pricing. It's just going to take us into next year to do that.\nChad Dillard: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nKristen Owen: Hi. Good afternoon. This is Christian on for call, thank you for taking the question. Just. And to follow up on some of the commentary around the connection Scale and sort of the acceleration of that spend into 2022, just wondering if you can provide an update on sort of the internal processes that you're going through where you stand in those and any metrics around identifying what that opportunity set is based on the multi-product customers.\nRob Painter: Well, hey, Kristen, this is Rob from let's say, to put context around where we're spending the money, digital -- around digital transformation, and we believe through that digital transformation that that will in turn lead to inability to scale our revenue growth, particularly the recurring revenue growth and the growth of bundled offerings.  We do believe there'll be an Infrastructure Bill that comes and even if it doesn't come, we believe there is a fundamental ability for us to play a positive impact within infrastructure to have it is built better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener. So we've been -- we have been putting more resources to that which we in turn think will help us grow the business.  And we take up both the short-term and long-term view when we come to extent the questions around how we actually come to that answer. And we believe it's the right thing to do for the business. But I think it'll only have answered half your questions, so sorry. Tell me what else we can help with. [Indiscernible]\nKristen Owen: The internal processes, where you are in that process of identifying where you can create synergies internally, how you're going to market more efficiently. Just sort of connecting the internal data backbone. An update there would be really helpful.\nRob Painter: From an internal perspective there, actually, I like the progress we've made through our annual strategy exercise as we do each of our major franchises. I'm have defined there what Connect and scale means to them. And our industry. Cloud strategies are Platform strategies that relationship with Microsoft. And we think is a really big deal for us and where we take the business going forward.  We've got demonstrable success on digital transformation efforts with some of the underlying plumbing that we're putting in place. So things, like, common identity, licensing, entitlement engines, which really are just the call of the must-haves table stakes for where we're going as an organization.  Most of our businesses of identified where they see cross-sell, up-sell opportunity within the customer -- within, I'll say common customer personas. So I like the work that we're doing and in preparation, I wish it could come faster. How about these things do have a bit of a natural course they take.\nKristen Owen: And then if I could, the follow-up to a previous question related to the hardware sales versus our growth. Just wondering, given the strength that you've seen in hardware over the last, call it year or so. How we should think about that as a precursor for ARR growth. Thank you very much.\nRob Painter: Well, most of the ARR that we have is independent of the hardware, where I would say there is a potential precursor as we've talked before about our machine control and guidance business and our -- and civil construction that obviously has hardware and software associated with it and where we've moved to a recurring offering there.  So to the extent that that influx and we see more adoption of that and we have been seeing more adoption of that regardless of how the accounting has treated on it from a practical perspective, it does become more recurring and have an ability to drive that.  In addition, the more we connect that hardware and the software that they have overall, there, I think we see a large installed base of customers or have our hardware that would benefit also by connecting [Indiscernible] to office software to combine with a field hardware. So I do think there's an opportunity there, Christian.\nOperator: Your next question is from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErik Lapinski: Hi team, this is Erik [Indiscernible]. Thanks for squeezing us in. Maybe, just a follow-up on that last question, when we think about some of the incremental investment you're planning over the next year. I was going through this process of connecting more of the assets that whether they were acquired over time or kind of built separately at all, impacted your appetite for M&A? Just wondering if that is a factor.\nRob Painter: No, I'd say it hasn't impacted it all. We will look at acquisitions where we think it can accelerate this strategy, and have a positive impact on Connect & Scale and building out our industry platforms. We also think more of these days is about partnership, and I think Microsoft is a good example of that there's multiple paths to get to this strategy.\nErik Lapinski: Thank you. I mean, maybe if I could squeeze in one more. You talked about the high-teens growth in viewpoint e-Builder, but when we look at overall subscription growth, somewhat flattening organically. Can you help us understand what areas of subscription grew somewhat slower? Is that mostly related to the transportation segment or there are any other factors?\nRob Painter: Transportation segment.\nErik Lapinski: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ed Magi Berenberg Capital. Your line is open.\nEdward Magi: Hi, guys. This is Ed Magi on for Gal Munda. My question relates to the Microsoft partnership with Construction 1, how much of this is technology partnership versus go-to-market efforts? And what do you estimate the timing for GA for this I'd love to hear some examples of new products that could follow after. Thanks.\nRob Painter: Hi, this is Rob. I'll take the question and thanks for the question. So technology and go-to-market from and from a GA perspective on the on both of those intersecting -- I think next year, mid-to-late, next year would be about the time to think about GA. And then before then from a technology perspective, we get, I'll say incentives and help to move technology that we have. So it helped us accelerate the velocity and the development efforts.  So we get some help on the technology side, there. Our nature of relationship does give us a better pricing on the Cloud cycles that we consume. And then yes, the idea is to build the Construction Cloud powered by Azure. And in doing so, we believe there are some unique and novel things that we can bring to that construction Cloud and just think about the breadth and depth of what we do at Trimble.  And now mapped out at a go-to-market perspective, you've got tens of thousands of sellers between Microsoft and Partner network on top of the sellers that we have on a global scale and quickly get a sense of why I am very excited about the opportunities to help us with reach and scale. as a result of this relationship. And we do think that there's some really interesting technologies to combine between the two companies and stay tuned for more on that in time.\nEdward Magi: [Indiscernible] the question and congrats to the quarter.\nRob Painter: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rob Mason of [Indiscernible]. Your line is now open.\nRob Mason: Yes. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I'll try to be real quick here. I just wanted to clarification first the commentary around Connect and Scale investments for this year. Could you confirm, did you say that you thought you would be back on model with respect to incremental margins in 2023 or did I hear that correctly.\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Rob, It's David. So I think I'd characterize our comments is sort of broad outlook to 2022, little early to talk about 2023, But just add a little more color. We are in an investment mode in the areas that Rob talked about in digital transformation, in autonomy, and in our major accounts. Go to market activities, which are all really critical to take advantage of the strategic opportunity we have.  And those are likely to result in OpEx, growth next year ahead of revenue growth. So I think we'll have, if you look back to the 2018 Investor Conference and the objective stated was operating leverage in the 25% to 30% range. I think we'll be in that range, but in 2022 at the lower end. And then I think it's logical to expect that we will have some of the positive benefit of that beginning in 2023. But I'll be cautious about making it firm prediction now.\nRob Mason: Sure, sure. Maybe the follow-on that is, if there was some news in the quarter around where you do have some autonomy exposure. Customer, they're planning to ramp some of the technology they leveraged from you. And how should we think about when that does happen, if it happens when -- is that more step function or is that more linear with, I guess the volumes around that?\nRob Painter: [Indiscernible] take more linear with volumes.\nRob Mason: Okay. Very good.\nOperator: No questions at this time. I would like to return the call back to Michael Leyba, for further comments.\nMichael Leyba: That concludes our call, everyone. Thank you very much and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nRob Painter: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page two with the key messages we want to convey today. In the Third Quarter, our team once again delivered outstanding results and did so within an incredibly difficult supply-chain environment.  We exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of 1.36 billion up 8% year-over-year, and up 11% on an organic basis. Total revenue growth of EBITDA margin of 25.9%, and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $784 million. We achieved record third quarter levels of revenue in many of our businesses.  With another exceptionally strong quarter in machine control and civil construction, guidance in agriculture and Survey and Mapping. For results demonstrate the strength of the underlying market recovery and the quality of our execution against our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy. Our results also demonstrate the quality of the Trimble team.  And I want to give a special shout-out to all our colleagues, led by Leah Lamberton, who are helping us manage through the supply chain challenges on the basis of this collective strength, we are raising our annual earnings guidance despite a tightening supply chain environment. With start with market conditions where the overall land scape remains robust.  Construction backlog is healthy, especially in residential and infrastructure, translating to strengthen in our Geospatial and buildings and infrastructure reporting segments. We remain optimistic that the Infrastructure Bill will ultimately be passed in the U.S., which would bolster our long-term outlook in our construction and surveying businesses, starting at some point in 2023.  We have been and are building product and go-to-market capabilities ahead of this opportunity. I'm especially proud of the role Trimble has played in leading policy advocacy in support of technology adoption, most specifically around advanced digital construction management systems, which provides State Departments of Transportation, with access to funding, to help them accelerate adoption of proven digital design and construction technologies.  We will continue our commitment and support to the nation's Federal Highway Administration and State Departments of Transportation and their pursuit of achieving sustainable and state-of-the-art project delivery. In Agriculture and Forestry, commodity price strength continues to translate into customer buying power and our backlog remains strong.  We are tracking inventory levels of major Ag products which remain in a healthy position and provide some line of sight to continue d farm financial strength. Which we see as an important counterbalance to rising input. Costs on the policy front, we have been advocating for legislate legislative proposal called SB27 -50, Precision Agriculture loan program act in the U.S. that provides low cost loans to farmers to incentivize adoption of precision technologies.  Outside the U.S., we also see positive conditions including ongoing subsidies. And we are beginning to see more policies that promote the use of technology to increase environmental sustainability in transportation, we had another quarter of solid bookings growth, improved customer retention, and higher operating margins.  In September, we announced a strategic relationship with Procter & Gamble, which will shape the development of an agile procurement collaboration platform and will in turn complement our existing set of supply chain focus solutions. Success looks like expediting contracting and onboarding processes to increase the velocity of business transactions while enabling more efficient movement of freight.  I'm also pleased to report that we were the first major technology provider to certify in Canada for the Canadian ELD mandate, evidence of the positive shift in product delivery in the business. On the downside, supply chain is especially disruptive to the operations of many of our trucking customers and will likely constrain our ability to see our execution progression flow through the near term P&L.  Let's turn to Page 3 and talk some about some notable progression of our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy seen through the lens of the Trimble Operating System, capturing strategy people into execution. To set context, our strategy is an industry Platform strategy that manifest and bringing the best of Trimble together with Eco. The system partners to transform industries that support how we live, what we eat, and how we move.  On the heels of cop 26, we're also convinced that we can have a profoundly positive impact on addressing climate change through the use of technology. As approved point of our strategy, we are excited to have announced on October 27th the formation of a strategic partnership with Microsoft to build market and sell our industry Cloud platforms and solutions that connect people, technology, tasks, data, processes, and industry life cycles.  Our initial focus will be to build a Trimble Construction Cloud powered by Microsoft Azure. Importantly, we will also partner on joint go-to-market strategies to globally delivered these cloud innovations. As an additional strategic proof point, at our annual user conference for viewpoint construction management software business, we announced the transition of viewpoints branding to Trimble.  At this user conference, we also launched Trimble Construction 1, as shown on page four. Which extends the capabilities of viewpoints, current SaaS software suite with new and exciting capabilities from other parts of the Trimble Software portfolio.  In addition to the viewpoint financial and operational management capabilities, Trimble Construction One incorporates Trimble's estimating and detailing solutions, as well as Trimble's advanced project management offering, in a single integrated package, which is now being sold by multiple Trimble divisions.  Our direction is clear. We will continue to expand the capabilities of the Trimble Construction One platform for our civil and buildings customers to further connect the physical and digital worlds across construction field and office workflows. On people, we continue to be recognized as a top Company culture and Fast Company recognized us as a best workplace for innovators.  In an increasingly competitive job market, melding Trimble's mission with our innovative culture, is top-of-mind for our talent attraction and retention efforts. As evidence of the attractiveness of Trimble, in September we hired Jennifer Len as Chief Platform Officer and Poppy Crum as our Chief Technology Officer. Both world-class talent who see and believe in our vision and the potential of Trimble.  On execution, we continue to innovate. Our MX50 Mobile Scanner launched in the third quarter, [Indiscernible] a beta release of SketchUp for iPad. And we continue to enhance the capabilities of our best-in-class high-accuracy correction services, which enable positioning down to centimeter levels globally.  We are investing heavily in our own digital transformation, which will provide the system and process fuel to deliver our increasingly connected solutions in an efficient and scalable way. Before I turn the call over to David, I want to talk about how we are operating and leading in the current environment, which presents both volatility and unprecedented opportunity. For years, we have talked about our 3-4-3 operating model.  3 months, 4 quarters, 3 years. I see the role of Trimble leadership as being stewards of capital allocation on behalf of our shareholders, where we balance short-term realities with long-term possibility. As we move towards closing out 2021 and end to 2022, we will continue to support the incremental investments we are putting towards our digital transformation, autonomy, and infrastructure opportunities.  We have high conviction that these investments will create new, sustainable, and differentiated long-term growth opportunities Trimble. And we remain bullish on the long-term secular opportunity for digital technology to make our customers more successful, productive and sustainable. We will have the courage to look through near-term supply chain disruptions in upfront cost of our digital transformation. And to hold ourselves accountable to progressing our Connect & Scale strategy. David, overview. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.9% down 90 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher operating expenses and investments in the business. Operating margin was 23.8% down 40 basis points year-over-year, but still up over 300 basis points versus the pre-COVID third quarter of 2019. Operating expenses last year were unusually low in a number of areas, including compensation expense.  Net income dollars increased by 10% and earnings per share increased by $0.06 to $0.66 per share. Our third quarter cash flow from operations was a 166 million and free cash flow was a 156 million. Cash flow was down modestly year-over-year in the quarter. As we are purchasing inventory in response to strong demand and supply chain shortages.  Operating cash flow is up 23% on a year-to-date basis, with a conversion ratio to net income above 1.1 times. Our net debt declined 88 million in the quarter, and our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 0.9 times. During the third quarter we repurchased a $100 million of common stock. Year-over-year and perpetual software growing 19%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction Geospatial and Agriculture. Our hardware growth contributed to perpetual software growth. As some of our hardware offerings are. Bundled with perpetual software. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 11% in Europe, revenues were up 18%.  Asia-Pacific was up 5% year-over-year and the rest of the world was up 33%, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector in Brazil. Next on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics we follow, and I'll start with ARR. While total Company ARR grew 11% organically on a year-over-year basis, ARR excluding transportation, grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter.  Networking capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, continued to be negative, representing approximately -2% of revenue on a trailing 12 month basis. Notwithstanding an acceleration in purchases of component inventory during Q3. Research and development on a trailing 12 month basis was 15% of revenue, and our deferred revenue grew 17% year-over-year.  Our backlog at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion up from $1.5 billion a quarter earlier, and up over 30% year-over-year. While growth on our backlog is an indicator of momentum in the business, it is also reflective of the shortages and extended delivery times that we are experiencing for many key components in our hardware products.  Of our 1.6 billion in backlog, just under $340 million relates to our hardware offerings, up from about a $100 million in hardware backlog a year ago, and $38 million higher than the end of Q2. We expect supply chain constraints for many key components to extend well into Hi, and thanks for the questions. This is Rob. So I'll give you a walk around the end markets and some of the positives and some of the potential gotchas that we're looking out for. And the things we're looking out for that could be to the negative would be around supply chain inflation in labor availability and of course, all of those things correlate.  On the Geospatial and Construction side, we see strength in residential and infrastructure work right now we see on the commercial side strengthen sub-markets such as data centers and hospitals. We believe there's an indicator that the residential work will drive light industrial work as it relates to the infrastructure bill and if it doesn't pass, we would see a benefit of the infrastructure bill really in 2023. So we really don't expect anything in 2022.  Of course, there's a sentiment aspect that's hard to quantify, but are -- but we remain that optimistic and I spent some time in Washington a couple of weeks ago to that end. And when I think about construction and I think about the labor side of it as a potential downside. The benefit of technology is that it can make an inexperienced operator good.  Our Geospatial market or robotic total station can turned to person operation into a one person operation. On the Ag side, what's positive our commodity prices, it looks like the harvest -- early data on the harvest would suggest a lower harvest, which would hold up commodity prices and then the index that against the ending stocks or the inventory. As you said, absolutely input inflation, I think is what's starting to dent the optimism on the farmer front.  With that input inflation, though I look at the value proposition of the of the technology. So a spot spray technology can reduce the use of herbicide. And that's a really big deal, where the variable rate can reduce the use of the other inputs. And as we know, also has a positive environmental sustainability benefit.  At a Geographic level the subsidy policies tend to be more consistent and higher outside the U.S., so that tends to be -- provides a ballast, let's say to the overall market, but we're absolutely paying, attention to all of this at some point. This is -- we'll have to have an impact. On the transportation side, what we see is strength in spot pricing and I mean, we even seen it from our own rates on transportation as David talked about them, where they've gone up.  A downside is driver availability in the market and availability of trucks coming out of the OEMs so carriers are having trouble actually adding capacity. And when I think about a technology lens on that, an average driver effectively uses around 7 hours of their clock per day. Our strategy is to drive a more connected supply chain.  That means dynamic schedules with the shippers and the receivers to better optimize wasted driver hours. We provide better routing and navigation solutions to create efficient trip management. And fundamentally, we want to get at more accurate order [Indiscernible] load information for the customers. And that can increased the network optimization. So there's puts and takes as always, and we think that technology has a role really in almost any market condition. Hi, thanks for the question. So the combined ARR growth between the 2 businesses was set up plus 17% year-over-year. So another great quarter of execution between the 2 businesses. As you noted with the rebranding, we are especially optimistic around the Trimble Construction One offering. We converted over a 1,000 customers to the Trimble Construction One offering.  Sold dozens of new logos onto the offering in the quarter and that -- bookings that creates ARR later down the road but the value proposition and the awareness from the customers is quite encouraging. And we've seen that in the bookings for some time now and which now plays through the ARR expansion. There are both. It's a good question. From a market -- overall market perspective, really the secular opportunity and construction technology, by the way, I would see this in our other end markets as well. Is that these markets are large. They're global, they're underserved, and they are underpenetrated by a technology.  So the move to digitization provides a value proposition that delivers productivity, quality, safety, efficiency, transparency, the environmental sustainability. So there's a positive catalyst for technology to be adopted. And at some level, yes, that is replacing paper-based systems. That exists or let's says just the mental based systems that exist.  And we are seeing demonstrable interest from customers in the connected solutions that we offer and I've had a chance to talk to a number of the customers personally, some that are shown us how they're already taking our technology and connecting the various solutions to improve their workflow. And one of the things they do is not only connect a Trimble workflow, but an Trimble environment that can provide actually accommodate environment.  We can connect in an open and really agnostic way to the other technology that our customers use. Customers operated as you know, in the construction industry is fragmented. Therefore, the technology tends to be a bit fragmented as well. And so our ability in approach to connect Trimble and non-Trimble solutions is very top-of-mind for customers.  And of course, COVID has also been a catalyst from a digitization perspective. So much of what we do, can uniquely connect the work in the office and the field that connects the hardware and the software and ultimately that physical and digital. Hi Rob and thanks for the question. From a tipping point perspective and an acceleration perspective, I think the numbers would prove the acceleration of the adoption of technology. And if we were to get an infrastructure bill, which by the way, we're talking about that in a U.S. context.  But we see a construction lead recovery really globally in many markets. And so HS2 is a really nice project in the U.K., [Indiscernible] and Paris. The rail project is expected to be a very large project, and there's large projects happening and Saudi and Australia continues to have some big development.  We see the fundamentals in the macro's providing ability to accelerate it. I think, really, the move to have the digitization, COVID I really do feel has accelerated that perhaps hasn't inflected so many of our customers were unable to actually go out to the field like they used to go to do or they realize the need to be Cloud connected in Cloud -enabled when they weren't going to their offices at frequent, as frequently.  And we think that's helped us drive more bookings in the business to the cloud offerings. And as it relates to a tipping point that's a really good question. That's a bit of a crystal ball. I think one of the catalysts that could create a tipping point, would be if we see more of this driven from owners. And I will say as well as regulators and maybe I really mean policy when I say that.  So from an owner perspective, that's actually the premise of why we did the e-Builder acquisition because who fundamentally has the most at stake when a project's late or over budget, of course it's the owner and so we help them manage their capital programs. From a policy and regulatory perspective, where we have a point of view as we the [Indiscernible] take that U.S. infrastructure bill as an example.  I mean this is a generational opportunity to increase the competitiveness of the united -- of the infrastructure in the U.S.. And we can deliver that infrastructure 20%, 30% cheaper through the use of technology. So it just makes sense.  And so, if more of this, if we can increase the level of awareness, I'm certainly an [Indiscernible] that there's a policy measure here are certainly encouragement measure, and that's why I talked about that digital construction Management Act because it provides an incentive for DOTs to adopt technology. I'd say we're all staying tuned for that one. There is something that's sort of fundamentally creates an acceleration on that -- on the tipping point part of it.  And then you asked about platforms, Rob. And on the platform side, I think it is logical to think that there would be some coalescing around a few platforms. I mean, as you said, the industry is rather fragmented. We're not the only technology platform out there actually. I think there needs to be interoperability between those technology platforms, and that very much shapes how we build our technology. It is an underlying fundamental belief that we have. You're welcome. Hey Jonathan. It's Rob, I'll take that one. I'd say the product mix is relatively stable at the moment. What I would say, we're doing a better job of is connecting the software and the hardware and the correction services into the offerings that we have some more of that bundling at a point-of-sale and making ourselves easier to do business with.  We have picked up some new OEM customers along the way, and then we've seen some strength in -- particular strength in various geographies. So in the quarter Brazil was very strong for us. Russia was also very strong for us. So there's, I'd say there's pockets, geographic pockets, where we're able to increase the penetration. In terms of a discernible shift in the overall mix of the portfolio. Not really at this point. Sure. Hi, Jerry thanks for the question. Within the transportation business, historically talked about 3 legs on the stool though the technology stack. The first being that we provide mapping, routing, navigation engines. Second, that we provide the back office technology for trucking companies. And third, that we provide the field mobility tools for companies. In terms of the booking and then those are the 3 historic legs of that stool.  And then over the last couple of years, we've moved as well to address the shipper side of the market whereas historically this strength is on the carrier side. On the carrier side of the business, where we see the bookings, growth is in a couple of places. So first in that [Indiscernible] ERP systems, we called it a Transportation Management System and we're moving that business to a recurring model. So there's a model conversion that's happening in there.  And we have seen evidence that we're increasing the size of the addressable market, which means we're reaching some customers that we hadn't previously reached. And that's translating into 20% plus bookings growth on a year over year basis in that part of the business.  What we're seeing as well on the mobility side, which is really more of the EOD part of the business. As we have seen, some life there, both through two things. 1,... increasing penetration and existing customers as some of our existing customers, actually many of them are adding capacity given the market.  In fact, they would like to add more capacity in many cases aren't able to actually get the vehicles are the drivers to do it, but that's one area where we see growth. And the others as we do see some logos are coming back to us, which has been a really good sign for us. Still a long way to go, but I'm liking what I'm seeing from the team, and the pace of the team, and the trajectory and that Canadian ELD certification was a nice proof point that we're not just talking about these things, that we are actually also are delivering.  That mapping, routing, navigation business has had many, many years of double-digit recurring revenue growth, which means bookings continue to grow strong and they continue to do a great job in quarter-in and in quarter-out. [Indiscernible] up and that got to the commentary on the script. You asked Jerry about the churn rate as well. Yeah. On the churn rate side, I'd characterize it in net retention, and net retention was above 100% in the quarter, which is obviously a great sign for us. So, yes, actually we do think we can accelerate the level of our growth actually across the Company. And then that being the biggest contributor really to that growth, it absolutely -- it's something that we have a line of -- reasonable line of sight to after the current bookings growth as we plan the business forward, we'll think about in any given quarter or a year for that matter, what's quote-on-quote in the bank and then what's the go-get when we think about that go-get than you can measure the pipeline you have and then you measure the qualified leads you have against that.  So you kind of just keep working backwards from that equation and then do you have the horsepower to go and possible effect the pipeline and to turn it into a booking which eventually turns into the revenue. In addition, Jerry another catalyst to rest coming into next year is, our structures business. So that will [Indiscernible] business, the steel concrete business, so that in the summer, we stopped selling perpetual licenses.  And so -- in fact, we sold more perpetual this year than we had anticipated and now that we're off the -- almost entirely off the perpetual, that just by the math will provide a catalyst for ARR our [Indiscernible] bookings, which will turn into ARR so that alone would be a catalyst to our ARR growth in that business looking into next year. You're welcome. Hi, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. Big kudos to the Geospatial team. The latest innovation that went to market in the third quarter was the MX50 Mobile Mapping System. And that's on the heels just really many innovations over the last few quarters between the X7 Laser Scanner our [Indiscernible] receiver a really nice run for this. The business has I'd say a pretty good amount of backlog associated with it.  As we look forward into 2022, we think that we do have the [Indiscernible] at our backs and that we can continue to grow the business. Now the stunning growth that we've had in that business in 2022 or 2021, excuse me. No, I don't see that that wouldn't progress as we've said a few years ago, we -- that this was we think thought of it as our most mature of the businesses that we have and it has proved to more than once lately to be the -- one of the fastest growers within Trimble on a year-over-year basis, so really a lot of excellent innovation.  And as well, our go-to-market team has just done an outstanding job with the channel management around the world. And I would expect that to temper back somewhere closer into the Company average of the 6 to 9 organic range as we go into next year. I would take that as a starting point. Oh, thank you for that question. So I'm excited and I'm actually quite inspired by the ability Trimble to play a fundamentally positive impact, or a fundamentally positive role in impacting climate change. Now, the truth of the matter is that our products and our technology have had a positive environmental, sustainability benefit for as long as we have been around. I mean, it's been a byproduct of the productivity and efficiency that our customers generate.  What I see as an opportunity is that comes more and more to the forefront. In some cases, it's just our customers have more reporting to do themselves. Whether they realize it now, some of them do and or rather they don't, we see that coming and then we see an ability to go to move into that space. If you take Agriculture as an example, we do have a small business in Ag that essentially runs a carbon marketplace.  We get calls from customers or potential customers asking for help in certifying the offsets that they're buying. Think about our -- we tend to talk about our Agriculture business, but we also have a nice forestry business. These are two places that are hugely important in this conversation. And so as big companies are making their own commitments and buying offsets, they don't want to buy bad offsets.  And so we're encouraged by the types of calls that we're getting because it's giving us conviction of where we take our product road map to positively impact us. I mean, if I think about the construction space, our structures business, so the steel part of the structures business.  We did an announcement a couple of weeks ago of something that I think is pretty compelling as we can continue from a design perspective, essentially to design for sustainability, to understand the carbon load that a building has during that design and engineering phase. For many years, we've had a pre -design product to help you understand, let's say the energy consumption profile of a building.  And as the users of the buildings on let's say, if there becomes regulatory pressure on this, to design with carbon in mind, the constructible models that we provide at Trimble have a profoundly positive ability to impact designing and maintaining and operating with sustainability in mind. So we're actually putting some -- our resources to this.  Because I see, all of us at Trimble see or board sees some really interesting opportunities that at some point will turn into commercial opportunities. Now that they turn into commercial opportunities is something discrete and separate, or are they part of the existing technologies we have? I would see there I don't know. But you follow what's going on and you've got -- I've got to believe that there's some material business for us to have here. Thank you. Hi. Chad, so this is Rob, I'll take the question. So where to start? Our Trimble Construction 1 offering, essentially right now can take what we do at viewpoint. I mean, at viewpoint, years ago, we moved from selling, I'll call it an ERP on an office - based solution to moving to selling a combined team and Field Solutions, so think, project management and field mobility tools. And we called it viewpoint one and then we caught an [Indiscernible] office team field offerings.  So it moved from a point solution to a bundled viewpoints solution and now that next step is and to Trimble Construction 1, what the first release of it. That brings in many aspects of our MEP business. So it's mechanical, electrical, plumbing business and we're able to bring in detail or an estimator workflows into the product offering.  And then from there, we have a basis where we can continue to expand across other architectural and engineering workflows and products that we have. So by and large, it's taking what we do already and having a better packaging around that. Making it easier for our customers to consume the technology.  From a technology perspective, it's better integration, tighter integration between the solutions that we have. Our customers have been asking for this, and so we're really excited to be able to start delivering upon it. I would say it's just the start. It's Version 1 of Trimble Construction 1. There are many other capabilities that we believe we can bring into that both from a civil perspective as well as a vertical construction perspective.  And the natures of the conversions we have thus far are predominantly with the existing customers and moving them over. But we did get a few dozen new logos during the quarter on Trimble Construction 1. It's very much a persona based growth platform. We think about personas and in architectural engineering work persona, we think about a contractor persona.  We think about an owner persona. And then we'll as we migrate over time will get -- be able to get more and more. I'll say specific and targeted to delivering Construction, Trimble Construction 1, to those individual persona.  So I'd really say the start of much more to come and the more that we connect the data, the users, and the workflow across this data be gets the opportunity to move into richer data, AI opportunities. And there it gets then another level of exciting so the more we can connect what we've got for our customers, the more of that will create solutions down the road. Well, hey, Kristen, this is Rob from let's say, to put context around where we're spending the money, digital -- around digital transformation, and we believe through that digital transformation that that will in turn lead to inability to scale our revenue growth, particularly the recurring revenue growth and the growth of bundled offerings.  We do believe there'll be an Infrastructure Bill that comes and even if it doesn't come, we believe there is a fundamental ability for us to play a positive impact within infrastructure to have it is built better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener. So we've been -- we have been putting more resources to that which we in turn think will help us grow the business.  And we take up both the short-term and long-term view when we come to extent the questions around how we actually come to that answer. And we believe it's the right thing to do for the business. But I think it'll only have answered half your questions, so sorry. Tell me what else we can help with. [Indiscernible] From an internal perspective there, actually, I like the progress we've made through our annual strategy exercise as we do each of our major franchises. I'm have defined there what Connect and scale means to them. And our industry. Cloud strategies are Platform strategies that relationship with Microsoft. And we think is a really big deal for us and where we take the business going forward.  We've got demonstrable success on digital transformation efforts with some of the underlying plumbing that we're putting in place. So things, like, common identity, licensing, entitlement engines, which really are just the call of the must-haves table stakes for where we're going as an organization.  Most of our businesses of identified where they see cross-sell, up-sell opportunity within the customer -- within, I'll say common customer personas. So I like the work that we're doing and in preparation, I wish it could come faster. How about these things do have a bit of a natural course they take. Well, most of the ARR that we have is independent of the hardware, where I would say there is a potential precursor as we've talked before about our machine control and guidance business and our -- and civil construction that obviously has hardware and software associated with it and where we've moved to a recurring offering there.  So to the extent that that influx and we see more adoption of that and we have been seeing more adoption of that regardless of how the accounting has treated on it from a practical perspective, it does become more recurring and have an ability to drive that.  In addition, the more we connect that hardware and the software that they have overall, there, I think we see a large installed base of customers or have our hardware that would benefit also by connecting [Indiscernible] to office software to combine with a field hardware. So I do think there's an opportunity there, Christian. No, I'd say it hasn't impacted it all. We will look at acquisitions where we think it can accelerate this strategy, and have a positive impact on Connect & Scale and building out our industry platforms. We also think more of these days is about partnership, and I think Microsoft is a good example of that there's multiple paths to get to this strategy. Transportation segment. Hi, this is Rob. I'll take the question and thanks for the question. So technology and go-to-market from and from a GA perspective on the on both of those intersecting -- I think next year, mid-to-late, next year would be about the time to think about GA. And then before then from a technology perspective, we get, I'll say incentives and help to move technology that we have. So it helped us accelerate the velocity and the development efforts.  So we get some help on the technology side, there. Our nature of relationship does give us a better pricing on the Cloud cycles that we consume. And then yes, the idea is to build the Construction Cloud powered by Azure. And in doing so, we believe there are some unique and novel things that we can bring to that construction Cloud and just think about the breadth and depth of what we do at Trimble.  And now mapped out at a go-to-market perspective, you've got tens of thousands of sellers between Microsoft and Partner network on top of the sellers that we have on a global scale and quickly get a sense of why I am very excited about the opportunities to help us with reach and scale. as a result of this relationship. And we do think that there's some really interesting technologies to combine between the two companies and stay tuned for more on that in time. Thank you. [Indiscernible] take more linear with volumes. Thanks, everybody."

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue was $9101 million up 14% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 1% in divestitures subtracted 2% for a total organic revenue increase of 15%. Gross margin in the third quarter was 58.7% down 10 basis points year-over-year, reflecting several factors including higher product and freight costs in our supply chain, offset by increased pricing and lower discounting. At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available in our revolving credit facility and approximately $513 million in cash. Our balance sheet is strong and we are well-positioned to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. Turning now to Slide 6, I will review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends.  As mentioned earlier our ARR was up 8% in aggregate and was up 11% organically on a year-over-year basis. The 11% rate excludes the impact of foreign exchange and our recent divestitures of IRON Solutions, Manhattan Real Estate Solutions, and Construction Logistics. All three of these divested businesses had a recurring revenue component, but we're in areas outside of our strategic roadmap. Our non-recurring revenue streams grew with hardware up 18% 2022. Let's turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 12% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our building and civil Construction businesses and organic ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter.  Geospatial revenue was up 23% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment's. Margins were up 60 basis points due to both revenue growth and operating costs control. Resources and utilities revenue was up 23% on an organic basis. We experienced double-digit growth in each of our precision agriculture and positioning services offerings.  Margins in resources and utilities contracted 330 basis points and were hardest hit by product cost inflation in the quarter. Financial results in transportation show ed progression in a number of areas. Revenue was up 3% on an organic basis year-over-year, but grew less than we expected due to supply chain challenges, both in our operations and our customers' businesses.  Margins expanded 410 basis points year-over-year. Turning now to Page 9 for our updated outlook for the full year. We are raising our expectation for full-year revenue with a new range of $3.59 billion to $3.64 billion, representing growth for the full year in the mid-teens and single-digit year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. End market demand is even stronger than we thought it would be a quarter ago.  But supply chain constraints will likely cause our backlog to remain at or above the increased levels from the end of Q3. Air or growth at the Company level is trending as we anticipated, driven by strong bookings and subscription transition. And we expect organic [Indiscernible] growth of greater than 10% in the fourth quarter and a strong entry point going into 2022.  Gross margins in the fourth quarter are likely to be about flat sequentially with the third quarter. An increasing mix of software will have a favorable impact on sequential gross margin trends. But this benefit will be offset by an anticipated decline in hardware margins. In aggregate, we now expect that the net impact of accelerating hardware cost inflation, and our recent price increases will be modestly negative to hardware margins in Q4.  Building off our strong third quarter results, our outlook for operating margins continues to improve, and we now expect operating margins for the full-year 2021 will be above 2020. Operating margins in the fourth quarter of this year will likely be lower than the fourth quarter of 2020, driven both by higher hardware component costs year-on-year, and by higher operating expense as OpEx was unusually low in 2020, and we're now ramping up investments against our strategy.  Our outlook for full-year earnings per share, has increased to $2.61 to $2.69, representing growth of approximately 17 to 21% year-over-year. We continue to expect operating cash flow greater than 1.1 times net income and free cash flow greater than 1 times net income, reflecting the strong cash-generated aspects of our business model. I'd like to comment briefly on the outlook and fourth quarter for our transportation segment.  As Rob (ph) mentioned earlier, the leading indicators for this business are strong with growing bookings of recurring solutions, sequentially improving customer retention in our mobility business, an increasing sign that are connected transportation strategy is resonating with customers.  Nevertheless, factors related to the global supply chain and the extraordinary pressure on the transportation industry will negatively impact our business momentum in the short run. Our OEM business will be constrained by customer manufacturing challenges. And the aftermarket business will be slowed by the fact the trucking companies are reluctant to take assets off the road for technology upgrades, at a time of high transportation prices and extraordinary asset utilization.  We believe that these constraints will be resolved over time and we remain confident in the turnaround of this business. But the pace of improvement of revenue, ARR and profitability will be lower than we had earlier projected. With regard to 2022, we don't plan to give detailed guidance until our year-end earnings release, but we can characterize some of the drivers that we see now.  And there is expected impact on revenue ARR and margins. Demand across our end markets remains strong and we believe that strength will sustain at least through the end of 2022. Our customers need for digital solutions to optimize their workflows has never been stronger and these customers have the money and the desire to invest.  We expect organic ARR growth to accelerate in 2022, building off the momentum we have now and aided by continued model transitions and the growing sale of connected recurring solutions. The supply chain environment remains our biggest challenge and that challenge is predicted to be with us for several more quarters.  From a cost perspective, we anticipate that inflation in our hardware businesses will be sustained through the first quarters of 2022, driven both by higher component costs and higher cost of getting products shipped to our manufacturers and distribution centers. It is the goal of our pricing strategy to offset the impact of inflation on our hardware gross margins, and that pricing strategy continues to evolve.  Rob referenced in his remarks, the investments we are making against our digital transformation. We anticipate that as we get through this investment cycle in 2022 and as our software businesses continue their transition to recurring revenue models, our operating leverage will be lower in 2022 than we expect over the longer term.  The investments we're making in our digital transformation are at the core of unlocking the potential of our platform strategy. And we expect to end 2022 with business processes and systems that will accelerate our ability to transform the way we go to market, and the way our customers do their work. With that, I will turn it over to the Operator for Q&A. Hey, Jonathan, it's David. The lead times vary a lot by product, but historically, our lead times have been very short measured in a few days. And there are many times that, so weeks and in some cases, many weeks or a few months, and that's the math of the backlog that you're seeing. As far as the competitive dynamics, in a very few isolated cases, we can identify where we've lost business to a competitor that can supply more quickly.  Typically they are competing at the lower end of the market and in some cases those customers have come back. But I think the generally our competitors are experiencing at least similar pressure to where we have and we don't believe that this has had an adverse impact on our share trends. In fact, in our hardware businesses where we can see numbers that are published by our peers or competitors.  There is evidence in many of those segments that we're gaining share. We also haven't seen a meaningful amount of orders being canceled because the lead times are extended. So it's something we're watchful for. We're lucky as Rob said in his comments, have a really capable of. Operations team that has done a remarkable job getting supply in this very difficult environment. Hey, Chad, let me give you some perspective and all sort of ground. My comments in what we mentioned last time, when this very uncertain world we were estimating that for the full year 2021, we'd have inflation in aggregate of about 6% of our $600 million in COGS, so that's $36 million. We're definitely running north of that. We're probably about $10 million more in product and freight inflation than we were anticipating.  And we've adopted our pricing strategy all year in response to our best guess of where things are. You're right there's some latency in -- when you can make a decision and implement the strategy, and it really differs by business and customer. In some cases, we can implement a price increase by smarter and less discounting.  Some cases there's a surcharge that's possible, some cases, you have to wait for a list price. But I would say our pricing momentum has kept up with the inflation outlook that we started with. But we're running behind because inflations [Indiscernible] than we believe. So your understanding is correct. We're behind inflation now.  Even though the pretty much the full impact of our price increase came through in Q4 will be modestly negative, not hugely modestly negative. Going forward it's a very tough world to guess cost inflation. And we think it's not going to get better soon. We're optimistic it won't get a lot worse. We have some more work to do on the pricing front, but I would say in aggregate, it is still our view that over time we can offset the inflation costs impact with pricing. It's just going to take us into next year to do that. Hey, Rob, It's David. So I think I'd characterize our comments is sort of broad outlook to 2022, little early to talk about 2023, But just add a little more color. We are in an investment mode in the areas that Rob talked about in digital transformation, in autonomy, and in our major accounts. Go to market activities, which are all really critical to take advantage of the strategic opportunity we have.  And those are likely to result in OpEx, growth next year ahead of revenue growth. So I think we'll have, if you look back to the 2018 Investor Conference and the objective stated was operating leverage in the 25% to 30% range. I think we'll be in that range, but in 2022 at the lower end. And then I think it's logical to expect that we will have some of the positive benefit of that beginning in 2023. But I'll be cautious about making it firm prediction now."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Trimble Second Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  And I would now like to hand the call over to Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer of Trimble.\nRob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today. In the second quarter, our team delivered outstanding results. We exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.35 billion, up 11% year-over-year, total revenue growth of 29%, EBITDA margin of 26.4% and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $798 million. We achieved record levels of revenue in many of our businesses, with exceptionally strong performance in machine control in civil construction, guidance in Agriculture and Survey in Mapping. Our results demonstrate the quality of our strategy and our business model. On the basis of this strength, we are raising our guidance for the year. Turning to market conditions. The overall landscape is generally robust. Construction backlog is healthy, especially in residential and infrastructure. We remain optimistic that an Infrastructure Bill will ultimately be passed in the United States, which would further improve our long-term outlook in our Construction and Surveying businesses. In Agriculture and Forestry, commodity price strength is translating into customer buying power. In Transportation, market strength has shifted back to carriers and this, in addition to improved execution, is translating into solid bookings growth. As discussed last quarter, we are investing in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure and are stepping up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble Cloud Platform and our autonomy efforts. Our team is highly focused on executing our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy, which centers on building leading industry cloud platforms. Our strategy differentiates at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds. As an example, our hardware businesses allow us to capture data and execute work in the field, while improving the efficiency and efficacy of workflows between the office and the field. At Trimble, we develop our strategies with an endgame backwards mindset. We balance short-term and long-term deliverables with our 3, 4, 3 operating model, 3 months, 4 quarters, 3 years. This is worth noting as quarterly comparables are skewed with COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions. We have to be able to see through the performance of any given quarter and play the long game, which we continue to believe presents a compelling secular opportunity. We are focused on metrics such as ARR, backlog, EBITDA and cash flow as much as we focus on revenue and EPS. The combination of these metrics presents a more holistic picture of our performance.  Let's turn next to Page 3 for some proof points that the Trimble Operating System, capturing strategy, people and execution is producing results. Starting with strategy. We continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities. In Buildings and Infrastructure, our structural steel, concrete, mechanical, electrical and plumbing businesses are hitting their stride with their business model transformations. Bookings, ARR growth and new logo wins are evidence that the team is expanding the addressable market. In Transportation, our recurring bookings were up significantly year-over-year, also evidence that the conversion is working. On the divestiture front, we closed the sale of Manhattan Software in the second quarter and IRON Solutions early in the third quarter. Since January of 2020, we have divested or exited 8 businesses. We are focused on building our industry-leading and cloud-connected technology platforms that enable customers to transform workflows by connecting Trimble and third-party capabilities. On people, I'm pleased to report that our leadership team was recognized by our employee base as one of the top leadership teams in a Global Culture Survey. We were also recognized as a top-performing company for women and diversity. And our engineering team ranked as a global leading team. I'm proud of my colleagues and our purpose-driven culture. It's this team that is transforming the way the world works. In addition, we strengthened our Board of Directors with the announcement that Ann Fandozzi will join our Board in the next couple of weeks. On execution, we continue to innovate. During the quarter, we announced an autonomy partnership with HORSCH. We extended our machine control platform to soil compactors and we introduced our infrastructure BIM collaboration software in North America. In addition, one of the proof points we monitor is cross-sell annual contract value. Early wins in Construction and Transportation increase our conviction that we are on the right track with our bundled offerings. Turning to Page 4. I'm excited to announce that earlier today, we launched Trimble Ventures, our corporate venture capital arm, with a commitment of $200 million of capital. Our objective is to co-invest in Series A through Series D rounds in emerging technologies as well as in companies that will extend our industry platforms. Our co-heads of Trimble Ventures include our Treasurer, Phil Sawarynsky; and Ron Antevy, Co-Founder of our e-Builder business. In closing, it was the second quarter last year where we faced the initial and biggest uncertainty with COVID-19. While the virus and its variants remain highly concerning around the world, I want to step back and reflect on an early principle we established, which is we said we would emerge from the pandemic on a stronger relative competitive footing than when we entered the pandemic. Our results demonstrate we are doing exactly this. My gratitude to my 11,000-plus Trimble colleagues and our global partners and customers, we've got this. David, over to you.\nDavid Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's start on 5 with a review of second quarter results. Second quarter revenue was $945 million, up 29% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 27%. Customer demand was healthy, rebounding across all of our end markets at a rate stronger than we anticipated. Gross margin in the second quarter was 58.2%. Gross margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by the shift in mix in our business, with a higher percentage of hardware this quarter and the onset of product cost inflation given the disruptions we are seeing in our supply chain, partially offset by lower discounting. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, up 70 basis points, driven by higher revenue. Operating income margins expanded 110 basis points to 24.2%. As expected, our operating costs were up meaningfully from the second quarter of last year, when we had unusually low compensation expense and a very tight focus on cost control in light of the COVID lockdowns. Net income increased by 40%, and earnings per share increased by $0.20 to $0.72 per share. Our second quarter cash flow from operations was $201 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $190 million. Our net debt decreased over $225 million in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1. At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $484 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and inorganically. Turning now to Slide 6. I'll review in a bit more detail our second quarter revenue trends. As noted earlier, our ARR was up 11% in the quarter, with organic ARR growth of approximately 10%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a high teens rate in the quarter. Encouragingly, ARR trends in Transportation improved with segment organic ARR approximately flat versus a year earlier. Our nonrecurring revenue streams experienced strong growth relative to the second quarter of 2020, during which our business was most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 shutdowns. Our Hardware revenue grew 47% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in Civil Construction, Geospatial and Agriculture. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 23%. In Europe, revenues were up 41%. Currency fluctuations positively impacted growth in Europe by about 9%, with the balance coming from catch up on project activity, which has slowed in 2020, fiscal stimulus measures and recovering demand in many end markets. Asia Pacific grew 19% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in Australia and New Zealand. The Rest of World, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 49% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the other key metrics that we follow. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 2% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Our deferred revenue grew 14% year-over-year. An important story this quarter is the growth of our backlog. Total backlog at quarter end was approximately $1.5 billion. Of that total, approximately $300 million relates to unfilled orders for hardware products. This compares with hardware backlog of about $100 million at the end of the second quarter last year, which is a more typical level for our business. In this time of both exceptionally strong customer demand and increasing supply chain pressures, our operations team did an extraordinary job, which enabled our record year-on-year Hardware revenue growth of 47%. Turning now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 22% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our Building and Civil Construction businesses, with Hardware revenue across the segment up greater than 40%. Segment margins were down 40 basis points, due primarily to revenue mix. Across our recurring software offerings in this segment, bookings were strong, up approximately 25% versus a year ago. Geospatial revenue was up 48% on an organic basis. We saw a rebound in demand across nearly all of the end markets for our Geospatial offerings, and our new products are generating significant customer enthusiasm. Operating margins were up 430 basis points due to strong revenue growth and the success of new products. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 32% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in Precision Agriculture and Positioning Services. Margins expanded 160 basis points. Top line results in Transportation met our expectations. Revenue was up 9% on an organic basis year-on-year. The drivers of revenue growth were improved trends in both our mobility and enterprise businesses. Margins declined 170 basis points on a year-over-year basis due to increased mix of low-margin hardware and increased operating costs, but margins improved sequentially over first quarter levels. We remain confident that we are on track for continued sequential improvement as the year progresses. Turning now to our outlook for the full year. Our performance in the second quarter and the strength of our backlog give us the visibility and confidence to raise our outlook for the year. I'll point out that supply chain constraints continue to present us with meaningful uncertainty as the availability of some critical components remains unpredictable. The outlook I'll describe represents our best sense of this dynamic environment. I'll also point out that comparisons versus the quarters of 2020 are difficult to draw meaning from as the impact of the onset of COVID and the recovery following market reopenings created large swings last year. We will focus more on sequential evolution from the second quarter through to the second half.  We are raising our outlook for the full year revenue to between $3.55 billion and $3.65 billion. Demand remains resilient across all of our end markets, but our Hardware revenues will likely be constrained by our ability to source key components. Note that this new revenue range incorporates our divestitures, including the recent divestitures of our Manhattan Software and IRON Solutions businesses. Divestitures will reduce our revenue growth in 2021 by a little over 100 basis points, but are reflective of our increasing focus on platforms, which connect the workflows in RT end markets. Sequentially, we expect that revenue in the second half will be well above 2020 levels, but below the levels we realized in the first half of 2021. The expectation of lower revenue in the second half versus the first half is entirely driven by constraints in our supply chain. We expect to end the year with hardware backlog at levels similar to the end of the second quarter. Given our strong bookings trends across our recurring software businesses, we expect organic ARR growth of approximately 10% for the full year. We anticipate that second half gross margins will be down approximately 50 to 100 basis points below second half 2020 margins, due to the net impact of product mix and cost pressures, partially offset by price increases. We are implementing price increases across many of the product lines impacted by the recent inflationary spike. But overall, the net impact on gross margins will still be adverse year-over-year for both the back half and full year 2021. We expect to experience the greatest gross margin pressure in the third quarter as we won't realize the full benefit of our price increases until the fourth quarter.  Our outlook for operating margins has improved as the leverage from higher revenue more than offsets the impact of mix shift, increasing product cost inflation and the investments we are making in support of our strategy. We now expect that operating margin for the full year 2021 will be comparable to 2020. Note that our software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring are accelerating in the back half of this year. These transitions will adversely impact operating margins by 150 to 200 basis points in the second half of 2021.  Our outlook for full year earnings per share has increased to $2.45 to $2.65 per share. From a cash flow perspective, given our strong performance in the first half of 2021, we expect cash flow from operations for the full year of greater than 1.1x non-GAAP net income, with free cash flow comfortably exceeding non-GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.\nAshokSivamohan: This is Ashok Sivamohan on for Jerry Revich. Can you talk about the ARR growth for e-Builder and Viewpoint? And out of the growth, what proportion was from new logos?\nRobPainter: The total ARR growth for the combination of Viewpoint and e-Builder was 17% in the quarter year-over-year. As it relates to new logos, we had actually strong performance in the quarter on new logo bookings. So it's a good sign that the Connect & Scale strategy is bearing fruit inside of Construction.\nAshokSivamohan: Okay. And in Resources and Utilities, one of your customers is acquiring a competitor. Can you talk about your views on the competitive landscape as it relates to Trimble?\nRobPainter: Well, to set context for the competitive landscape, let's start with the macros in the agriculture market. As we all know, it's -- the commodity prices are high, and that is fueling a positive farmer net income. So there's an attractive backdrop against that, farmer sentiment is high, new machine sales are strong. So the place to start is at the top level with the market conditions that are positive. And you see that playing through the results in the Resources and Utility segment, and the team did a really nice job in the quarter and really through of this year.  From a competitive landscape perspective, actually, what I want you to hear is that CNH is an important customer of Trimble. And so we expect that relationship to continue to go forward in a positive light, and that's been -- that's consistent with the signals that we've received thus far.\nOperator: We have our next question from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJasonCelino: Can we talk about this $200 million venture fund? Should we think of these as moon shots? I mean how does it fit in your Connect & Scale initiatives? And then with the business leader from e-Builder kind of co-leading in, is this going to be more targeted towards the Construction side?\nRobPainter: Jason, so the -- I'll say the thesis behind Trimble ventures is twofold. It's to accelerate platform investments as well as the technology ecosystem. So from a technology ecosystem, think about emerging technologies that could relate to augmented reality. It could be in blockchain. It could be in IoT or autonomy. And that plays across all of Trimble potentially. And then from a platform perspective, Connect & Scale is synonymous with an industry platform strategy. And so I'll use the two interchangeably. We want this venture fund to participate with companies who can be part of the Trimble platform and extend the customer value and value proposition. And that also we could see playing across the breadth of Trimble. Having Ron Antevy, who comes from the e-Builder business we think is a great thing, because he is a lifelong entrepreneur who plugged into the bigger company at Trimble, and we think he's got the right, the mindset and the network to help companies succeed inside the Trimble platform.\nJasonCelino: Okay. Great. And then one, if I can sneak in for David. It sounds like the lower discounting is being able to offset some of the higher product cost but sounds like its still a lot of kind of a negative net impact with the mix. I guess, can you maybe provide a little more color on the level of discounting change versus the higher cost?\nDavidBarnes: Jason, first thing I'd point out is that the significant majority of the impact, both on the cost and pricing side, isn't yet reflected in Q2. Its much more of the impact is in the back half of the year. We have been ratcheting down our discounting from the old prices already for a couple of quarters now. And the way to think about it is that, that ongoing reduction in discounting was sufficient to offset the cost -- most of the cost increases we had in the quarter. For the back half of the year, what's going to happen is that much more of the cost increases we're seeing for our hardware products, some of which, by the way we believe are -- majority of which we believe are temporary in nature and they're related to the dislocation of the overall supply chain. But those are kicking in, in full force now here as we entered the third quarter. We are taking top line price increases across essentially all of our hardware offerings that are impacted by the cost increases. Those kick in gradually with slightly different approaches and timing from business to business. Overall, our outlook is that the top line price increases in the second half will offset most, but not all of the cost increase, but it will be reasonably close for the full year.\nOperator: We have our next question from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.\nColinRusch: Could you give us a bit more detail on the bundled offerings, the scope of those customers, the potential for follow-ons anything around the individual end markets that are really leading the way? I just want to get a sense of where that traction is, and how it might accelerate?\nRobPainter: Colin, it's Rob. So we work backwards from the Connect & Scale strategy and the platform strategy. And we think about the bundled offerings and how they can be in service of delivering a greater value proposition to our customers. The primary places where we're seeing the fruits of -- the early fruits of the efforts are in Construction and to a lesser extent in Transportation. And we are measuring that success or we'll measure cross-sell ACV internally, and we'll measure new logos for proof points that we're creating success. And we're listening to our customers. And our customers are telling us that this is how they want to do business with us and that they want to see us connect to many of the point solutions that we have together to provide really workflow productivity. So I'm quite encouraged that we're heading in the right direction here with Connect & Scale, and I'm encouraged that its potential really across a great deal of our portfolio.\nColinRusch: Okay. That's helpful. And then we'd love to get a better sense of this Infrastructure Bill that just is getting released with over $100 billion in -- might earmark for the roads and bridges. How that potentially is different for Trimble versus past bills? And what you're expecting given kind of the first read on what's in there?\nRobPainter:\nOperator: We have our next question from Chad Dillard from Bernstein.\nChadDillard: So I wanted to dig into the Agriculture investment that you talked about that you're increasing. Can you just give a little more color on that? And could you just rank order what the priorities are for that business right now?\nRobPainter: So when we look at the Agriculture business and think about the priority investments, our leadership for going on decades now has been in the guidance side of the business. So think of the controls and guidance. We will continue to invest in that business to keep us as the leader in guidance technology. So we're increasing our level of investment there. And think positioning technologies, think about ubiquity of coverage around the world with the positioning or correction services we have, the fast convergence that we can provide to farmers to get that high level accuracy. Think about position under canopy to provide better outcomes for farmers for positioning. So we will continue to invest in the guidance side of the business.  If I move next to the Precision side of the business, I think flow controls variable rate, which we see as the next really growth frontier within the agriculture market. We've been investing in this for a long time. The Mueller acquisition we did a few years ago really brought us forward into this space, and we continue to see attractive opportunities there. And then the 2 other areas I would put would be autonomy. And our autonomy efforts we are developing really in the core part of Trimble that serves construction end markets and agriculture end markets. So we could eliminate redundancy and duplication of efforts by serving multiple markets. So efforts in autonomy are important to us. And by way of example, the HORSCH relationship that was announced as it puts credibility behind the efforts we have there. And then finally, I would look at the software side of the Agriculture business and the bundling. It's more than just a bundling. But if we look at the software capabilities within agriculture, it's really that operational dashboard, an operational management system for a farm, and we believe deeply in the connection of what we're doing in the office and the field, the software to hardware to physical to digital, making it easier for the farmers to buy the software, the services and the hardware together. So there's efforts in that front.\nChadDillard: That's helpful. And then can you just help me think through the incremental margins in the back half of the year? Am I very rough back of the envelope math, it sounds like it could be a little bit negative. So can you just walk through just the puts and takes on net price, quantifying materials, logistics cost? And then just like how quickly do you think you can raise price and push that through to your customers?\nDavidBarnes: Chad, it's David. Let me offer a few observations. So as you think about the dynamics in the back half, it's safe to say that the cost impact will hit faster than our price increases. So I said we would offset most, but not all of the cost increase with pricing in the back half. And just the logic of that says gross margins will be under more pressure in Q3 and Q4. Another dynamic impacting the gross margin line is the mix of the business. We saw a pretty big spike up with 47% Hardware growth, which comes in at lower gross margins, and that will abate it a bit. So that -- those are the key drivers on the gross margin line. OpEx is going up for the reasons that Rob mentioned and a few others. In part, we're restoring normalcy to compensation base and bonus compensation. We're really, really unusually low last year, and we're hitting our targets this year. So that accounts for about half of the OpEx increase that we expect. And the remainder is a function of the investments Rob mentioned and other costs that go up as our revenue grows.  We -- margins will be impacted -- have been impacted and will be impacted by the subscription transition. It will be a little more than 150 basis points in the back half of the year. So all of that complicated math gets you to a point where we now think operating margins for the full year will be roughly comparable to 2020. And you might recall, last time we said they would be between '19 and '20. But with the bigger revenue than we anticipated last time we're getting more fixed cost leverage. So hopefully, that points you to most of the items you need.\nOperator: We have our next question from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.\nErikLapinski: This is Erik on for Meta. Maybe if we could just dive a bit into the bounce back you're seeing in your perpetual software business. I'm wondering if any of the strength or some of those products are tied to hardware products? And if so, to that point, could there be some headwinds to that business if hardware is seeing supply chain bottlenecks?\nDavidBarnes: Erik, it's David. You're right. The meaningful majority of our perpetual software is sold together with hardware. So that's been a good news story. We do, by the way, continue to anticipate that hardware revenue will grow just year-on-year, just not as much as it did in the second quarter, and we do anticipate lower sequential revenue in the back half versus the front half. So that will have a direct correlating impact on perpetual software.\nErikLapinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then if I could squeeze in another one. As we think about some of the perpetual sales coming back, and I know, ultimately, longer term the goal is to convert as much of the portfolio to subscription as possible. Is there a strategy around some of these products that are still sold on a perpetual basis? Or do they kind of fall in the category of the likely continue to be purchased on a perpetual basis?\nRobPainter: Erik, this is Rob. I'll give you an example on our Civil Construction business. We have an offering we call Trimble Platform-as-a-Service, where you can get a technology assurance by subscribing to the machine control and guidance solution. And when we sell that, that sells with software that comes along with it and actually a richer software offering also can bundle some office software with that. We have examples, and a few they're not needle movers, but some examples in agriculture, where some of the large enterprise farms are buying what we refer to as everything as a service. So we do have examples in the business where -- call them, whether it's a onetime sale or what would look like perpetual can become ratable with it. And it works -- so we believe it works so long as you're providing a compelling value proposition and the root of that compelling value proposition and construction is around technology assurance. So we will continue to push that forward. We've been really in North America in Civil Construction, and that will now start to go out to more of a global model. And then if we look at the software that goes along with the hardware that you were just asking about, we also see opportunities that even for hardware that continues to sell as a onetime sale that those -- that perpetual software that goes along with it, much of that does, we think have an opportunity to go ratable over time. It could be a --\nErikLapinski: It's very helpful. Congrats on the quarter.\nRobPainter: Thanks, Erik.\nOperator: We have our next question from Gal Munda from Berenberg.\nGalMunda: The first one was just maybe touch a little bit on the dynamics of the bookings growth versus the ARR growth. When I look at your split and the commentary around different segment results, both in Buildings and Infrastructure and Transportation, you're noting that bookings are actually growing faster than ARR. What's driving the dynamic? Is it kind of maybe in Transportation still the churn that's kind of leaking out there? Or is it duration? Or is it just the fact that it's kind of more upfront licenses that's kind of providing the bookings growth ahead of the ARR?\nRobPainter: Gal, it's Rob. The bookings growth ahead of ARR growth, actually, I see is very virtuous in the business. And the bookings is, of course, going to precede ARR. So I look at the bookings growth that we're having as proof points that the strategy is working, both the strategy for individual products we have, proof points that the macros are there, the fundamentals are there for the underlying businesses, proof points that the bundling efforts are working. Proof points that we're driving new logo growth. Proof points as well, Gal, I'll give you a specific example.  When we see -- we keep seeing when we have models that transition from perpetual to subscription that we're increasing the size of the addressable market. So our architecture and design business, for example, had yet another quarter of over 50% ARR growth. That's 6 quarters in a row. That doesn't happen unless you are expanding the size of the addressable market. Those growth rates exceed what we had before the model conversion. So that's going to show up in a booking growth before it shows up in ARR, that's exactly how I would want to see this play out in the business. So I'm very encouraged by seeing that dynamic.\nGalMunda: Okay. Perfect. So that there is the upside to the ARR growth effectively in the --\nRobPainter: Exactly.\nGalMunda: That's good.\nRobPainter: The timing of when that bookings growth translates into the ARR. So you connected the dots correctly.\nGalMunda: Yes. Absolutely. Okay. That makes sense. And then last quarter, when we talked a little bit about the supply chain issues and the headwind to the growth, I think we're saying the reason why you didn't raise the guidance more last quarter was because of that. Is there -- now you've obviously raised the guidance quite significantly after the first half. How much is this still kind of providing, how much is it putting breaks on your growth? Or how much could you grow if supply wasn't an issue but kind of demand would allow you to grow faster than you think you are. Can you quantify that still?\nDavidBarnes: Gal, it's David. Let me start with a couple of perspectives. Demand was more robust in Q2 than we thought a quarter ago. We also were able to squeeze more out of the supply chain than we thought we would a quarter ago. I'd point you to the comments we made about our hardware backlog. So in a normal year, hardware backlog at the end of Q2 would be about $100 million. That's what we had a year ago. We actually saw it creep up as the supply chain issues began to show themselves in Q1. It was about $200 million. Now we're at $300 million. So the simple way to think about it is that an awful lot of that $300 million or the $200 million increment above a normal level is what customers want that our supply chain isn't letting us get to them. And I'd love to say we're going to get through all of that in the back half of the year. But if you look through the guidance comments, you'll note that we're projecting that we think we'll end the year with backlog somewhere about where it is now. So we're -- our lead times on some products are longer than we or our customers would like, and we're working through it. But it's a interesting situation. We're not unique in facing these challenges. We've worked through it much better than we thought, but it will be -- it will constrain the growth we otherwise could have in the back half.\nOperator: We have our next question from Rob Mason from Baird.\nRobMason: First question was just around your operating expenses. You had noted as you go into the back half of the year, the second half, 150 to 200 basis points around your growth investments as those are increasing. Would -- should we think that those are still scaling up as we exit the year and presumably, those will carry over into next year? That's one question. And then relatedly, just around your compensation normalizing after the measures you took last year. I'm just curious if there's anything around the incentive side that we should think about perhaps resetting or resetting at a different level, lower level next year as well?\nDavidBarnes: Yes. Rob, it's David. Let me frame this a little bit. If you sort of go through the outlook we gave on gross margins and operating margins, you'll see that we expect for the year operating expense to be up about $130 million plus or minus for the year. About half of that is relating to restoring compensation to a normal level, and we are beating our own benchmarks. So that will improve -- that increases comp in a way that would likely normalize next year. The remainder of it is partly just the normal cost of growth and then about 20% or so of the $130 million is relating to the growth initiatives. I'll probably look to Rob for commentary, but I will say, I think using Rob's word, this is a long game, and we're engaged in a multiyear effort to create and exploit these platforms, the digital transformation where we have underway. The spending by no means will be over, that's not what we're signaling this year. We will be spending against those initiatives next year and thereafter.\nRobMason: I see. Okay. Just maybe a follow-up. Around the Geospatial business, in particular, obviously, very strong rebound off last year. But kind of noticing that across the industry as well. And historically, I know, Rob, you've talked about that perhaps being the most penetrated vertical or area you sell into from a technology perspective. So I'm just curious if there's -- is there anything changing around the technology side? I know you yourselves have some new products there. But is there anything changing in the industry around the technology? Or is there possibly your customers or channel trying to get out in front of what may be coming from an infrastructure side?\nRobPainter: Yes. Good question, Rob. I see 3 things happening in the market. I see the new product introduction. I see channel excellence, and I see positive macros. The team did an outstanding job in the quarter. They've done an outstanding job really over the last couple of years, couldn't be more proud of what this group of colleagues is doing because they are defying the messaging I've had in the past about the nature of growth potential in the market. And I'll follow the numbers that are published, we are outgrowing our competitors and peers in the market in this business. Now we'll eventually lap this and those numbers will get hard.  On the new product introduction side, I'd say a couple of things. Yes, we have been mentioning many of the products that the team and the cadence that they've had here over time. And that does, let's say, create a replacement cycle opportunities. So whether we're talking our X7 Laser Scanner, we've got a new mobile mapping system, there are -- our R2 GNSS system, the TSC5 handheld data collector, these are all driving excellent business. And this business was actually well positioned in context of supply chain constraints because when you have new products coming to market, you're buying components well ahead of that. So that's the new product introduction side.  The second on channel excellence, really kudos to the sales leadership and channel development team who works with our global dealer partners, all of them, I think, are becoming more and more professional in how they run and manage their businesses and how they think about segmenting markets and addressing opportunities. And then finally, the macros. Clearly, macro such as residential and infrastructure are driving very positive benefits for this business. We saw oil and gas do better in the quarter. So in places like Texas, they were buying. I'll say, they were buying again. So we saw some growth in that in the quarter as well. And we look at those macros, Rob, not only for the current sales of the surveying mapping products within Geospatial, but we look at the correlation of how that might connect to the civil construction products that would be downstream of that from a workflow perspective. And so that gives us conviction in and hope of an Infrastructure Bill getting passed that that is a sign, an early sign of potential in our other -- some of our other businesses.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over back to Michael Leyba of Investor Relations.\nMichael Leyba: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the safe harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2 with the key messages we want to convey today. In the second quarter, our team delivered outstanding results. We exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.35 billion, up 11% year-over-year, total revenue growth of 29%, EBITDA margin of 26.4% and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $798 million. We achieved record levels of revenue in many of our businesses, with exceptionally strong performance in machine control in civil construction, guidance in Agriculture and Survey in Mapping. Our results demonstrate the quality of our strategy and our business model. On the basis of this strength, we are raising our guidance for the year. Turning to market conditions. The overall landscape is generally robust. Construction backlog is healthy, especially in residential and infrastructure. We remain optimistic that an Infrastructure Bill will ultimately be passed in the United States, which would further improve our long-term outlook in our Construction and Surveying businesses. In Agriculture and Forestry, commodity price strength is translating into customer buying power. In Transportation, market strength has shifted back to carriers and this, in addition to improved execution, is translating into solid bookings growth. As discussed last quarter, we are investing in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure and are stepping up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble Cloud Platform and our autonomy efforts. Our team is highly focused on executing our Connect & Scale 2025 strategy, which centers on building leading industry cloud platforms. Our strategy differentiates at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds. As an example, our hardware businesses allow us to capture data and execute work in the field, while improving the efficiency and efficacy of workflows between the office and the field. At Trimble, we develop our strategies with an endgame backwards mindset. We balance short-term and long-term deliverables with our 3, 4, 3 operating model, 3 months, 4 quarters, 3 years. This is worth noting as quarterly comparables are skewed with COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions. We have to be able to see through the performance of any given quarter and play the long game, which we continue to believe presents a compelling secular opportunity. We are focused on metrics such as ARR, backlog, EBITDA and cash flow as much as we focus on revenue and EPS. The combination of these metrics presents a more holistic picture of our performance.  Let's turn next to Page 3 for some proof points that the Trimble Operating System, capturing strategy, people and execution is producing results. Starting with strategy. We continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities. In Buildings and Infrastructure, our structural steel, concrete, mechanical, electrical and plumbing businesses are hitting their stride with their business model transformations. Bookings, ARR growth and new logo wins are evidence that the team is expanding the addressable market. In Transportation, our recurring bookings were up significantly year-over-year, also evidence that the conversion is working. On the divestiture front, we closed the sale of Manhattan Software in the second quarter and IRON Solutions early in the third quarter. Since January of 2020, we have divested or exited 8 businesses. We are focused on building our industry-leading and cloud-connected technology platforms that enable customers to transform workflows by connecting Trimble and third-party capabilities. On people, I'm pleased to report that our leadership team was recognized by our employee base as one of the top leadership teams in a Global Culture Survey. We were also recognized as a top-performing company for women and diversity. And our engineering team ranked as a global leading team. I'm proud of my colleagues and our purpose-driven culture. It's this team that is transforming the way the world works. In addition, we strengthened our Board of Directors with the announcement that Ann Fandozzi will join our Board in the next couple of weeks. On execution, we continue to innovate. During the quarter, we announced an autonomy partnership with HORSCH. We extended our machine control platform to soil compactors and we introduced our infrastructure BIM collaboration software in North America. In addition, one of the proof points we monitor is cross-sell annual contract value. Early wins in Construction and Transportation increase our conviction that we are on the right track with our bundled offerings. Turning to Page 4. I'm excited to announce that earlier today, we launched Trimble Ventures, our corporate venture capital arm, with a commitment of $200 million of capital. Our objective is to co-invest in Series A through Series D rounds in emerging technologies as well as in companies that will extend our industry platforms. Our co-heads of Trimble Ventures include our Treasurer, Phil Sawarynsky; and Ron Antevy, Co-Founder of our e-Builder business. In closing, it was the second quarter last year where we faced the initial and biggest uncertainty with COVID-19. While the virus and its variants remain highly concerning around the world, I want to step back and reflect on an early principle we established, which is we said we would emerge from the pandemic on a stronger relative competitive footing than when we entered the pandemic. Our results demonstrate we are doing exactly this. My gratitude to my 11,000-plus Trimble colleagues and our global partners and customers, we've got this. David, over to you. The total ARR growth for the combination of Viewpoint and e-Builder was 17% in the quarter year-over-year. As it relates to new logos, we had actually strong performance in the quarter on new logo bookings. So it's a good sign that the Connect & Scale strategy is bearing fruit inside of Construction. Well, to set context for the competitive landscape, let's start with the macros in the agriculture market. As we all know, it's -- the commodity prices are high, and that is fueling a positive farmer net income. So there's an attractive backdrop against that, farmer sentiment is high, new machine sales are strong. So the place to start is at the top level with the market conditions that are positive. And you see that playing through the results in the Resources and Utility segment, and the team did a really nice job in the quarter and really through of this year.  From a competitive landscape perspective, actually, what I want you to hear is that CNH is an important customer of Trimble. And so we expect that relationship to continue to go forward in a positive light, and that's been -- that's consistent with the signals that we've received thus far. Jason, so the -- I'll say the thesis behind Trimble ventures is twofold. It's to accelerate platform investments as well as the technology ecosystem. So from a technology ecosystem, think about emerging technologies that could relate to augmented reality. It could be in blockchain. It could be in IoT or autonomy. And that plays across all of Trimble potentially. And then from a platform perspective, Connect & Scale is synonymous with an industry platform strategy. And so I'll use the two interchangeably. We want this venture fund to participate with companies who can be part of the Trimble platform and extend the customer value and value proposition. And that also we could see playing across the breadth of Trimble. Having Ron Antevy, who comes from the e-Builder business we think is a great thing, because he is a lifelong entrepreneur who plugged into the bigger company at Trimble, and we think he's got the right, the mindset and the network to help companies succeed inside the Trimble platform. Colin, it's Rob. So we work backwards from the Connect & Scale strategy and the platform strategy. And we think about the bundled offerings and how they can be in service of delivering a greater value proposition to our customers. The primary places where we're seeing the fruits of -- the early fruits of the efforts are in Construction and to a lesser extent in Transportation. And we are measuring that success or we'll measure cross-sell ACV internally, and we'll measure new logos for proof points that we're creating success. And we're listening to our customers. And our customers are telling us that this is how they want to do business with us and that they want to see us connect to many of the point solutions that we have together to provide really workflow productivity. So I'm quite encouraged that we're heading in the right direction here with Connect & Scale, and I'm encouraged that its potential really across a great deal of our portfolio. Operator: We have our next question from Chad Dillard from Bernstein. So when we look at the Agriculture business and think about the priority investments, our leadership for going on decades now has been in the guidance side of the business. So think of the controls and guidance. We will continue to invest in that business to keep us as the leader in guidance technology. So we're increasing our level of investment there. And think positioning technologies, think about ubiquity of coverage around the world with the positioning or correction services we have, the fast convergence that we can provide to farmers to get that high level accuracy. Think about position under canopy to provide better outcomes for farmers for positioning. So we will continue to invest in the guidance side of the business.  If I move next to the Precision side of the business, I think flow controls variable rate, which we see as the next really growth frontier within the agriculture market. We've been investing in this for a long time. The Mueller acquisition we did a few years ago really brought us forward into this space, and we continue to see attractive opportunities there. And then the 2 other areas I would put would be autonomy. And our autonomy efforts we are developing really in the core part of Trimble that serves construction end markets and agriculture end markets. So we could eliminate redundancy and duplication of efforts by serving multiple markets. So efforts in autonomy are important to us. And by way of example, the HORSCH relationship that was announced as it puts credibility behind the efforts we have there. And then finally, I would look at the software side of the Agriculture business and the bundling. It's more than just a bundling. But if we look at the software capabilities within agriculture, it's really that operational dashboard, an operational management system for a farm, and we believe deeply in the connection of what we're doing in the office and the field, the software to hardware to physical to digital, making it easier for the farmers to buy the software, the services and the hardware together. So there's efforts in that front. Erik, this is Rob. I'll give you an example on our Civil Construction business. We have an offering we call Trimble Platform-as-a-Service, where you can get a technology assurance by subscribing to the machine control and guidance solution. And when we sell that, that sells with software that comes along with it and actually a richer software offering also can bundle some office software with that. We have examples, and a few they're not needle movers, but some examples in agriculture, where some of the large enterprise farms are buying what we refer to as everything as a service. So we do have examples in the business where -- call them, whether it's a onetime sale or what would look like perpetual can become ratable with it. And it works -- so we believe it works so long as you're providing a compelling value proposition and the root of that compelling value proposition and construction is around technology assurance. So we will continue to push that forward. We've been really in North America in Civil Construction, and that will now start to go out to more of a global model. And then if we look at the software that goes along with the hardware that you were just asking about, we also see opportunities that even for hardware that continues to sell as a onetime sale that those -- that perpetual software that goes along with it, much of that does, we think have an opportunity to go ratable over time. It could be a -- Thanks, Erik. Gal, it's Rob. The bookings growth ahead of ARR growth, actually, I see is very virtuous in the business. And the bookings is, of course, going to precede ARR. So I look at the bookings growth that we're having as proof points that the strategy is working, both the strategy for individual products we have, proof points that the macros are there, the fundamentals are there for the underlying businesses, proof points that the bundling efforts are working. Proof points that we're driving new logo growth. Proof points as well, Gal, I'll give you a specific example.  When we see -- we keep seeing when we have models that transition from perpetual to subscription that we're increasing the size of the addressable market. So our architecture and design business, for example, had yet another quarter of over 50% ARR growth. That's 6 quarters in a row. That doesn't happen unless you are expanding the size of the addressable market. Those growth rates exceed what we had before the model conversion. So that's going to show up in a booking growth before it shows up in ARR, that's exactly how I would want to see this play out in the business. So I'm very encouraged by seeing that dynamic. Exactly. The timing of when that bookings growth translates into the ARR. So you connected the dots correctly. Yes. Good question, Rob. I see 3 things happening in the market. I see the new product introduction. I see channel excellence, and I see positive macros. The team did an outstanding job in the quarter. They've done an outstanding job really over the last couple of years, couldn't be more proud of what this group of colleagues is doing because they are defying the messaging I've had in the past about the nature of growth potential in the market.

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Let's start on 5 with a review of second quarter results. Second quarter revenue was $945 million, up 29% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3% and divestitures subtracted 1% for a total organic revenue increase of 27%. Customer demand was healthy, rebounding across all of our end markets at a rate stronger than we anticipated. Gross margin in the second quarter was 58.2%. Gross margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by the shift in mix in our business, with a higher percentage of hardware this quarter and the onset of product cost inflation given the disruptions we are seeing in our supply chain, partially offset by lower discounting. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, up 70 basis points, driven by higher revenue. Operating income margins expanded 110 basis points to 24.2%. As expected, our operating costs were up meaningfully from the second quarter of last year, when we had unusually low compensation expense and a very tight focus on cost control in light of the COVID lockdowns. Net income increased by 40%, and earnings per share increased by $0.20 to $0.72 per share. Our second quarter cash flow from operations was $201 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $190 million. Our net debt decreased over $225 million in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1. At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.25 billion available on our revolving credit facility and approximately $484 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and inorganically. Turning now to Slide 6. I'll review in a bit more detail our second quarter revenue trends. As noted earlier, our ARR was up 11% in the quarter, with organic ARR growth of approximately 10%. Excluding our Transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a high teens rate in the quarter. Encouragingly, ARR trends in Transportation improved with segment organic ARR approximately flat versus a year earlier. Our nonrecurring revenue streams experienced strong growth relative to the second quarter of 2020, during which our business was most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 shutdowns. Our Hardware revenue grew 47% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in Civil Construction, Geospatial and Agriculture. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 23%. In Europe, revenues were up 41%. Currency fluctuations positively impacted growth in Europe by about 9%, with the balance coming from catch up on project activity, which has slowed in 2020, fiscal stimulus measures and recovering demand in many end markets. Asia Pacific grew 19% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in Australia and New Zealand. The Rest of World, which includes Brazil and Argentina, was up 49% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the other key metrics that we follow. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 2% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Our deferred revenue grew 14% year-over-year. An important story this quarter is the growth of our backlog. Total backlog at quarter end was approximately $1.5 billion. Of that total, approximately $300 million relates to unfilled orders for hardware products. This compares with hardware backlog of about $100 million at the end of the second quarter last year, which is a more typical level for our business. In this time of both exceptionally strong customer demand and increasing supply chain pressures, our operations team did an extraordinary job, which enabled our record year-on-year Hardware revenue growth of 47%. Turning now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 22% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our Building and Civil Construction businesses, with Hardware revenue across the segment up greater than 40%. Segment margins were down 40 basis points, due primarily to revenue mix. Across our recurring software offerings in this segment, bookings were strong, up approximately 25% versus a year ago. Geospatial revenue was up 48% on an organic basis. We saw a rebound in demand across nearly all of the end markets for our Geospatial offerings, and our new products are generating significant customer enthusiasm. Operating margins were up 430 basis points due to strong revenue growth and the success of new products. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 32% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in Precision Agriculture and Positioning Services. Margins expanded 160 basis points. Top line results in Transportation met our expectations. Revenue was up 9% on an organic basis year-on-year. The drivers of revenue growth were improved trends in both our mobility and enterprise businesses. Margins declined 170 basis points on a year-over-year basis due to increased mix of low-margin hardware and increased operating costs, but margins improved sequentially over first quarter levels. We remain confident that we are on track for continued sequential improvement as the year progresses. Turning now to our outlook for the full year. Our performance in the second quarter and the strength of our backlog give us the visibility and confidence to raise our outlook for the year. I'll point out that supply chain constraints continue to present us with meaningful uncertainty as the availability of some critical components remains unpredictable. The outlook I'll describe represents our best sense of this dynamic environment. I'll also point out that comparisons versus the quarters of 2020 are difficult to draw meaning from as the impact of the onset of COVID and the recovery following market reopenings created large swings last year. We will focus more on sequential evolution from the second quarter through to the second half.  We are raising our outlook for the full year revenue to between $3.55 billion and $3.65 billion. Demand remains resilient across all of our end markets, but our Hardware revenues will likely be constrained by our ability to source key components. Note that this new revenue range incorporates our divestitures, including the recent divestitures of our Manhattan Software and IRON Solutions businesses. Divestitures will reduce our revenue growth in 2021 by a little over 100 basis points, but are reflective of our increasing focus on platforms, which connect the workflows in RT end markets. Sequentially, we expect that revenue in the second half will be well above 2020 levels, but below the levels we realized in the first half of 2021. The expectation of lower revenue in the second half versus the first half is entirely driven by constraints in our supply chain. We expect to end the year with hardware backlog at levels similar to the end of the second quarter. Given our strong bookings trends across our recurring software businesses, we expect organic ARR growth of approximately 10% for the full year. We anticipate that second half gross margins will be down approximately 50 to 100 basis points below second half 2020 margins, due to the net impact of product mix and cost pressures, partially offset by price increases. We are implementing price increases across many of the product lines impacted by the recent inflationary spike. But overall, the net impact on gross margins will still be adverse year-over-year for both the back half and full year 2021. We expect to experience the greatest gross margin pressure in the third quarter as we won't realize the full benefit of our price increases until the fourth quarter.  Our outlook for operating margins has improved as the leverage from higher revenue more than offsets the impact of mix shift, increasing product cost inflation and the investments we are making in support of our strategy. We now expect that operating margin for the full year 2021 will be comparable to 2020. Note that our software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring are accelerating in the back half of this year. These transitions will adversely impact operating margins by 150 to 200 basis points in the second half of 2021.  Our outlook for full year earnings per share has increased to $2.45 to $2.65 per share. From a cash flow perspective, given our strong performance in the first half of 2021, we expect cash flow from operations for the full year of greater than 1.1x non-GAAP net income, with free cash flow comfortably exceeding non-GAAP net income. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Jason, first thing I'd point out is that the significant majority of the impact, both on the cost and pricing side, isn't yet reflected in Q2. Its much more of the impact is in the back half of the year. We have been ratcheting down our discounting from the old prices already for a couple of quarters now. And the way to think about it is that, that ongoing reduction in discounting was sufficient to offset the cost -- most of the cost increases we had in the quarter. For the back half of the year, what's going to happen is that much more of the cost increases we're seeing for our hardware products, some of which, by the way we believe are -- majority of which we believe are temporary in nature and they're related to the dislocation of the overall supply chain. But those are kicking in, in full force now here as we entered the third quarter. We are taking top line price increases across essentially all of our hardware offerings that are impacted by the cost increases. Those kick in gradually with slightly different approaches and timing from business to business. Overall, our outlook is that the top line price increases in the second half will offset most, but not all of the cost increase, but it will be reasonably close for the full year. Chad, it's David. Let me offer a few observations. So as you think about the dynamics in the back half, it's safe to say that the cost impact will hit faster than our price increases. So I said we would offset most, but not all of the cost increase with pricing in the back half. And just the logic of that says gross margins will be under more pressure in Q3 and Q4. Another dynamic impacting the gross margin line is the mix of the business. We saw a pretty big spike up with 47% Hardware growth, which comes in at lower gross margins, and that will abate it a bit. So that -- those are the key drivers on the gross margin line. OpEx is going up for the reasons that Rob mentioned and a few others. In part, we're restoring normalcy to compensation base and bonus compensation. We're really, really unusually low last year, and we're hitting our targets this year. So that accounts for about half of the OpEx increase that we expect. And the remainder is a function of the investments Rob mentioned and other costs that go up as our revenue grows.  We -- margins will be impacted -- have been impacted and will be impacted by the subscription transition. It will be a little more than 150 basis points in the back half of the year. So all of that complicated math gets you to a point where we now think operating margins for the full year will be roughly comparable to 2020. And you might recall, last time we said they would be between '19 and '20. But with the bigger revenue than we anticipated last time we're getting more fixed cost leverage. So hopefully, that points you to most of the items you need. Erik, it's David. You're right. The meaningful majority of our perpetual software is sold together with hardware. So that's been a good news story. We do, by the way, continue to anticipate that hardware revenue will grow just year-on-year, just not as much as it did in the second quarter, and we do anticipate lower sequential revenue in the back half versus the front half. So that will have a direct correlating impact on perpetual software. Gal, it's David. Let me start with a couple of perspectives. Demand was more robust in Q2 than we thought a quarter ago. We also were able to squeeze more out of the supply chain than we thought we would a quarter ago. I'd point you to the comments we made about our hardware backlog. So in a normal year, hardware backlog at the end of Q2 would be about $100 million. That's what we had a year ago. We actually saw it creep up as the supply chain issues began to show themselves in Q1. It was about $200 million. Now we're at $300 million. So the simple way to think about it is that an awful lot of that $300 million or the $200 million increment above a normal level is what customers want that our supply chain isn't letting us get to them. And I'd love to say we're going to get through all of that in the back half of the year. But if you look through the guidance comments, you'll note that we're projecting that we think we'll end the year with backlog somewhere about where it is now. So we're -- our lead times on some products are longer than we or our customers would like, and we're working through it. But it's a interesting situation. We're not unique in facing these challenges. We've worked through it much better than we thought, but it will be -- it will constrain the growth we otherwise could have in the back half. Yes. Rob, it's David. Let me frame this a little bit. If you sort of go through the outlook we gave on gross margins and operating margins, you'll see that we expect for the year operating expense to be up about $130 million plus or minus for the year. About half of that is relating to restoring compensation to a normal level, and we are beating our own benchmarks. So that will improve -- that increases comp in a way that would likely normalize next year. The remainder of it is partly just the normal cost of growth and then about 20% or so of the $130 million is relating to the growth initiatives. I'll probably look to Rob for commentary, but I will say, I think using Rob's word, this is a long game, and we're engaged in a multiyear effort to create and exploit these platforms, the digital transformation where we have underway. The spending by no means will be over, that's not what we're signaling this year. We will be spending against those initiatives next year and thereafter."

On today's call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to Rob Painter, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin.\nRob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2, with the key messages we want to convey today. In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.32 billion, up 9% year-over-year, total revenue growth of 12%, EBITDA of 26%, and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $745 million. Our results demonstrate the quality of our business model and an improving macro-economic backdrop. They also highlight the strength of our Connect and Scale 2025strategy. On the basis of this competitive strength and the nature of the opportunities we see in the market, we plan to scale up investments in targeted areas of the company. At the same time, we are also raising our guidance for the year. Turning to Page 3, in the market backdrop, the common threat across the industries we serve is delivering products and services that connect the physical and digital worlds. The industries we serve our large, global, underserved and underpenetrated with technology. As our end market digitize, we are able to connect the office and the field with our hardware and our software offerings, in a manner that delivers productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. In buildings and infrastructure, we exceeded expectations in the business, leveraging our strong market position and continuing the conversion of our business models. The segment now stands at approximately 65% software-related revenue. In geospatial, the business experienced the strongest year-over-year growth we have seen, since we created a reporting segment in 2017. Global demand is healthy and the innovation that the team has delivered has strengthened our competitive position. In transportation, we met the P&L expectations we have for the segment in the quarter. Bookings in our mobility business improved to their best level since early 2019. Bookings in our transportation enterprise software business were strong, with subscription bookings more than double the level of our first quarter 2020. We remain confident that we will deliver demonstrable improvement in revenue, margins and ARR trends in the second-half of the year. In resources and utilities, the commodity price backdrop is providing global tailwinds to the business. And we delivered growth well ahead of our expectations. Let's turn next to Page 4, for some proof points on the Trimble operating system, capturing strategy, people and execution. On strategy, we continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities, particularly design and engineering software business announced its shift to subscription that went into effect in March. Different but better, is our tagline, and I think that sums it up well, which is to say, it's more than just change its progress. Our mechanical electrical plumbing business also continued its subscription conversion, and as mentioned, we saw a strong level of recurring bookings in our transportation enterprise business. Finally, I'd like to note that we closed the divestiture of the Manhattan Real Estate Software business early in the second quarter, and we wish the team well in its new home. On people, I'm pleased to report that we ranked number 15 out of 15,000 companies in 2021 Best Global Culture survey. I also want to announce that our CTO, Tom Fansler, retires at the end of the second quarter. Two of our other business leaders, Ron and Patty and Bryn Fosburgh will assume new role starting in the third quarter. Ron will operate as an entrepreneur and residents, driving innovation efforts. And Brent will act as our Interim CTO. I'm pleased to say that we promoted from within for Ron and Brent's current responsibilities for the e-Builder and overall construction businesses, respectively. On execution, we released our sustainability report a few weeks ago. I'm incredibly proud of the work of the team on this important initiative. Our teams also continue to innovate. We launched the civil construction estimating software package, we released a combination of our LOADRITE payload management system with Earthworks Grade Control Platform. We launched a new TSC5 data controller [ph], and we released the new SX12 scanning total station, which is an update to our successful SX10 instrument. The SX12 now supports additional applications in tunneling and underground construction. With respect to increasing investment in the business, we see Connect and Scale as being synonymous with an industry platform strategy. We want to play offense and invest now for the mid- to long-term opportunities that we see in the market. We see a generational opportunity out of a North America infrastructure bill, and a strong commodity price backdrop in the agriculture market. We will invest in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure, and we'll step up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble cloud platform and our autonomy efforts. A quick update on our plans for an Investor Day, we have concluded that an in-person meeting at our Colorado facility, where much of our leadership team is based, is the best way to facilitate the kind of in-depth interaction that many of you want from an Investor Day. We will hold the meeting in the spring of 2022, by which time the environment for business travel should be greatly improved. We also plan to hold one or two interactive virtual sessions with investors on specific topics of broad interest later this year. In closing, I'm as confident and optimistic about Trimble as ever. We have the right team, pursuing a compelling strategy and attractive markets. It won't be easy, and it won't be linear, but nothing worth achieving is. David, over to you.\nDavid Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5, with a review of first quarter results. First Quarter revenue was $887 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3%, and divestitures subtracted 1%, for a total organic revenue increase of 10%. Gross margin in the first quarter was 58.4%. Margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.1%, up 340 basis points, driven both by higher revenue and strong cost control. Operating income margins expanded 330 basis points to 23.6%. Net income dollars increased by 36%, and earnings per share increased by $0.17 to $0.66 per share. The first quarter cash flow from operations was $228 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $218 million. We paid down $158 million of debt in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1.3 times. At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.2 5 billion available on our revolving credit facility, and approximately $265 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well-positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our first quarter revenue trends. As mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our non-recurring revenue streams also grew with hardware growing 17%, and perpetual software growing 11%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth also contributed to perpetual software growth, and some of our hardware offerings are bundled with perpetual software. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 9%. Excluding transportation revenues in North America grew 15%. In Europe, revenues were up 16%, roughly half of our Europe growth was driven by currency, with the balance coming from catch-up on project activities slowed in 2020, fiscal stimulus measures, and recovering demand in many end markets. Asia Pacific had the best performance in the quarter, up 17%, driven by strong growth in Australia and Japan. The rest of world, which includes Brazil and Argentina was up 5% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Annualized recurring revenue was $1.32 billion in the first quarter, up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Organic ARR growth was approximately 7%. Excluding our transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Net working capital inclusive of deferred revenue was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 1% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Research and Development on a trailing 12-month basis was 15% of revenue. Our deferred revenue grew 12% on a year-over-year basis. And our backlog excluding the impact of the real estate software business divested early in the second quarter was $1.4 billion, up 17% versus prior year. While growing backlog is obviously an indicator of strong momentum in the business. I'll note here that backlog at quarter-end was unusually high, in part because Trimble like so many manufacturers in this recovering economy is experiencing shortages and extended delivery times, for many key components of our hardware products. Our operations team is hard at work to expedite delivery of products, which are in short supply, but we do expect to manage challenges with both cost inflation and extended lead times of select hardware product lines in the quarters to come. Turning now to Slide 8, for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and infrastructure revenue was up 13% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our building and civil construction businesses. Segment margins were up 760 basis points, due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 22% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment business. Margins were up 590 basis points due to strong revenue growth and cost control. Resources and utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis. We experienced double digit growth in each of our precision agriculture, positioning services and agriculture software offerings. Margins expanded 190 basis points driven by increased revenue and cost control. Top-line results in transportation were consistent with our expectations. Revenue was down 6% on an organic basis year-on-year, and margins declined 450 basis points. The drivers of revenue and margin decline are broadly consistent with those we have highlighted previously. Revenue and margins were roughly stable sequentially, when compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and leading indicators provide encouraging signs for the recovery ahead. As Rob mentioned, bookings were very strong in both our mobility and enterprise software businesses. Our product performance is improving, and our sales pipeline is stronger than it has been in nearly two years. We remain confident that we are on track to improve performance later this year. Moving to Slide 9, I'll provide an update to our outlook for the year. Given our outperformance in the first quarter, our growing backlog and increasing confidence in our business trends, we are raising our revenue forecast range by $100 million to $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. I'll note here that the biggest risk we have to our revenue outlook for the next couple of quarters is the supply environment for critical hardware components. We expect that revenue growth will be strongest in the second quarter, as we lap the worst period of the COVID lockdowns in 2020, with more moderate growth in the back-half of the year, and especially in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect organic ARR growth in the high single digits with improving trends as the year progresses. From a profitability perspective, we continue to expect that EBITDA margins will come in between the levels of 2019 and 2020. Margins for the balance of 2021, and especially in the second-half of the year, are likely to come down from the levels we achieved in the first quarter for a number of reasons. First, we expect some operating expense acceleration as the year progresses and the environment for business travel opens up. Second, we are accelerating investments that Rob mentioned earlier. These investments include spending on our digital transformation and cloud infrastructure, and higher R&D on our autonomy projects, and our agricultural product offerings. And third, we are seeing growing cost pressure in our hardware costs of goods, across a broad range of commodities. We are adapting our pricing and discounting strategies to reflect these cost pressures, but still anticipate some adverse impact on our gross margins. We continue to expect that software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring will impact revenue growth and operating margins by approximately 150 basis points. Our earnings per share outlook is raised to $2.30 to $2.50. This reflects the revenue and operating margin trends, I mentioned earlier, and a modestly higher tax rate outlook than we had anticipated a quarter ago. From a cash flow perspective, we spent cash flow from operations of approximately 1.1 times net income, with free cash flow exceeding net income. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAnn Duignan: Yes. Could you provide some more color on your gross margins through the remainder of the year, and the impact of higher costs, whether those are just stem, the inability to get supply or, higher material costs going forward? Just would like to get a sense of what's more permanent versus what's temporary? And then could you dig a little deeper into your increased investments, particularly in agriculture? And, the digital et cetera, I think those are probably not surprising, but just dig a little bit deeper into both of those please. Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: Hi, Ann, this is David. I'll take the first part of your question on gross margins. I'll say the environment for product cost has changed a lot, just in the last month or two. And it's a fluid situation, so it's hard to make specific predictions. I will say that the product inflation that we're facing really only began toward the end of Q1. So the results that we just reported don't reflect the full impact we anticipate later this year. And you saw our gross margins declined year-on-year about 70 basis points, and probably just under half of that can be accounted counted for in product cost increases. But we're seeing increases across the board. Obviously, we're all reading about semiconductor tight supply and cost increases, but we're really seeing it across a whole broad range of commodities, in transportation, particularly air transportation that we use to get our products where we need them to go. So, without getting too specific, I'll say that we do expect underlying cost of goods inflation for the balance of the year to be noticeably higher than it was in Q1. Now, I'll comment that we're adapting, as I mentioned in the script, our discounting strategy and our top-line prices, and we hope to accommodate a meaningful portion of the impact of the costs increases, but nonetheless, we expect gross margins will come down for that reason, in the remaining three quarters of the year. And then, I'll turn over to Rob for your questions about operating expense and the investments we\u2019re making.\nRob Painter: Hi, Ann. So, I mentioned that Connect and Scale specific strategy is synonymous with the platform strategy and the nucleus, an agriculture market for us is the crop production workflow. So the stepped up investments we're making in agriculture hit areas of that platform that include autonomy, includes our software, includes our correction services, and continuing to build out the networks around that. And then finally, localization efforts, it is the majority of our business these days is outside North America.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. And just quickly to follow-up, how much demand is there really, for the connected farm for the entire software package across the entire enterprise? I think, of farmers as wanting individual packages from different suppliers. And so, I'm just curious, what you're seeing out there in the marketplace from a connected farm perspective?\nDavid Barnes: Our technology is on over 150 million acres of farm today, that's primarily the hardware, the guidance systems. We have about 20% of that same acreage covered with our software. So, it's not -- this isn't new, let's say it's been in motion for a long time. I see the delta of the 80% is a potentially addressable market, obviously, we won't serve 100% of that. The other way to look at it, Ann, that's a software hardware connection. The other way to look at it as from a correction services perspective. So we have well over 100,000 users of our correction services today. And the connected farm that is an aspect. So when the scale part of Connect and Scale is about making ourselves easier to do business with, and bringing that software, the hardware and the services together at the point of sale. So, we think there is a demand for a market.\nAnn Duignan: Okay, I'll get back in queue. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. Good afternoon. You know, it's funny, Rob, you actually touched on what I wanted to ask about in your prepared remarks, and David did too. It seems like with infrastructure bill coming down the channels, we get a lot of questions just on what that'll mean, it seems like a bit of a potential coming out party for all the transformation the industry can do with digital construction. So, I'd just love to hear any stories or any color you have on how you're preparing the organization to see themselves, what your capabilities are versus what we all kind of know, a couple of years ago? How you see that opportunity to really showcase what can be done for construction with what you have? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Rob. So, we see it as a generational opportunity. And I'll focus on North America, but highlight that places like the UK are going with construction led recovery. We see markets like Japan promoting digital technologies. Australia has strong infrastructure development as well. In North America, I think about it from the value proposition of what the technology can do. We think about the funding around that. And we mentioned that we would -- with respect to our own funding, we would step up investments in the area, and then we also think about policy. So from a value proposition perspective, with digital technology, we can build greener, we can build more inclusively, and we can build better while doing so cheaper. So it just makes sense to use the technology. What we're hearing from customers and stakeholders in the industry actually is on the policy side as well as a desire to streamline project delivery, by promoting the digital technology. So really streamlining project delivery, really seems to be the core of what the market is talking about. And from a funding perspective, I'll start with government level funding. And, we do anticipate that the final amount will be well-negotiated, and it'll be different than the proposed American jobs plan. Nevertheless, and we need to also reauthorize the surface transportation bill. So the jobs plan, in addition to the reauthorization of the surface transportation bill, we think that will be significant. We think it will be incremental to the current baseline investments in our highways, airports, mass transit, and our ports. Now, we think that won't pass until later in the year. And the benefits of that wouldn't be realized in 2022. So when we think about the investments in our business to get ahead of that, we think both at a product development level, as well as a go-to-market level. So at a product development level, where we're going with the Connect part of Connect and Scale, as integrating the hardware, the software, the physical, the digital, the office, the field, being able to round trip that data to streamline project delivery. So, we'll continue our efforts on that front. And at a go-to-market level, it's putting the resources, increase the level of resources and capabilities in place to actually execute against what we think is attractive and important opportunity.\nRob Wertheimer: That's a great answer. Thank you. And just to highlight one thing you mentioned in there, do you feel like the customer is now well educated and calling for this kind of product in a way that was different from a year ago, or five years ago? Has that changed significantly? And I will stop there. Thank you.\nRob Painter: It is changing significantly, I'd say we may not be at the point of calling it significant, it's certainly meaningful amount of change. And I think about it from a few dynamics, I'll address owners, engineers and contractors. At an owner level, think about the Department of Transportation as an owner to talk about a state DoT as an owner. I do think there's increasing awareness of the technology. They're certainly increasing awareness of the concept of the digital twin, and how this can play through the operations and maintenance phase. And if we use the technology during the design, engineering and construction phase, how that can then be leveraged in the operations and maintenance phase. So I think there is increased awareness. We see a few more projects that are promoting the use of technology. Actually, the Federal Highway Administration, they made an announcement recently to recognize as a digitalize belt [ph] is an important technology innovation. So that's helpful to see that coming from that perspective. In the engineering community, certainly, it's in the interest of the engineering community to help fill the delivery of the projects better and faster, and for them to be able to win more of the work. And then at the contractor level, I see that's where we see the most level of proactive use and request for use of technology, because the contractors are the ones who are -- they're really seeing the most tactical benefit of better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener, in their day to day work. So they're winning more work. It's becoming more just the way that construction is done. So very positive on the contractor side.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAshok Sivamohan: Hi, this is Ashok Sivamohan on for Jerry Revich. You said that buildings and infrastructure margins expanded due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. And so, I'm wondering how you're thinking about the sustainability of buildings and infrastructure margins at these levels?\nDavid Barnes: Ashok, it's David. We have a meaningful hardware business in buildings and infrastructure, so that will be impacted by the hardware dynamics, I discussed previously. And I also mentioned that overall for the company, we expect to see some operating expense pickup. I'll call some of it natural, because with COVID we had almost no business travel, we had lower incentive compensation. So that will normalize. And then the investments that we're making will be seen in the segments broadly. So those dynamics are going to put pressure on margins in all the segments, including buildings and infrastructure.\nAshok Sivamohan: Great. And in terms of the 11% growth and perpetual software revenue this quarter, I'm wondering if you can discuss which products drove the growth and our prospects for that growth to potentially continue?\nDavid Barnes: I'll say one thing, as I mentioned in my remarks, we sell a meaningful amount of perpetual software bundled with the hardware. So, when hardware grows like it did in the first quarter perpetual software grows. We are in the process of transitioning from perpetual to subscription, Rob mentioned in one of our design software offerings, and that sort of tends to precipitate perpetual software growth. So that was a piece of it. But, overall, let's remember we're comparing with the first quarter of last year when we saw particularly toward the end of the quarter, a lot of hesitancy and great uncertainty. So customers were starting to be reluctant to buy. And I think all those factors contributed to perpetual software growth.\nAshok Sivamohan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard of Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good afternoon, guys. So, I want to dig in to your guidance change on the revenue side, just hoping to get a little bit more color on the moving parts planned out from an end market perspective, as well as a regional perspective. And then also, if I look at statistical seasonality, like you usually imply like a $4 billion revenue number for the year. So I just wanted to understand, is that delta really all about the supply chain issues? Or is there something else?\nDavid Barnes: Yeah. Hey, Chad, this is David. I'll say first of all, that comparing quarter-to-quarter last year is a tough drill, because last year was so strange. And particularly as we recall Q2, we saw a rapid contraction in demand, and many of that are end markets, and then a lot of catch-up and pick up later in the year. So that's going to factor in. As far as the end markets that are driving the results, we mentioned in transportation, we ended about where we thought we would P&L wise, but bookings were up, and obviously the transportation market has picked up in terms of the macros with asset utilization and pricing and the financial solidity of our transportation customers is better. So, that's more of a tailwind for future quarters than this one. But, look beyond that, in the other three segments, we exceeded our expectations. So that's why the outlook came up in part, because Q1 was above where we thought it would be. And we think some of those trends will continue. And the caution I'll provide is that hardware still a meaningful part of our business. And for all the reasons I mentioned, with the supply chain challenges, that's creating the greatest level of uncertainty. So I don't know if that answers your questions about seasonality. We do think seasonality will be different in 2021 from 2020, for a number of reasons. And you're probably better off comparing with 2019 for a normalized year.\nChad Dillard: Got it. That's helpful. And just a question on gross margins and price costs. Just to be clear, will you be exiting the year -- will you be able to match your price with this cost? And then, you can just talk about just your ability to raise price in terms of a contractual dynamic fair as well?\nDavid Barnes: Yeah, I'll say it's a very complicated formula. We have contractual arrangements with our customers and dealers that don't facilitate an immediate increase in price in some cases. So that's a factor. With some protection of supply chain side too, but those don't necessarily match up. So, I think for Trimble and every company producing hardware, this is a rapidly moving situation. Our intention, obviously, we will remain competitive. Our intention is to recoup a meaningful portion of the increase in product costs. And I'll say, we can't have a specific estimate with high confidence in that cost. But we believe we'll get a meaningful chunk, but not all of it. And that's why we expect to see some gross margin declines, or continuing decline for the remainder of the year.\nRob Painter: And this is Rob. To add to that, as we exit the year, I think the exit path would\u2026\nDavid Barnes: That's right. I think if you look at what's happening in the world, the semiconductor side of things is going to take probably three or four, maybe five quarters to recover. Some of the other input costs are likely to abate sooner than that. For instance, air freight will get more reasonable once trans-oceanic aircraft recovers. So there are a lot of moving pieces. I don't think this is a long-term change in the trajectory of our gross margins. But, it will be with us for a few quarters.\nChad Dillard: Great. That's helpful. I'll get back into the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. This is Kristen on for Collin. Thank you for taking our questions.\nRob Painter: Sure.\nUnidentified Analyst: So nice to see some improvement in the backlog in transportation. We are obviously in a tight freight environment where carriers are making money, but also needing to bolster their ability to keep up with demand and some of the labor shortages. If we look through the noise, can you talk about some of the underlying trends in that business, as it relates to your portfolio? And how we should think about a more normalized business trend into 2022, as we comp some of these unique headwinds?\nDavid Barnes: Kristen, I'll just point out the obvious that some of the factors that have been driving our trends are somewhat unique to Trimble, in terms of the issues we had, post the ELD mandate coming into effect. And we did have some product performance issues. And so, the pullback in ARR was a consequence of that. There's no doubt that the macros in the transportation business are dramatically better than they were three to four quarters ago, and that's helpful. Our business trends won't change linearly and right away with the changes in the macro environment, with the customers that we serve experience. So it's not at all surprising to any of us that we have some lag. But, I'll say there are a number of factors that give us confidence that we're on the road back to better trends and transportation, just to highlight a few. Our churn is trending down on a secular basis, there are bumps quarter-to-quarter as individual customers implement decisions they made some time ago. But, the data truly points to a better trend there. Rob mentioned the bookings, even beyond the bookings, our sales pipeline is looking up versus where it was a quarter or two ago. The performance of our products is improving. So our teams have done a great job of resolving the product issues. And I think we're seeing broader customer receptivity through the strategy of the integrated supply chain. So we have a lot of work to do in transportation, Kristen, so we're not changing the outlook, that things will get better immediately. But, we do look to see improve trends toward the back-half of the year, and especially the fourth quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's helpful color. Thank you. And then, if I could ask a longer-term question, maybe dovetailing on a question that was asked earlier. I wanted to ask about your appetite for M&A at this stage. Historically, we think about a few points contribution every year to revenue growth. Balance Sheet is in great shape, because you're generating a ton of cash flow. But, as you're thinking about planning for these generational opportunities in infrastructure and ag, as you called out, can you talk about the M&A pipeline? Are there opportunities for more sizable investments? And maybe what's on the Trimble wish list?\nRob Painter: The short answer, Kristen is yes, that the pipeline is more active at the moment. And, certainly our areas of interest are going to be where we have the most strategic opportunity to grow and to build a platform strategy, whether that's in a construction, agriculture, or in some of our other vertical focused market. So that we feel pretty good about where we are. And as you said, the balance sheet is in a great place to be able to help us facilitate that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And your next question from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, team, this is Eric on for James. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe if we can touch more on the demand impacts of the supply chain issues you're seeing? Are you seeing any element of forward ordering and maybe that was captured in your comments around the backlog earlier? Or even just buying ahead of potential supply chain constraints in any areas of the business? Or is visibility, I guess improved would be another way to say that?\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Eric. I'll say it's a little hard to quantify when orders come through exactly whether they're for current demand or they're seeing the supply chain tighten up. I think it's a mixture of both. Our backlog, I mentioned is now up to $1.4 billion, a meaningful increase year-on-year. I'd say the increase year-on-year for the hardware piece is a mix of healthy demand and end markets, and some customers ordering before they otherwise would have. But I'll say inventory at our dealers is really low. And I think most of what you're seeing is the fact that the end markets are really healthy. And projects are picking up and customers need the product.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's extremely helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just touching on geospatial, it continues to be very strong and definitely benefiting from the construction, the recovery you guys have mentioned. How much of an element though I know you've had some product releases and refreshes. Do you I guess attribute to maybe some of that refresh cycle versus the broader macro demand?\nRob Painter: This is Rob. There's absolutely an aspect that correlates to the replacement cycle and new products that we have, whether that's on the handheld side with TSC5, or on the GNSS receiver side with our 12I. Those would be replacement examples where we're able to bring in a new instrument or tool, that's able to make the customers more productive. We've got a tighter integration of our software workflows into the hardware. So we've seen customers who are orienting their field survey crews around a Trimble workflow. So it's almost like the tail wagging the dog, where that software is driving the demand for the hardware. There's also examples of our, I'd call them new categories. So take our laser scanner, 3D laser scanner, it's an instrument called the X7. That's a market segment where we didn't historically drive as much business. So that's not a replacement market for us. That's new-new. And then I would say on the go-to-market side, the team's done an excellent job on a global distribution basis of getting our dealers in a better healthier states, and really understanding their own local go-to-market execution. So definitely a mix of both. And really, the team's done great work.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter.\nRob Painter: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question from Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is now open.\nRichard Eastman: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. Just a question around the OpEx number the $308 million number in the quarter. Could you just maybe speak to the cadence of what OpEx looks like as we move through the second through the fourth quarter? I mean, we've got some puts and takes, obviously, but trying to get a sense of how much the COVID-related expenses, or penalties, I guess how you want to call it, come back into the number? You spoke a little bit around investments there. Maybe just define that a little bit. But, that's what I'm trying to look for a little bit of guidance as to how that number plays out for the next few quarters.\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Richard its David. First thing I'll say is that in terms of what I'll call costs generated by COVID, we didn't have much. The impact of COVID on our costs was really negative. We had some costs in our cleaning our facilities and that kind of thing, but it was relatively de minimis. So we had sort of artificially low costs in a number of areas. With the revenue coming down, our incentive comp naturally reduced. We stopped traveling canceled events. And we really cut back on a lot of discretionary spending, that wasn't core to the strategy. So that's coming back. And as you look at the operating expense growth going forward, I'll put it in a handful of buckets. First of all, some of our OpEx is overseas and the U.S. dollar is weakened. So just the FX impact sort of takes up our accounts for about 20% of our OpEx increase that we expect for the balance of the year. But 60% of the increase is what I'll call go back to normal, as travel comes back, as incentive comp comes back, as we start hiring. We didn't even have our salary increase last year. So that's the normal part of things. And then about 20%, the remaining 20% of the year-on-year OpEx increase will be accounted for in higher spending in the investment areas that Rob mentioned. There a couple other things that are puts in takes, you've got some other headcount, ads and divestitures. But, hopefully that gives you a broad bucketing. And we do think year-on-year OpEx, which was about flat in Q1, it won't be flat in the remaining quarters.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. It can't be. Okay. And then Rob, maybe you could just shed some color on the BIM piece of buildings and infrastructure, either geographically or perhaps by end market. In other words, as the commercial market look firm to up versus education market, government market, it'd be just to sift through that just a little bit as to where the strength was and should continue to be?\nRob Painter: Sure. So infrastructure and residential backlogs are solid. Healthcare, data centers, logistics centers, utility and fiber optics work, that's all good. And you can look at entities such as ABI and Dodge, and they're up. We look at OEM units, those have been pretty good from both the construction and agriculture side, even mining in places like South Africa and Australia, where we have some exposure of those have been good. So that, call it that general commercial work office buildings, that's low. Education, it's actually much bigger market than one might realize. And so it's still lower, but it's still a large number. And so that's doing okay. Geographically speaking, actually, it's a pretty broad based strength. So, Japan was strong, Australia, strong. North America, strong. Western Europe, and the Nordics are strong. And we see a play through both in software, and I guess we've given you some software answer, but we see it playing through in hardware. So for instance, when residential work picks up, we don't actually have as much exposure in residential on the building software side, but it helps us on the civil side and it helps us on the geospatial business. In civil construction, we see more of the smaller building construction product type equipment. If some of that equipments using technology or concrete screens for foundation work, I mean, geospatial it's survey work. So yeah, that's what's going on.\nRichard Eastman: Yeah. In the 13% core growth for buildings and infrastructure, how much headwind was absorbed there from the SAS conversions and the growth rate there in that segment?\nDavid Barnes: Good chunk.\nRob Painter: Probably a couple points.\nDavid Barnes: Yeah.\nRichard Eastman: Okay, couple. Okay, great. Thank you. And nice start to the year for sure.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Rick.\nOperator: Next question from Gal Munda of Berenberg. Your line is now open.\nGal Munda: Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one that is just around the guidance for the rest of the year and the way you're thinking about, just to expand on the shortages issue. David, you mentioned that you expect semi shortage, for example, to take three to five quarters to really play out.  Is there a way where you kind of factored in a level of conservatism into your guidance for the rest of the year at this stage? Because you don't know whether, the supply can actually be met sorry, demand can be met with the supply that's available? And is there any sort of conservatism coming from that side? Or you don't think that's going to be an issue in meeting the demand?\nDavid Barnes: It will definitely, I think, be a constraint. And as you think about the $100 million dollar range between the bottom and the top end of the revenue guidance, the uncertainties around hardware supply account for majority of that. So, I think the scenario in which we're at the lower end of the guidance range is characterized by increasing tightness in markets for key components. And the higher end is one in which, we're able to work through the constraints. So it is a hard one to call. It's somewhat unprecedented, talking to my colleagues who've been doing this work for decades, and none of them have seen anything just like it. So we have a very adept operations team. It's one of the strengths of Trimble of being flexible and figuring out how to handle bumps in the road, like we have now. So, we're looking at this component by component and product by product, and I'll concede that there's meaningful uncertainty, and that's what's driving the range in our guidance.\nGal Munda: That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just as a second question, I'd like to spend a little bit on the guidance that you're still providing, in terms of the business model transition, which at this stage is still around 1.5 percentage points headwind to your growth. If we look kind of forward and maybe into '22, '23, like, how long does this persist for you? And how material it is going forward as well? Is there a way to think that maybe '22 and then '23, incrementally becomes less of a headwind but still is a headwind? Is that the right way to think about it?\nDavid Barnes: Yeah, there's two ways I think about it, Gal. And where it would be less of a headwind is that a bit of a law of large numbers of 1.3, whatever $1.3 billion of ARR, that'll overcome if they had headwind. And we still have over $400 million on a TTM basis for perpetual software. So there are still available businesses for us to think about, some of which we are actively working on and some of which we're not. And we want to just see how things go and what will make really sense for the business. And so in that sense, you're right, it will be less of a headwind. The other side of it is as we look at other business models, so say, for example, hardware, and they take in the machine control guidance business, where we offer, we call it Trimble platform as a service. So they are cab technology assurance. By buying the machine control technology, we're bundling that with the software, that allows us to connect that physical digital field and the office. And if we're successful in driving that conversion, that may show up is more term type revenue, depends on the accounting works. But it could create some more ratability. And if it does, in that case, that could provide a headwind instead of the tailwind that I just described.\nGal Munda: That's interesting. And just to check, you said, that could happen on the machine control and guidance. Would it be potentially something that you consider in transportation as well? Some of the competitors kind of going down that route, is that something that even an ELD side could work?\nDavid Barnes: Yeah. And we're largely already offering that today, bundling the hardware and the software together and that monthly service. The nature of how some of the accounting works, is it requires you to recognize the hardware revenue upfront, but you may ratably have the cash flow, depending on how the contracts are structured. I'll give you an example on really around our survey business. We've used it with a couple of customers to do a competitive swap on a fleet of equipment, by experimenting with the ratable business model. We've got one of our larger agriculture customers that's doing everything as a service arrangement with us. But those are small pockets and anecdotal examples. But just want to show and demonstrate that we're not just talking about experimenting with all our business models, we're actually doing it.\nGal Munda: Awesome. Thank you so much, and congrats for great results.\nDavid Barnes: Thanks, Gal.\nOperator: And the last question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.\nJason Celino: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Good segue, but to Gal's question on the pace of the transition, or transitions. In software, we've seen a few strategies for incentivizing customers to move to these new pricing offerings. Maybe you could categorize these as a carrot, and not a stick, Rob, maybe could you speak to how you guys are doing there?\nRob Painter: Yeah. Hi, Jason, this is Rob, I'll start. It's more of a carrot than a stick. So, our belief is that we can create more customer goodwill with the approach of the carrot. And so, the carrot that we can offer, I'll use that machine control example. The fundamental value proposition around technology assurance, so staying current on the sensors, staying current actually, on the firmware, that embedded software. You'd be surprised at how many customers can have outdated versions of the firmware. And when we can have a deeper insight to actually into the customer and help and drive customer success, I believe that's giving them a better value proposition and better ROI on their investment. The classic one, as you know, as we move from perpetual to subscription is to move IT operations off center for a customer, and that's providing them a value proposition that I would characterize as a carrot. And then one more I would mention, Jason, is I think a smart -- we think a smart way to do to provide the carrot is to increase the I'll call it increase the value of the offering when you move to the subscription. So in some cases, we're offering both the perpetual and the subscription offering. However, when you buy the subscription offering, you're getting a richer set of functionality and will start to only develop additional functionality in the cloud, because you have to make that break at some point. And we think by providing the better value offering that that is consistent with the carrot approach, as opposed to the stick. Now, that doesn't mean that we'll do both offerings forever. At some point, you do have to wind it down. But, thus far, we've given ample time to our customers to consider their own choices.\nJason Celino: Okay. So, similar question then, for your sales force and your partners, are you running any incentives to influence them to go for the subscription offerings?\nRob Painter: Yeah, follow the money. I mean, it's amazing what you can see if you change our own sales compensation to selling the perpetual versus the subscription, when we make it more attractive to sell the subscription offering the results correlate. No question. And at the dealer partner level, many times we'll use our balance sheet to make them whole at a cash level, because they may be running their businesses more on cash flow. And in that sense, you don't want to provide, at least initially, you don't necessarily want to provide a negative incentive to that. So yeah, you have to connect the go-to-market efforts, absolutely to the product strategy.\nJason Celino: Okay. Great. That's it for me. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Thank you, Jason.\nDavid Barnes: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand it over to Mr. Michael Leyba.\nMichael Leyba: Thank you very much for joining us on the call, everyone. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, a quick reminder that our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you please refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. I'll begin on Page 2, with the key messages we want to convey today. In the first quarter, we exceeded our expectations and delivered record ARR of $1.32 billion, up 9% year-over-year, total revenue growth of 12%, EBITDA of 26%, and trailing 12-month operating cash flow of $745 million. Our results demonstrate the quality of our business model and an improving macro-economic backdrop. They also highlight the strength of our Connect and Scale 2025strategy. On the basis of this competitive strength and the nature of the opportunities we see in the market, we plan to scale up investments in targeted areas of the company. At the same time, we are also raising our guidance for the year. Turning to Page 3, in the market backdrop, the common threat across the industries we serve is delivering products and services that connect the physical and digital worlds. The industries we serve our large, global, underserved and underpenetrated with technology. As our end market digitize, we are able to connect the office and the field with our hardware and our software offerings, in a manner that delivers productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. In buildings and infrastructure, we exceeded expectations in the business, leveraging our strong market position and continuing the conversion of our business models. The segment now stands at approximately 65% software-related revenue. In geospatial, the business experienced the strongest year-over-year growth we have seen, since we created a reporting segment in 2017. Global demand is healthy and the innovation that the team has delivered has strengthened our competitive position. In transportation, we met the P&L expectations we have for the segment in the quarter. Bookings in our mobility business improved to their best level since early 2019. Bookings in our transportation enterprise software business were strong, with subscription bookings more than double the level of our first quarter 2020. We remain confident that we will deliver demonstrable improvement in revenue, margins and ARR trends in the second-half of the year. In resources and utilities, the commodity price backdrop is providing global tailwinds to the business. And we delivered growth well ahead of our expectations. Let's turn next to Page 4, for some proof points on the Trimble operating system, capturing strategy, people and execution. On strategy, we continue to execute on revenue transition opportunities, particularly design and engineering software business announced its shift to subscription that went into effect in March. Different but better, is our tagline, and I think that sums it up well, which is to say, it's more than just change its progress. Our mechanical electrical plumbing business also continued its subscription conversion, and as mentioned, we saw a strong level of recurring bookings in our transportation enterprise business. Finally, I'd like to note that we closed the divestiture of the Manhattan Real Estate Software business early in the second quarter, and we wish the team well in its new home. On people, I'm pleased to report that we ranked number 15 out of 15,000 companies in 2021 Best Global Culture survey. I also want to announce that our CTO, Tom Fansler, retires at the end of the second quarter. Two of our other business leaders, Ron and Patty and Bryn Fosburgh will assume new role starting in the third quarter. Ron will operate as an entrepreneur and residents, driving innovation efforts. And Brent will act as our Interim CTO. I'm pleased to say that we promoted from within for Ron and Brent's current responsibilities for the e-Builder and overall construction businesses, respectively. On execution, we released our sustainability report a few weeks ago. I'm incredibly proud of the work of the team on this important initiative. Our teams also continue to innovate. We launched the civil construction estimating software package, we released a combination of our LOADRITE payload management system with Earthworks Grade Control Platform. We launched a new TSC5 data controller [ph], and we released the new SX12 scanning total station, which is an update to our successful SX10 instrument. The SX12 now supports additional applications in tunneling and underground construction. With respect to increasing investment in the business, we see Connect and Scale as being synonymous with an industry platform strategy. We want to play offense and invest now for the mid- to long-term opportunities that we see in the market. We see a generational opportunity out of a North America infrastructure bill, and a strong commodity price backdrop in the agriculture market. We will invest in product development and go-to-market efforts around infrastructure, and we'll step up investments in our agriculture business, all while continuing to invest in our Trimble cloud platform and our autonomy efforts. A quick update on our plans for an Investor Day, we have concluded that an in-person meeting at our Colorado facility, where much of our leadership team is based, is the best way to facilitate the kind of in-depth interaction that many of you want from an Investor Day. We will hold the meeting in the spring of 2022, by which time the environment for business travel should be greatly improved. We also plan to hold one or two interactive virtual sessions with investors on specific topics of broad interest later this year. In closing, I'm as confident and optimistic about Trimble as ever. We have the right team, pursuing a compelling strategy and attractive markets. It won't be easy, and it won't be linear, but nothing worth achieving is. David, over to you. Hi, Ann. So, I mentioned that Connect and Scale specific strategy is synonymous with the platform strategy and the nucleus, an agriculture market for us is the crop production workflow. So the stepped up investments we're making in agriculture hit areas of that platform that include autonomy, includes our software, includes our correction services, and continuing to build out the networks around that. And then finally, localization efforts, it is the majority of our business these days is outside North America. Thanks, Rob. So, we see it as a generational opportunity. And I'll focus on North America, but highlight that places like the UK are going with construction led recovery. We see markets like Japan promoting digital technologies. Australia has strong infrastructure development as well. In North America, I think about it from the value proposition of what the technology can do. We think about the funding around that. And we mentioned that we would -- with respect to our own funding, we would step up investments in the area, and then we also think about policy. So from a value proposition perspective, with digital technology, we can build greener, we can build more inclusively, and we can build better while doing so cheaper. So it just makes sense to use the technology. What we're hearing from customers and stakeholders in the industry actually is on the policy side as well as a desire to streamline project delivery, by promoting the digital technology. So really streamlining project delivery, really seems to be the core of what the market is talking about. And from a funding perspective, I'll start with government level funding. And, we do anticipate that the final amount will be well-negotiated, and it'll be different than the proposed American jobs plan. Nevertheless, and we need to also reauthorize the surface transportation bill. So the jobs plan, in addition to the reauthorization of the surface transportation bill, we think that will be significant. We think it will be incremental to the current baseline investments in our highways, airports, mass transit, and our ports. Now, we think that won't pass until later in the year. And the benefits of that wouldn't be realized in 2022. So when we think about the investments in our business to get ahead of that, we think both at a product development level, as well as a go-to-market level. So at a product development level, where we're going with the Connect part of Connect and Scale, as integrating the hardware, the software, the physical, the digital, the office, the field, being able to round trip that data to streamline project delivery. So, we'll continue our efforts on that front. And at a go-to-market level, it's putting the resources, increase the level of resources and capabilities in place to actually execute against what we think is attractive and important opportunity. It is changing significantly, I'd say we may not be at the point of calling it significant, it's certainly meaningful amount of change. And I think about it from a few dynamics, I'll address owners, engineers and contractors. At an owner level, think about the Department of Transportation as an owner to talk about a state DoT as an owner. I do think there's increasing awareness of the technology. They're certainly increasing awareness of the concept of the digital twin, and how this can play through the operations and maintenance phase. And if we use the technology during the design, engineering and construction phase, how that can then be leveraged in the operations and maintenance phase. So I think there is increased awareness. We see a few more projects that are promoting the use of technology. Actually, the Federal Highway Administration, they made an announcement recently to recognize as a digitalize belt [ph] is an important technology innovation. So that's helpful to see that coming from that perspective. In the engineering community, certainly, it's in the interest of the engineering community to help fill the delivery of the projects better and faster, and for them to be able to win more of the work. And then at the contractor level, I see that's where we see the most level of proactive use and request for use of technology, because the contractors are the ones who are -- they're really seeing the most tactical benefit of better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener, in their day to day work. So they're winning more work. It's becoming more just the way that construction is done. So very positive on the contractor side. Thanks, Rob. And this is Rob. To add to that, as we exit the year, I think the exit path would... Sure. The short answer, Kristen is yes, that the pipeline is more active at the moment. And, certainly our areas of interest are going to be where we have the most strategic opportunity to grow and to build a platform strategy, whether that's in a construction, agriculture, or in some of our other vertical focused market. So that we feel pretty good about where we are. And as you said, the balance sheet is in a great place to be able to help us facilitate that. This is Rob. There's absolutely an aspect that correlates to the replacement cycle and new products that we have, whether that's on the handheld side with TSC5, or on the GNSS receiver side with our 12I. Those would be replacement examples where we're able to bring in a new instrument or tool, that's able to make the customers more productive. We've got a tighter integration of our software workflows into the hardware. So we've seen customers who are orienting their field survey crews around a Trimble workflow. So it's almost like the tail wagging the dog, where that software is driving the demand for the hardware. There's also examples of our, I'd call them new categories. So take our laser scanner, 3D laser scanner, it's an instrument called the X7. That's a market segment where we didn't historically drive as much business. So that's not a replacement market for us. That's new-new. And then I would say on the go-to-market side, the team's done an excellent job on a global distribution basis of getting our dealers in a better healthier states, and really understanding their own local go-to-market execution. So definitely a mix of both. And really, the team's done great work. Thank you. Sure. So infrastructure and residential backlogs are solid. Healthcare, data centers, logistics centers, utility and fiber optics work, that's all good. And you can look at entities such as ABI and Dodge, and they're up. We look at OEM units, those have been pretty good from both the construction and agriculture side, even mining in places like South Africa and Australia, where we have some exposure of those have been good. So that, call it that general commercial work office buildings, that's low. Education, it's actually much bigger market than one might realize. And so it's still lower, but it's still a large number. And so that's doing okay. Geographically speaking, actually, it's a pretty broad based strength. So, Japan was strong, Australia, strong. North America, strong. Western Europe, and the Nordics are strong. And we see a play through both in software, and I guess we've given you some software answer, but we see it playing through in hardware. So for instance, when residential work picks up, we don't actually have as much exposure in residential on the building software side, but it helps us on the civil side and it helps us on the geospatial business. In civil construction, we see more of the smaller building construction product type equipment. If some of that equipments using technology or concrete screens for foundation work, I mean, geospatial it's survey work. So yeah, that's what's going on. Probably a couple points. Thanks, Rick. Yeah. Hi, Jason, this is Rob, I'll start. It's more of a carrot than a stick. So, our belief is that we can create more customer goodwill with the approach of the carrot. And so, the carrot that we can offer, I'll use that machine control example. The fundamental value proposition around technology assurance, so staying current on the sensors, staying current actually, on the firmware, that embedded software. You'd be surprised at how many customers can have outdated versions of the firmware. And when we can have a deeper insight to actually into the customer and help and drive customer success, I believe that's giving them a better value proposition and better ROI on their investment. The classic one, as you know, as we move from perpetual to subscription is to move IT operations off center for a customer, and that's providing them a value proposition that I would characterize as a carrot. And then one more I would mention, Jason, is I think a smart -- we think a smart way to do to provide the carrot is to increase the I'll call it increase the value of the offering when you move to the subscription. So in some cases, we're offering both the perpetual and the subscription offering. However, when you buy the subscription offering, you're getting a richer set of functionality and will start to only develop additional functionality in the cloud, because you have to make that break at some point. And we think by providing the better value offering that that is consistent with the carrot approach, as opposed to the stick. Now, that doesn't mean that we'll do both offerings forever. At some point, you do have to wind it down. But, thus far, we've given ample time to our customers to consider their own choices. Yeah, follow the money. I mean, it's amazing what you can see if you change our own sales compensation to selling the perpetual versus the subscription, when we make it more attractive to sell the subscription offering the results correlate. No question. And at the dealer partner level, many times we'll use our balance sheet to make them whole at a cash level, because they may be running their businesses more on cash flow. And in that sense, you don't want to provide, at least initially, you don't necessarily want to provide a negative incentive to that. So yeah, you have to connect the go-to-market efforts, absolutely to the product strategy. Thank you, Jason."

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5, with a review of first quarter results. First Quarter revenue was $887 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. Currency translation added 3%, and divestitures subtracted 1%, for a total organic revenue increase of 10%. Gross margin in the first quarter was 58.4%. Margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.1%, up 340 basis points, driven both by higher revenue and strong cost control. Operating income margins expanded 330 basis points to 23.6%. Net income dollars increased by 36%, and earnings per share increased by $0.17 to $0.66 per share. The first quarter cash flow from operations was $228 million, demonstrating the continued strong cash flow generation of our business. Operating cash flow again exceeded net income in the quarter. Free cash flow was $218 million. We paid down $158 million of debt in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio fell to 1.3 times. At the end of the quarter, we had the entire $1.2 5 billion available on our revolving credit facility, and approximately $265 million in cash. With our strong balance sheet, we are well-positioned to continue to invest in our business, both organically and through acquisitions that will accelerate the implementation of our strategy. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our first quarter revenue trends. As mentioned earlier, our ARR was up 9% in the quarter. Our non-recurring revenue streams also grew with hardware growing 17%, and perpetual software growing 11%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth also contributed to perpetual software growth, and some of our hardware offerings are bundled with perpetual software. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 9%. Excluding transportation revenues in North America grew 15%. In Europe, revenues were up 16%, roughly half of our Europe growth was driven by currency, with the balance coming from catch-up on project activities slowed in 2020, fiscal stimulus measures, and recovering demand in many end markets. Asia Pacific had the best performance in the quarter, up 17%, driven by strong growth in Australia and Japan. The rest of world, which includes Brazil and Argentina was up 5% year-over-year, driven principally by strong demand from the agriculture sector. Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Annualized recurring revenue was $1.32 billion in the first quarter, up 9% on a year-over-year basis. Organic ARR growth was approximately 7%. Excluding our transportation segment, Trimble ARR grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter. Net working capital inclusive of deferred revenue was negative this quarter, representing approximately minus 1% of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. Research and Development on a trailing 12-month basis was 15% of revenue. Our deferred revenue grew 12% on a year-over-year basis. And our backlog excluding the impact of the real estate software business divested early in the second quarter was $1.4 billion, up 17% versus prior year. While growing backlog is obviously an indicator of strong momentum in the business. I'll note here that backlog at quarter-end was unusually high, in part because Trimble like so many manufacturers in this recovering economy is experiencing shortages and extended delivery times, for many key components of our hardware products. Our operations team is hard at work to expedite delivery of products, which are in short supply, but we do expect to manage challenges with both cost inflation and extended lead times of select hardware product lines in the quarters to come. Turning now to Slide 8, for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and infrastructure revenue was up 13% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our building and civil construction businesses. Segment margins were up 760 basis points, due to higher margin revenue mix and cost control. Geospatial revenue was up 22% on an organic basis, driven principally by strong performance in our core branded survey equipment business. Margins were up 590 basis points due to strong revenue growth and cost control. Resources and utilities revenue was up 10% on an organic basis. We experienced double digit growth in each of our precision agriculture, positioning services and agriculture software offerings. Margins expanded 190 basis points driven by increased revenue and cost control. Top-line results in transportation were consistent with our expectations. Revenue was down 6% on an organic basis year-on-year, and margins declined 450 basis points. The drivers of revenue and margin decline are broadly consistent with those we have highlighted previously. Revenue and margins were roughly stable sequentially, when compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and leading indicators provide encouraging signs for the recovery ahead. As Rob mentioned, bookings were very strong in both our mobility and enterprise software businesses. Our product performance is improving, and our sales pipeline is stronger than it has been in nearly two years. We remain confident that we are on track to improve performance later this year. Moving to Slide 9, I'll provide an update to our outlook for the year. Given our outperformance in the first quarter, our growing backlog and increasing confidence in our business trends, we are raising our revenue forecast range by $100 million to $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. I'll note here that the biggest risk we have to our revenue outlook for the next couple of quarters is the supply environment for critical hardware components. We expect that revenue growth will be strongest in the second quarter, as we lap the worst period of the COVID lockdowns in 2020, with more moderate growth in the back-half of the year, and especially in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect organic ARR growth in the high single digits with improving trends as the year progresses. From a profitability perspective, we continue to expect that EBITDA margins will come in between the levels of 2019 and 2020. Margins for the balance of 2021, and especially in the second-half of the year, are likely to come down from the levels we achieved in the first quarter for a number of reasons. First, we expect some operating expense acceleration as the year progresses and the environment for business travel opens up. Second, we are accelerating investments that Rob mentioned earlier. These investments include spending on our digital transformation and cloud infrastructure, and higher R&D on our autonomy projects, and our agricultural product offerings. And third, we are seeing growing cost pressure in our hardware costs of goods, across a broad range of commodities. We are adapting our pricing and discounting strategies to reflect these cost pressures, but still anticipate some adverse impact on our gross margins. We continue to expect that software business model transitions from perpetual to recurring will impact revenue growth and operating margins by approximately 150 basis points. Our earnings per share outlook is raised to $2.30 to $2.50. This reflects the revenue and operating margin trends, I mentioned earlier, and a modestly higher tax rate outlook than we had anticipated a quarter ago. From a cash flow perspective, we spent cash flow from operations of approximately 1.1 times net income, with free cash flow exceeding net income. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Hi, Ann, this is David. I'll take the first part of your question on gross margins. I'll say the environment for product cost has changed a lot, just in the last month or two. And it's a fluid situation, so it's hard to make specific predictions. I will say that the product inflation that we're facing really only began toward the end of Q1. So the results that we just reported don't reflect the full impact we anticipate later this year. And you saw our gross margins declined year-on-year about 70 basis points, and probably just under half of that can be accounted counted for in product cost increases. But we're seeing increases across the board. Obviously, we're all reading about semiconductor tight supply and cost increases, but we're really seeing it across a whole broad range of commodities, in transportation, particularly air transportation that we use to get our products where we need them to go. So, without getting too specific, I'll say that we do expect underlying cost of goods inflation for the balance of the year to be noticeably higher than it was in Q1. Now, I'll comment that we're adapting, as I mentioned in the script, our discounting strategy and our top-line prices, and we hope to accommodate a meaningful portion of the impact of the costs increases, but nonetheless, we expect gross margins will come down for that reason, in the remaining three quarters of the year. And then, I'll turn over to Rob for your questions about operating expense and the investments we're making. Our technology is on over 150 million acres of farm today, that's primarily the hardware, the guidance systems. We have about 20% of that same acreage covered with our software. So, it's not -- this isn't new, let's say it's been in motion for a long time. I see the delta of the 80% is a potentially addressable market, obviously, we won't serve 100% of that. The other way to look at it, Ann, that's a software hardware connection. The other way to look at it as from a correction services perspective. So we have well over 100,000 users of our correction services today. And the connected farm that is an aspect. So when the scale part of Connect and Scale is about making ourselves easier to do business with, and bringing that software, the hardware and the services together at the point of sale. So, we think there is a demand for a market. Ashok, it's David. We have a meaningful hardware business in buildings and infrastructure, so that will be impacted by the hardware dynamics, I discussed previously. And I also mentioned that overall for the company, we expect to see some operating expense pickup. I'll call some of it natural, because with COVID we had almost no business travel, we had lower incentive compensation. So that will normalize. And then the investments that we're making will be seen in the segments broadly. So those dynamics are going to put pressure on margins in all the segments, including buildings and infrastructure. I'll say one thing, as I mentioned in my remarks, we sell a meaningful amount of perpetual software bundled with the hardware. So, when hardware grows like it did in the first quarter perpetual software grows. We are in the process of transitioning from perpetual to subscription, Rob mentioned in one of our design software offerings, and that sort of tends to precipitate perpetual software growth. So that was a piece of it. But, overall, let's remember we're comparing with the first quarter of last year when we saw particularly toward the end of the quarter, a lot of hesitancy and great uncertainty. So customers were starting to be reluctant to buy. And I think all those factors contributed to perpetual software growth. Yeah. Hey, Chad, this is David. I'll say first of all, that comparing quarter-to-quarter last year is a tough drill, because last year was so strange. And particularly as we recall Q2, we saw a rapid contraction in demand, and many of that are end markets, and then a lot of catch-up and pick up later in the year. So that's going to factor in. As far as the end markets that are driving the results, we mentioned in transportation, we ended about where we thought we would P&L wise, but bookings were up, and obviously the transportation market has picked up in terms of the macros with asset utilization and pricing and the financial solidity of our transportation customers is better. So, that's more of a tailwind for future quarters than this one. But, look beyond that, in the other three segments, we exceeded our expectations. So that's why the outlook came up in part, because Q1 was above where we thought it would be. And we think some of those trends will continue. And the caution I'll provide is that hardware still a meaningful part of our business. And for all the reasons I mentioned, with the supply chain challenges, that's creating the greatest level of uncertainty. So I don't know if that answers your questions about seasonality. We do think seasonality will be different in 2021 from 2020, for a number of reasons. And you're probably better off comparing with 2019 for a normalized year. Yeah, I'll say it's a very complicated formula. We have contractual arrangements with our customers and dealers that don't facilitate an immediate increase in price in some cases. So that's a factor. With some protection of supply chain side too, but those don't necessarily match up. So, I think for Trimble and every company producing hardware, this is a rapidly moving situation. Our intention, obviously, we will remain competitive. Our intention is to recoup a meaningful portion of the increase in product costs. And I'll say, we can't have a specific estimate with high confidence in that cost. But we believe we'll get a meaningful chunk, but not all of it. And that's why we expect to see some gross margin declines, or continuing decline for the remainder of the year. That's right. I think if you look at what's happening in the world, the semiconductor side of things is going to take probably three or four, maybe five quarters to recover. Some of the other input costs are likely to abate sooner than that. For instance, air freight will get more reasonable once trans-oceanic aircraft recovers. So there are a lot of moving pieces. I don't think this is a long-term change in the trajectory of our gross margins. But, it will be with us for a few quarters. Kristen, I'll just point out the obvious that some of the factors that have been driving our trends are somewhat unique to Trimble, in terms of the issues we had, post the ELD mandate coming into effect. And we did have some product performance issues. And so, the pullback in ARR was a consequence of that. There's no doubt that the macros in the transportation business are dramatically better than they were three to four quarters ago, and that's helpful. Our business trends won't change linearly and right away with the changes in the macro environment, with the customers that we serve experience. So it's not at all surprising to any of us that we have some lag. But, I'll say there are a number of factors that give us confidence that we're on the road back to better trends and transportation, just to highlight a few. Our churn is trending down on a secular basis, there are bumps quarter-to-quarter as individual customers implement decisions they made some time ago. But, the data truly points to a better trend there. Rob mentioned the bookings, even beyond the bookings, our sales pipeline is looking up versus where it was a quarter or two ago. The performance of our products is improving. So our teams have done a great job of resolving the product issues. And I think we're seeing broader customer receptivity through the strategy of the integrated supply chain. So we have a lot of work to do in transportation, Kristen, so we're not changing the outlook, that things will get better immediately. But, we do look to see improve trends toward the back-half of the year, and especially the fourth quarter. Hey, Eric. I'll say it's a little hard to quantify when orders come through exactly whether they're for current demand or they're seeing the supply chain tighten up. I think it's a mixture of both. Our backlog, I mentioned is now up to $1.4 billion, a meaningful increase year-on-year. I'd say the increase year-on-year for the hardware piece is a mix of healthy demand and end markets, and some customers ordering before they otherwise would have. But I'll say inventory at our dealers is really low. And I think most of what you're seeing is the fact that the end markets are really healthy. And projects are picking up and customers need the product. Hey, Richard its David. First thing I'll say is that in terms of what I'll call costs generated by COVID, we didn't have much. The impact of COVID on our costs was really negative. We had some costs in our cleaning our facilities and that kind of thing, but it was relatively de minimis. So we had sort of artificially low costs in a number of areas. With the revenue coming down, our incentive comp naturally reduced. We stopped traveling canceled events. And we really cut back on a lot of discretionary spending, that wasn't core to the strategy. So that's coming back. And as you look at the operating expense growth going forward, I'll put it in a handful of buckets. First of all, some of our OpEx is overseas and the U.S. dollar is weakened. So just the FX impact sort of takes up our accounts for about 20% of our OpEx increase that we expect for the balance of the year. But 60% of the increase is what I'll call go back to normal, as travel comes back, as incentive comp comes back, as we start hiring. We didn't even have our salary increase last year. So that's the normal part of things. And then about 20%, the remaining 20% of the year-on-year OpEx increase will be accounted for in higher spending in the investment areas that Rob mentioned. There a couple other things that are puts in takes, you've got some other headcount, ads and divestitures. But, hopefully that gives you a broad bucketing. And we do think year-on-year OpEx, which was about flat in Q1, it won't be flat in the remaining quarters. Good chunk. Yeah. It will definitely, I think, be a constraint. And as you think about the $100 million dollar range between the bottom and the top end of the revenue guidance, the uncertainties around hardware supply account for majority of that. So, I think the scenario in which we're at the lower end of the guidance range is characterized by increasing tightness in markets for key components. And the higher end is one in which, we're able to work through the constraints. So it is a hard one to call. It's somewhat unprecedented, talking to my colleagues who've been doing this work for decades, and none of them have seen anything just like it. So we have a very adept operations team. It's one of the strengths of Trimble of being flexible and figuring out how to handle bumps in the road, like we have now. So, we're looking at this component by component and product by product, and I'll concede that there's meaningful uncertainty, and that's what's driving the range in our guidance. Yeah, there's two ways I think about it, Gal. And where it would be less of a headwind is that a bit of a law of large numbers of 1.3, whatever $1.3 billion of ARR, that'll overcome if they had headwind. And we still have over $400 million on a TTM basis for perpetual software. So there are still available businesses for us to think about, some of which we are actively working on and some of which we're not. And we want to just see how things go and what will make really sense for the business. And so in that sense, you're right, it will be less of a headwind. The other side of it is as we look at other business models, so say, for example, hardware, and they take in the machine control guidance business, where we offer, we call it Trimble platform as a service. So they are cab technology assurance. By buying the machine control technology, we're bundling that with the software, that allows us to connect that physical digital field and the office. And if we're successful in driving that conversion, that may show up is more term type revenue, depends on the accounting works. But it could create some more ratability. And if it does, in that case, that could provide a headwind instead of the tailwind that I just described. Yeah. And we're largely already offering that today, bundling the hardware and the software together and that monthly service. The nature of how some of the accounting works, is it requires you to recognize the hardware revenue upfront, but you may ratably have the cash flow, depending on how the contracts are structured. I'll give you an example on really around our survey business. We've used it with a couple of customers to do a competitive swap on a fleet of equipment, by experimenting with the ratable business model. We've got one of our larger agriculture customers that's doing everything as a service arrangement with us. But those are small pockets and anecdotal examples. But just want to show and demonstrate that we're not just talking about experimenting with all our business models, we're actually doing it. Thanks, Gal. Thanks, Jason."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Fourth Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nRob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website; and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. The Trimble 3-4-3 operating model simultaneously balances a view on looking forward 3 months, 4 quarters and 3 years. As I think about framing today\u2019s commentary on 2022, I think there is a parallel to look back 3 months at our fourth quarter, 4 quarters to look back at the year 2022, and 3 years back to 2020 when we began our Connect and Scale journey. COVID, supply chain disruptions and net divestitures over these last 3 years has created a dynamic that makes it challenging to discern the signal from the noise in any given quarter, especially when looking at the year-over-year trends; whereas the long baseline reveals the definitive patterns of progression. As I reflect on the fourth quarter of 2022, let\u2019s begin on Slide 2 with our key messages, which are consistent with the commentary from the prior quarter. Our key growth metric is annualized recurring revenue, which met our expectations and grew 16% to a record level of $1.60 billion. Congratulations to the team for delivering this record performance, which compares to $1.19 billion of ARR at the end of 2019. Total revenue for the year was a record $3.68 billion, up 7% over 2021, and up 6% compounded since 2019, growing through COVID and business model transitions. Total revenue in the quarter was $857 million, flat with last year, and towards the lower end of our guidance range. The delta between the ARR and total revenue performance reflects a slowdown in hardware sales through our dealer partners, as dealers continued to sell-through their inventory while processing mixed macroeconomic sentiment. For perspective, over the last 3 years, the sum of our civil, agriculture and survey hardware and related software has grown at a 12% compound annual growth rate, with agriculture growing above and survey growing below this baseline. Gross margin finished at a record level of 61.8%, exceeding our expectations, reflecting software mix, the cumulative impact of model conversions and abating supply chain disruptions. For the year, we achieved a 60% gross margin, a record annual level, up 170 basis points year-over-year, which compares to 57.7% gross margin in 2019. EBITDA margin of 24.3% met our expectations in the quarter and ended at 25% for the year, up 210 basis points as compared to 22.9% in 2019. Finally, earnings per share of $0.60 was exactly at the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. Moving to Slide 3, let\u2019s look at the progression of our Connect and Scale strategy through the lens of our reporting segments, beginning with Buildings and Infrastructure. The big event for the team was our Trimble Dimensions user conference in November, where we had over 5,700 attendees from the global engineering and construction industry, which provided a great forum to reconnect with our customers and partners. We launched many new innovations, including the Trimble Construction Cloud, powered by Microsoft Azure, which is an industry cloud built to streamline construction projects by connecting users, data and workflow. We also announced extensions of our machine control technology platform to new OEMs and new machine types, further expanding our reach to connect the physical and digital worlds. The highlight financial achievement in the quarter was delivering over 20% organic growth in ARR, in addition to record levels of ACV software bookings and record levels of cross-sell bookings. We also had a strong start for our newly acquired Bid2Win business, where we\u2019ve had some early cross-sell wins. As we have previously discussed, we continue to allocate incremental capital towards our own digital transformation, as well as our go-to-market efforts, which are generating strong interest from our customers and partners and demonstrating encouraging signs of internal productivity and efficiency. The work we are doing in this business will be highly leveraged across the entirety of the company. In Geospatial, revenue was down further than expected, as dealers moderated their inventory levels in the face of softening demand and macro uncertainty. Looking at the indicators, we see softness in residential, and while a portion of the expansion of infrastructure is getting consumed by inflation, underlying optimism remains in the market. For perspective, I look at the 3-year CAGR that I talked about on Slide 2 in order to calibrate the long baseline performance. Strategically speaking, in 2022, we continued to launch new innovations in GNSS, 3D laser scanning and handheld data collectors, and we achieved a double-digit increase in ARR as our business model strategy takes hold. In Transportation, we delivered revenue and ARR growth in line with expectations, in addition to delivering the fourth quarter in a row of operating margin expansion. Connect and Scale progression also came in the form of continued development of connected workflows, such as Connected Maintenance, Connected Locations and Engage Lane. The big story, of course, in the fourth quarter was the announcement of the Transporeon acquisition. To refresh memories, Transporeon operates a leading cloud-based transportation management platform, powering a global network of 145,000 carriers and 1,400 shippers. The platform integrates with more than 3,000 systems and powered more than 25 million transactions in 2022. For me, this is the very definition of a Connect and Scale business. I had a chance to spend a few days in Europe with Stephan Sieber and the Transporeon team in January, and my level of conviction of strategic and cultural fit has only increased. We are still working through regulatory approvals and we expect to close the deal in the first half of this year. We are excited to get to work together. In Resources and Utilities, revenue and ARR growth were led by our positioning services, utilities and forestry businesses. Our definition of utilities covers our work with electrical and water utilities, but our positioning services business can also be thought of as a utility, in this case, precision GPS as a utility. In October, we announced that we crossed a hurdle of 34 million hands-free miles driven with General Motors and their Super Cruise program. Our precise GPS technology enables a vehicle to maintain its lane position in various environments, and we are working on several other Tier 1 and OEM program opportunities. Moving to agriculture, revenue was flat year-over-year, and up when excluding Russia and Ukraine. The 3-year, double-digit CAGR growth on Slide 2 is instructive for calibrating the long baseline growth of the agriculture business. With a product lens on Connect and Scale, we are now bundling our guidance hardware, software and our positioning services, providing both easier access to the technology and a better value proposition for our customers. With a go-to-market lens on Connect and Scale, users and customers are at the center of our strategy. In pursuit of this strategy, we announced this week that we are taking a different approach to our go-to-market relationship with CNH Industrial. Moving forward, our distribution to aftermarket customers, after a 12-month transition period, will be done entirely through independent dealer partners, with the product bearing the Trimble brand. Less than 20% of our revenue in the Resources and Utilities segment goes through CNH to their dealer network today. We expect to maintain this revenue and address aftermarket demand and the needs of farmers through our direct relationships with our independent dealer network. This evolved approach to distribution will also enhance our ability to offer OEM brand agnostic solutions to customers to help them orchestrate their field operations with mixed fleets of equipment. Our new approach to aftermarket distribution will improve our ability to sell our full range of technology solutions to aftermarket customers, including guidance, selective spraying, variable rate application, water management and our Connected Farm works center software solution. Our evolving strategy will also enhance our ability to cooperate with OEMs across the industry for their needs for factory-fit equipment. Let me now turn the call over to David to take us through the numbers.\nDavid Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Starting on Slide 4, I'd like to begin my financial commentary this quarter by discussing organic growth trends across the components of our business. As Rob mentioned earlier, our recurring revenue businesses grew strongly year-on-year in the fourth quarter, with ARR up 16%. The strength of our recurring revenue offerings in a weakening and uncertain macroeconomic environment validates our focus on the continued evolution of our business model. While our recurring revenue streams were strong in the fourth quarter, revenues of hardware and related software were down. Organic hardware revenue was down 13% versus prior year and came in below our expectations. The factors driving the slowdown in our hardware business in the fourth quarter were consistent with what we described in our third quarter call. During the fourth quarter, our dealers continued to reduce their inventory levels, reflecting both our improving supply chain execution and uncertainty in the future economic outlook. The drop in demand was most pronounced in our Geospatial segment, as our surveying end customers ordered less than they did earlier in 2022. Hardware backlog reduced sequentially during the quarter as expected. From a geographic perspective, revenues were up modestly on an organic basis in both North America and the Rest of World, with strong trends in Latin America, but were down in Europe and in Asia Pacific. Year-on-year, Europe trends were meaningfully impacted by the loss of business in Russia and Ukraine and were up 1% organically excluding that impact. With that as a backdrop, I\u2019d like to turn now to our total financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Starting on Slide 5, fourth quarter revenues of $857 million were flat on an organic basis, and down 8% when including the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions and divestitures. Gross margin was up 400 basis points, reflecting both the accelerating mix shift toward software and the positive net impact of our price increases and moderating cost inflation. EBITDA margin was up 20 basis points and operating margin was down 20 basis points, as increases in our gross margin largely offset higher spending against our Connect and Scale strategy, especially our digital transformation and higher spending on travel and trade shows. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60. Looking at cash flow, both cash flow from operations and free cash flow were, as expected, down year-on-year, with the single biggest factor being the amortization of R&D for tax purposes. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter, and do not plan to restart our repurchases until we are well on the way to de-levering following the issuance of debt to fund the Transporeon acquisition. Turning to Slide 6 and results for the full year 2022, we achieved success across a number of critical dimensions. Organic revenue grew by 7%. Gross margin improved by 170 basis points, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing mix shift. EBITDA margin was 25%, even as we restored spending across a number of areas that had been constrained during the COVID pandemic and as we accelerated investments against our strategy. Cash flow was down year-on-year principally as a result of an increase in our inventories and a change in U.S tax legislation, both of which we expect to normalize over time. As we move to complete the Transporeon acquisition, we take this on with a strong balance sheet. Working capital remains negative. Our year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at 1.4x and the ratings agencies maintained our bond ratings and stable outlooks following the announcement of the transaction. Turning now to our quarterly and annual results by segment on Page 7. Speaking to the fourth quarter, Buildings and Infrastructure achieved organic ARR growth of over 20% and recurring bookings growth in the high teens. Sales of civil construction hardware were down year-on-year by just over 10%, leading to organic revenue growth for the segment of 2%. Dealers continued to reduce their inventory levels, and end market demand moderated. Segment margins at 25% were down year-on-year, impacted by lower civil construction revenue, our Dimensions user conference, subscription transition and Connect and Scale investments. Revenues in the hardware centric Geospatial segment were down 12% year-on-year on an organic basis, driven principally by declining dealer inventory levels and softer end market demand across the surveying sector. Segment revenues were also pressured by lower shipments to U.S Federal customers, which vary meaningfully from quarter-to-quarter and can be difficult to predict. Segment margins remained over 25% despite these headwinds. Revenues in our Resources and Utilities segment were up 6% organically driven by growth from Cityworks and positioning services sold to agriculture customers. Our agriculture revenue was impacted by the loss of business in Russia and Ukraine, with an estimated year-on-year impact of minus 5% to the segment in the fourth quarter. Segment margins improved in the quarter sequentially and versus prior year, coming in just under 36%. Our fourth quarter results in the Transportation segment reflect improvement across a number of dimensions. Organic revenue grew 5%, driven by higher year-on-year sales of Enterprise and Maps software solutions. ARR for the segment grew at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter. Revenue trends in our mobility offerings improved sequentially from prior quarters, driven in part by higher sales to our largest OEM customer. Operating margins of 14.5% were the highest since 2019, and reflect strong performance by our team in managing costs. Let\u2019s turn next to our guidance for 2023 on Slide 8. The projections I will share with you today exclude the impact of our pending acquisition of Transporeon. Starting with ARR, we expect organic ARR growth at a mid-teens level in 2023. Our strong outlook for ARR growth is grounded in the solid bookings momentum we achieved in 2022, the potential for accelerated cross-sell as our digital transformation rolls out to a growing portion of our business, and the essential role that our software plays in our customers\u2019 operations. Our outlook for revenue, excluding future acquisitions and divestitures, is $3.7 million to $3.8 billion, reflecting an expectation of organic growth in the range of 2% to 5%. As a reminder, divestitures of businesses in 2022 will impact total reported revenue growth trends, with the biggest impact in the first half of the year. Our cautious outlook for 2023 organic revenue growth is rooted in an expectation of continued dealer inventory reductions over the next several quarters, and softer end market demand in an environment of limited GDP growth. We expect revenue from hardware and related software will be down in the low single digits organically for the year, offset by strong recurring revenue growth. From a margin perspective, we expect that gross margins will improve by over 200 basis points as our business mix continues to shift in the direction of higher margin software. We expect a modest increase in operating margins, as we invest against our strategy in an environment where organic revenue growth is harder to come by. I'll note here that our leadership teams have been working hard over the last several months to adapt our spending plans to the current economic climate. Allocating capital against our strategic priorities is always a major focus for us, and the need for sharp focus is never higher than in a time of weak economic growth. We are confident that we can continue to progress our strategy within the constraints of our operating plan. Income from equity investments is expected to be relatively flat with 2022, and net interest expense is forecast at approximately $70 million. Netting this out, we project to achieve earnings per share in the range of $2.66 to $2.86. We expect that cash flow will grow significantly in 2023 driven in part by reductions in inventory levels. We expect free cash flow for the year of approximately 1x non-GAAP net income. Our cash flow forecast for this year now assumes that amortization of R&D costs under Section 174 of the U.S tax code will not be repealed within a time frame that will allow us to recover the accelerated tax payments that we made in 2022. While we believe that there is bipartisan support for this change, we are less confident than we were a quarter ago that this legislation will pass soon enough to help us this year. By way of reminder, this issue impacts the timing of tax payments and has an immaterial impact on our tax rate. If Section 174 is repealed within the next several months, our free cash flow would benefit by approximately $150M. Note that our cash flow guidance excludes the impact of transactional costs related to the pending Transporeon acquisition. While we are not offering quarterly guidance, a few factors are likely to impact the sequential evolution of our financial results as the year progresses. We expect organic revenue to be down in the first quarter and flat in the first half of the year, reflecting the strong growth in hardware and related offerings that we saw in the first half of 2022. We expect organic revenue to be up in the mid- to high-single digits in the second half of the year. Influenced by these revenue growth patterns, we expect operating and EBITDA margins to be relatively flat in the first half of the year, and up in the second half. While we expect mid-teens organic ARR growth for the year, growth in the first half is likely to be slightly lower driven by planned churn from a small number of customers. We expect ARR growth to improve sequentially through the year. From a segment perspective, we expect organic revenue growth for the year in the Building and Infrastructure, Resources and Utilities, and Transportation segments, with the strongest growth in Buildings and Infrastructure. Revenues in the Geospatial segment are expected to decline for the year, with the highest levels of organic decline in the first quarter as we lap strong numbers from the first quarter of 2022. Geospatial trends through 2023 will continue to be impacted by reductions in dealer inventory levels and ongoing softness in demand in a number of the segment\u2019s end markets. We expect margins to be stable in Buildings and Infrastructure and Resources and Utilities. We project growth in Transportation margins, while Geospatial margins will be down modestly for the year. Back to you Rob.\nRob Painter: Let me thank our colleagues, customers and partners for their support and their work in our strategic and financial progression. I\u2019m proud to say that we continue to win culture and innovation awards, and proud to announce that we received approval of our emissions reduction targets by the Science Based Targets Initiative. Our objective is a 50% reduction in scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2030. In addition, we released our first task force on climate related financial disclosures report. In 2022, our highlight financial metrics were ARR growth and gross margin expansion. Our 2022 ACV bookings give us confidence that we can continue to grow ARR at a double-digit rate in 2023. Hardware demand remains the hardest revenue stream to predict. While the signals are mixed, and even a bit confusing in the short-term, the long-term secular attractiveness remains. Our ability to uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds provides a guiding light for our business and remains the foundation of our right to win in our served markets. We have surgically reduced our expense structure and moderated spending across the Company to ensure discipline and focus in an uncertain environment. What remains certain is our conviction to grow our business by focusing on our customers and continuing to execute our Connect and Scale strategy. Operator, let\u2019s now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Jonathan Ho at William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to maybe start out with the CNH aftermarket deal. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on why it makes sense to do this now and what this could potentially do for the resources and utility segment, particularly as you engage more with the independent dealers?\nRob Painter: Hey, good morning, Jonathan. It's Rob. So let me give you -- break it down in three respects, context, strategy and next steps. For context, let's talk about Connect and Scale, and our strategy means to connect users data and workflow and the users are at the center of our universe. And in that we believe we need to be closer to the customers that user, that farmer. So when we talk to the customers, and we work with, by the way over 100 OEMs today, and obviously, the farmers themselves, what they're asking us to do is to help them manage a mixed fleet. And I personally visited farmers in the last 6 months in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Japan, Australia, Germany, and here in the U.S. So the strategy is we -- go-to-market strategy is we sell-through multiple avenues today to reach our customers we sell. We have a direct sales, particularly the enterprise farms, we sell-through OEMs, we work with over 100 OEMs and then we sell-through a channel, and the channel breaks down into a Trimble channel that we already have today to reach the aftermarket as well as selling through CNH dealers in the aftermarket. So what we're moving from is where we sell to CNH today, so call it CNH --from Trimble to CNH corporate to reach the CNH dealer. That's the from the to -- the to be state we'll be going from Trimble straight to independent dealers. And those independent dealers will be capable of selling the full line of Trimble CAT, which is more than guidance, because we also do variable rate, we do selective spraying, we do water management, and we do software. So as we look forward to this, as we work through the transition, we need to sign up the dealers to be independent dealers directly with Trimble. And we think it can expand the available set of products and capabilities they have to take to market, we think that will help us be incrementally closer to the end users of the technology and in a context of customer success, which is part of our strategy. And we think we can help customers and those users become more successful with the technology because when we're out there in the field, talking to them, they are asking for help to integrate and manage a mixed fleet of technology as well as mixed fleet of equipment.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I think you've also referenced some additional investments that you'd like to make for that Connect and Scale in the 2023 timeframe. Can you help us understand where those investments are going to go? And again, maybe why that makes sense to make those investments now, given the macro environment? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Sure. So we've been investing in this strategy incrementally, really for the last couple of years. And demonstrable evidence of where we see the attractiveness of it and I'd say momentum for it is in the growth of the ARR. So the work we're doing up front really is touching more of our software businesses first, and particularly the recurring revenue businesses that we have. So a post of 16% organic growth on ARR, the 1.6 billion. This is supporting growth, continued growth and as and I think from a shareholder value perspective, this would be the most valuable revenue stream that we have at the company. The investments, they pick up systems, they pick up people, they pick up process, so from a systems perspective and customer facing, I think internal facing from a connect -- The scale part of Connect and Scale, enabling us to efficiently and effectively grow. Look at people and the work that we're doing, we look at customer success. Customer Success is about net retention. That's the metric you look at for customer success. And the economics of net retention are very, very powerful. So I'm of a mind, we're of a mind that we continue down this path. And if anything, we continue down this path with more, more conviction. And behind all of this there's a strong balance sheet 24.3% EBITDA in the quarter. So we believe this is emphatically the right thing to do at this moment.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Jonathan.\nOperator: We'll go next to Rob Wertheimer at Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: Hey, good morning, everybody. It seems like there's a lot of structural progress next quarter on margins on ARR, which is, I guess, continuing and the surprise, I guess, for us was just a bigger destock in the hardware than we would have thought. And so, I had a couple of questions around that. One is, were you able to see those elevated levels of inventory, previously dealers and for the normal after what you look in your outlook, or are they low? I mean, there's any characterization that I guess there's been a debate in construction in North America anyway, as to whether large projects will fill in, smaller projects go away. And that seems to be the case. But maybe your mix of your customers is more fragmented than the big ones. I'm just trying to look for context around why that decline happened and is continuing and how big it is.\nDavid Barnes: Yes, hey, Rob. Its David Barnes. First point I'll make is that the supply chain, the constraints, and then the removed constraints has really moved trends around in our shipments, in our dealer inventory, that were hard to predict and in some cases, challenging to understand. So just by way of reminder, we had unsustainably and undesirably high hardware backlog early in 2022. Our supply chain even today isn't fully freed up, but to the extent that it freed up it happened very dramatically at the end of second quarter. So we shipped a lot of product, you'll recall that the hardware revenue was way up at that timeframe. So dealer inventories did grow. And I'll say it took us a while to figure out how quickly the dealers were able to find customers for and deploy that inventory. And that happened exactly while some of the end markets that our dealers serve slow, particularly in the geospatial side. There's probably the highest within Trimble level of exposure direct and indirect, to residential home construction, which slowed. There's some anxiety about the general economic outlook. So these two things happened all together, freeing up our supply chains, very big backlog, lots of shipments and I created the destocking that we talked about a quarter ago, and it has picked up. We're not through it yet. We think we have a pretty good sense of where our dealers want to be and where they will be over the sustained period of time. It's my guess that we'll have two more quarters, Q1 and Q2 of meaningful inventory reductions in our dealers and anything after that will be smaller. But the guidance we've given reflects that expectation.\nRob Wertheimer: And any guess on if those two quarters happen, or would dealers be lower than normal at that point, and they maybe don't have perfect visibility into the channel, I understand.\nDavid Barnes: Yes, well, what I'll say is that we still do have isolated cases of supply challenges in our Ag, one of them. But I think at that point, they'll be -- so that there may be some reasons For dealers to have a little more inventory than they would have had pre-COVID, not much though. Supply is really good. Hey, Rob, the thing I remind you on as we look at this noise of one quarter to another, big increases in the first half of '22. And the decline, we just reported, Rob had a good chart in his presentation of the multiyear trend. We're still way above where we were. So we do think that a lot of this is the noise of the resetting of the supply chain. That's the bigger factor really than any fundamental change in demand.\nRob Wertheimer: That's perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chad Dillard at Bernstein.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good morning, guys.\nRob Painter: Hey. Hi Chad. So I just want to go back to the CNH agreement. I just think in better understand the medium-term organic growth potential and maybe you can talk about what needs to be done to set up the independent channel. And when you expect that to be in place, and just how much of your product portfolio, you'll be able to sell within that channel versus how much you're able to sell with CNH.\nRob Painter: Hey, Chad, so this is Rob. I'll start with the quantitative framework. We had a chart on the second slide that showed over the last 3 years. The CAGR of the hardware businesses has been 12%. Those three businesses are surveys, civil construction, And Ag. Ag has been above that 12%. growth over the last 3 years. And Ag grew this year. And it grew even more if you exclude Russia and Ukraine, which was we were selling quite a bit of kit and to Russia. And so we'll start to lap that later this year, mid this year. So to call that context, in terms of the growth that we've had. And I'll give you some more context when we look at -- we look at units, we look at pricing, we look at share of wallet, we look at market share, and we think we're holding our own on a global basis and probably growing, growing in, Europe holding around and North America growing in Brazil. So we now turn to the to the CNH part of your question. For this only for that we're talking about the aftermarket business that we have with CNH. As we -- and that business that we sell-through CNH into the aftermarket today is primarily guidance. So an opportunity we have as we move to independent dealers. And remember we have independent dealers today, they're Trimble, four line Trimble dealers today in agriculture. As we move the business that goes through CNH, that gives us an opportunity to expand the product portfolio to a set of independent dealers. Those independent dealers could very well be dealers we already work with today, that just will happen in a direct route with a direct relationship with us at Trimble or it may be a fully New Dealer, we have a 12-month transition with CNH on this part of the arrangement. And it's a very positive conversation. I want to say that we've been having with the CNH with the CNH team. So optimistic here, it's the right thing to do with what our customers are asking for. And it's time to get to work to set it up. That's helpful. And then just my second question. So can you give an update on the digital transformation? What percentage are you done -- [indiscernible] '23. Can you talk about some of the focus areas for this coming year, and if you can quantify just like the incremental cost to execute expecting for '23.\nDavid Barnes: So from -- I'll start with the second part, the incremental cost is about 100 bps to the bottom line consistent with what we've we had this year as well. So that's the cost side of the equation. On the focus side of the equation, the digital transformation, there's a meta theme, its more than a system transformation for us. So, I think about people, I think about process and think about systems and the systems themselves. And then we think about the go-to-market specs of the digital transformation. And it's primarily focused right now on supporting our software businesses, particularly software businesses within buildings, and infrastructure. And that connects with the Trimble construction one dialogue that we've had with you and others. And so, first point of reference I look at is continuing to grow the ACB bookings, which is the leading indicator for the growth of the ARR. When we look at net retention as a key metric as well with inside that go-to-market. We look at the organization of the sales team itself and the go-to-market. So in France, Benelux, we've put the construction sales team together, software team as 1 organization. We've mostly done that in North America as well. And so it's getting the sales team aligned to sell consolidated offering of Trimble Construction One. And then with Trimble Construction One, it started out as a general -- targeted to general contractors and then we will be releasing more persona-based bundles. Remember, we sell to owners in the public sector. We sell to architects and engineers. So we have targeted portfolios to sell to those personas with the go-to-market team, a sales team that comes more and more together, as 1 organization to be enabled and equipped to sell everything that we do. On the system side, in the second quarter, we'll have the next, I'll say, big release of the systems. Those systems are meant to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our own sellers. And it moves closer and closer to having commerce capabilities -- e-commerce capabilities from an external -- with an external lens. On the people side, we continue to invest in customer success. And on the process side, we continue to invest in developing the playbooks for how we go-to-market starting with that software business, but then the next wave after that goes into software and other parts of Trimble and then into the hardware that we sell-through our dealer channels. And I was asked -- we got asked a question earlier in the call about visibility into dealers and their inventory. This is another reason that we think that the systems investments are a good thing for us to get increased levels of precision on that visibility. Hope that helps, Chad.\nChad Dillard: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Kristen Owen at Oppenheimer.\nKristen Owen: Great. Thank you for the question. So I wanted to ask about the e-Builder, Viewpoint SketchUp contingency. This business is obviously doing quite well and a pretty stark contrast to some of the more conservative macro views that you've expressed. And even just on an ARR growth basis, really strong compared to some of the peers in the software space. We've talked about the macro, but I'm just wondering from a portfolio basis, if you can speak to the playbook with these businesses what's working in this environment? And just how do you intend to port those lessons learned over once the Transporeon acquisition closes?\nRob Painter: Sure. Good morning, Kristen. This is Rob. I will answer the question. So you're correct, that contingent of businesses is doing very well and it's even more than e-Builder, Viewpoint, SketchUp, it's from a Tekla Structures offering our mechanical electrical plumbing software as well or project management software, really the whole contingent is performing. I'll say 1 thing that is nice on the software side and the recurring revenue is certainly get a higher degree of predictability. There is not a wholesale in between the retail and so you get a clear demand -- a clear view of the demand, which is why, by the way, on the hardware side, we're looking back at the 3-year trend on the CAGR so that we can see the signal through the noise. In terms of what's working with it, I would say it's the value proposition meets the digitization of the market. So call it the secular aspect of digitization, had a chance to meet with a number of construction companies during my travels over the last month was with one of the largest European contractors in the world yesterday here in Colorado. And digitization and data and sustainability are at the top -- very top of the agenda of those customers, and they know they need to adopt technology in order to further their strategies. Most of these -- many -- most of these companies have solid backlog and they need technology to help them get the work done. From a value proposition perspective, we are hearing strong resonance with the -- I'd say both the integrated and connected offerings and Trimble Construction One certainly seems to have resonance with the customers that we're talking to, even in its early form that it is. We see that and as evidence of that, we had a record level of cross-sell ACV bookings and building infrastructure in the fourth quarter. So that tells me that there's -- it's not just marketing resonance. It actually has resonance in terms of turning into business. So the value proposition it's around a connected offering. So customers increasingly are looking to move from optimizing tasks to optimizing the system. And to do that, they need to have more connected data and more connected workflows. We are hearing customers say they -- this is -- because this is where they want to go, they want to buy it from one company as opposed to having to stitch together multiple, let's say, multiple vendors on their own. They like the ease of the dealing with the one company or even the one overall account representative. So there's an aspect of ease to doing business with us, meets a level of connectivity which is ultimately they\u2019re trying to get to do their work better, faster, safer, cheaper [indiscernible], and it is resonating.\nKristen Owen: Thanks for that, Rob. And [indiscernible] some of those lessons with Transporeon, how you see maybe some of that value proposition or combining the offerings, how you see that bleeding into the transportation business once that acquisition has closed.\nRob Painter: Yes. Sorry, I forgot about that -- great to. Thanks for the question. So on Transporeon, I'd say the great news of Transporeon is they already have that through the 140,000 carriers. About 1,400 shippers in the network. 3,000 integrations of PRP and [indiscernible] management systems and already last year had $25 million --transactions run through the system. It is definitively a platform company really and in the mode of connect and scale. So they have a set of connected capabilities. They're selling it through a dedicated sales force. There's a land-and-expand play within that. There's strong net retention. There's strong growth retention in the business. So actually, I see as much that we can take from Transporeon to Trimble as much as we -- I think that we could take aspects of Trimble into the Transporeon business, I would like to say, it's 1 of the many reasons I'm excited by that because I think it will be DNA additive to us as where -- and I know this, as we're e-Builder and Viewpoint acquisitions were additive to us at Trimble to take the best of and take it to other model transitions that we've done. And I see the same thing in store with Transporeon.\nKristen Owen: That\u2019s super helpful. I will leave it there. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will move to our next question from Tami Zakaria at JPMorgan.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. Hope everyone is doing well. So my first question is the gross margin grade expansion 200 to 250 basis points, how much of that is price cost tailwind? And how much of that is software versus hardware mix change? And are there any other factors driving this leverage this year?\nDavid Barnes: Tami, it's David. The way to think about that is essentially all of the gross margin improvement is the evolving mix of our business. We are continuing to take price mostly in hardware, but at a lower rate so that's not real the margin driver. What's driving our margins up is we're becoming more and more of a software business and those have higher gross margins.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. So if prices keep coming down, input prices, could that be a source of up site to your gross margin rate?\nRob Painter: It's -- there's a number of puts and takes in our hardware gross margin. We've already seen a benefit. So in the third and fourth quarter of '22, we got to the point where for our hardware businesses, our price realization more than offset our cost improvements. So that's sort of baked into the run rate now. We are continuing to take pricing at a moderate level in our hardware businesses. So that ought to help our margins just a little bit on the hardware side, but by far bigger story is the mix shift.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. So one quick one. One is to back to the destocking comment. Can you talk about what sales to end users look like in the fourth quarter against the dealer destocking is to date sales to end users overall moderate, and fourth quarter versus the third quarter?\nRob Painter: Yes. So let me frame it up this way. If we look at our dealer destocking, I would say it had a negative approximately 400 basis point impact on our organic revenue trends. So we reported flat. We would have been roughly up 4% without the dealer destocking. So if you look specifically at hardware, our hardware revenues organically were down 13. So I think you can infer, Tami, that there was some market softness, particularly in Geospatial surveying market in Q4, which partly we think is temporal. We had a lot of new products last year and as in many businesses, when you have new products, you get a spike in orders, and we had a clean supply chain to deliver those through. So we've got a bit of a pullback for that reason. Fundamentally, I would say the secular end market sales to retail trends feel up -- maybe not up as much as they were earlier in 2022, but the general direction is up. There's some soft areas, including anything tied directly to residential construction that is clearly contracted. But on the balance with what's happening in infrastructure, we think the secular direction of demand is up. But with the dealer destocking and the customer ordering patterns earlier in '22, we're seeing a pullback for those reasons.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Jason Celino at KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJason Celino: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. So I think you mentioned churn in the first half impacting the ARR growth, what type of customers or what segment are you seeing these come from?\nDavid Barnes: Yes, hey Jason, its David Jason, it's David. We do expect churn from a handful of customers, principally in our Transportation segment. These are customers that made a decision to come off our platforms many quarters ago, and they're just now implementing them. So I see that as noise, not signal our customer satisfaction and retention in transportation is on a secular positive trend. We just expect to see a number of these probably in the first quarter pull off. So that will reduce our ARR growth rate a little bit lower in Q1 from what we expect to see for the full year.\nJason Celino: Okay. And then maybe if I were to simplify it, your construction software portfolio seems to be executing quite well. But it's -- completely different drivers than the hardware destocking element. So are you seeing any macro impact on this construction software portfolio? Thanks.\nRob Painter: The short answer is no, not seeing an impact on the software  Portfolio.\nDavid Barnes: Excellent. Thanks.\nDavid Barnes: Welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich at Goldman Sachs. \nJerry Revich: Yes, good morning, everyone. Rob, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the progress on Trimble construction. One, what proportion of new orders does it account for now? And when we last caught up, you were seeing tripled-AASP versus base orders before. I'm wondering if that trend has continued?\nRob Painter: Hey, Jerry, good morning. It was so, on TC1, the Trimble Construction One, the best evidence I can give you on the progress is that comes in the form of the record level of cross-sell and upsell that we had in the quarter on from an ACV bookings perspective. And the reality is not all of that is the Trimble Construction One branded portfolio. So there are some aspects where we can just sell across the portfolio, which I'd say, a subset really of TC1. That cross-sell is a percent of the total ACV bookings and Buildings & Infrastructure software was nearly 30%. So for us, that's a record dollars, record percentage level. And when we go through the business reviews, we look at almost every account to look at what they're buying and why they're buying it and looking at the competitive win ratios. What we're seeing is when we're selling the bundled offerings, whether it's less than the full TC1 offering or it's TC1 as we're seeing the sales cycles reduce. We're seeing the size of the bookings go up. We're seeing the win ratios go up as well. And so in aggregate, it looks to be a winning formula. And I would add to that, Jerry, that it's still relatively early in the game for us. And so with the sales kickoff meetings that we've been having in the last weeks, it is really a big emphasis to the team. So to get the offering out to the general contractors and then the next person is after that in architecture engineering owners and public sector and then geographically rolling that out as well and aligning the sales team behind that and then actually doing the sales enablement work underneath the covers, which is critical to help the sellers with their effectiveness. So I'd say, Jerry, lots in aggregate or in some, I think lots of good things happening on this front, and we'll keep updating you here every quarter.\nOperator: We will go next to Rob Mason at Baird.\nRob Mason: Yes, good morning. First question, I just wanted to clarify a comment from earlier. I think around the cost for Connect and Scale, there was a mention of 100 basis points. Is that -- what is built into the '23 guidance? Or was that the cost for '22? And then maybe just as an extension to that question, just talk about the -- where you've settled now on the -- maybe the model that you're planning to implement on the hardware-software bundles that are transitioning those conversions. I think there were several options presented at the Investor Day. I'm just curious, can you speak to the -- maybe what year 1, year 2 economics will look like on those.\nDavid Barnes: Yes. Hey, Rob. It's David Barnes. I'll try both. On the Connect and Scale discrete investments spending on that '22versus '21 was about 100 basis points around $40 million. Embedded in our guidance for 2023 is a deceleration in the rate of growth. So we'll spend somewhere in the order of another $20 million or a little more than that, $1million incremental, $23 million above $22 million. We still have more to do and we are -- we believe this is a high priority investment. With regard to the model options, I would say the menu that we presented at the Investor Day is still out there. This topic is tied with digital transformation, our ability to sell hardware and software bundles together in recurring basis is heavily dependent on the rollout of our digital transformation. We're doing it in a somewhat [indiscernible] way now, but the bulk of that opportunity is ahead of us and all the options that we showed at the investors still options we're considering.\nRob Painter: And Rob, I want to add just a bit of context too, on top of the Connect and Scale investments because it's a capital allocation call. And so we've taken down spend in other parts of the company, in part to help fund what we're doing here. So we've thought a lot about the cost management aspect of our model. If we look over the last 3 years, organically, ARR has grown double-digit over 12%. Total revenue has grown 6%. The gross margin dollars have grown faster than that, as the mix shifts more software-centric. And our total headcount organically has grown2% over that time frame. So a third of total revenue growth, [indiscernible] of the ARR growth. And so it's very much in context of how we're thinking about allocating capital at Trimble and where we're putting it to work.\nRob Mason: Well, maybe as a follow-on to that, Rob. Transporeon following that completion of that, you will be in somewhat of a deleverage mode, but how much flexibility are you giving yourself or to be able to do a transaction like, I guess, a rivet or something along those lines, I guess, on the capital allocation side to supplement Connect and Scale?\nRob Painter: Let's say, from a flexibility -- if we're talking acquisition and deployment of the balance sheet, I would say here in the next 12 to 18 months, not a lot of flexibility because our primary commitment is to deleverage. So certainly, anything at scale, I would say we've limited some flexibility of the balance sheet. Now if it's not at scale, and so if it's -- whether it's a rivet size acquisition or it's Trimble Ventures, where we put single-digit millions to work. In that aspect, I would say we do retain some flexibility with caution to stay close to making sure we understand our model and that we're taking a relatively conservative view of the balance sheet. Now to the P&L, let's not forget that in 2022, 38% of our total revenue now recurring. $1.6 billion that's grown, we believe will grow double-digit again in next year. So our P&L has more visibility than it's ever had and therefore the business model has got more resilience. And so -- and we maintain the investment grade. So I look at those factors altogether, and I'd say there's [indiscernible] flexibility on a smaller size of capital deployment, not a lot of flexibility on transformative sized deals for the next couple of years.\nRob Mason: Sure. Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: We'll go next to [indiscernible] at Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for Gal. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow-up on a prior question regarding digital transformation. How is the progress for revenue being transacted through the connected digital platform tracking versus your expectations? And where did that shake out as a portion of revenue for FY '22. At the Investor Day, I believe 2% of revenue had or had been expected to be the target as communicated so as that met or exceeded and do the projections show that your investor base still stands for the portion of revenues expected to transact through the digital platform in the future? And then just 1 brief follow-up. Thanks.\nRob Painter: The short answer is yes. Yes, with the 2% our business in Europe, and that's live and working, and we're just about to roll out the next phased to North American principally to our North American software businesses and with further rollouts from there. But we're moving forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just one follow-up. Has anything changed from the time Transporeon was announced that would maybe alter the expectations for revenue and EBITDA initially communicated at the announcement of the acquisition or everything all good there so.\nDavid Barnes: Yes. Look, we've communicated the financial parameters there. We still don't own the business. Obviously, we're talking to them, but we have no update to our outlook, and we'll update that outlook once the transaction closes at some point in the first half of this year.\nRob Painter: Thank you guys.\nDavid Barnes: Sure. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Michael Leyba for closing remarks.\nMichael Leyba: Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website; and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. The Trimble 3-4-3 operating model simultaneously balances a view on looking forward 3 months, 4 quarters and 3 years. As I think about framing today's commentary on 2022, I think there is a parallel to look back 3 months at our fourth quarter, 4 quarters to look back at the year 2022, and 3 years back to 2020 when we began our Connect and Scale journey. COVID, supply chain disruptions and net divestitures over these last 3 years has created a dynamic that makes it challenging to discern the signal from the noise in any given quarter, especially when looking at the year-over-year trends; whereas the long baseline reveals the definitive patterns of progression. As I reflect on the fourth quarter of 2022, let's begin on Slide 2 with our key messages, which are consistent with the commentary from the prior quarter. Our key growth metric is annualized recurring revenue, which met our expectations and grew 16% to a record level of $1.60 billion. Congratulations to the team for delivering this record performance, which compares to $1.19 billion of ARR at the end of 2019. Total revenue for the year was a record $3.68 billion, up 7% over 2021, and up 6% compounded since 2019, growing through COVID and business model transitions. Total revenue in the quarter was $857 million, flat with last year, and towards the lower end of our guidance range. The delta between the ARR and total revenue performance reflects a slowdown in hardware sales through our dealer partners, as dealers continued to sell-through their inventory while processing mixed macroeconomic sentiment. For perspective, over the last 3 years, the sum of our civil, agriculture and survey hardware and related software has grown at a 12% compound annual growth rate, with agriculture growing above and survey growing below this baseline. Gross margin finished at a record level of 61.8%, exceeding our expectations, reflecting software mix, the cumulative impact of model conversions and abating supply chain disruptions. For the year, we achieved a 60% gross margin, a record annual level, up 170 basis points year-over-year, which compares to 57.7% gross margin in 2019. EBITDA margin of 24.3% met our expectations in the quarter and ended at 25% for the year, up 210 basis points as compared to 22.9% in 2019. Finally, earnings per share of $0.60 was exactly at the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter. Moving to Slide 3, let's look at the progression of our Connect and Scale strategy through the lens of our reporting segments, beginning with Buildings and Infrastructure. The big event for the team was our Trimble Dimensions user conference in November, where we had over 5,700 attendees from the global engineering and construction industry, which provided a great forum to reconnect with our customers and partners. We launched many new innovations, including the Trimble Construction Cloud, powered by Microsoft Azure, which is an industry cloud built to streamline construction projects by connecting users, data and workflow. We also announced extensions of our machine control technology platform to new OEMs and new machine types, further expanding our reach to connect the physical and digital worlds. The highlight financial achievement in the quarter was delivering over 20% organic growth in ARR, in addition to record levels of ACV software bookings and record levels of cross-sell bookings. We also had a strong start for our newly acquired Bid2Win business, where we've had some early cross-sell wins. As we have previously discussed, we continue to allocate incremental capital towards our own digital transformation, as well as our go-to-market efforts, which are generating strong interest from our customers and partners and demonstrating encouraging signs of internal productivity and efficiency. The work we are doing in this business will be highly leveraged across the entirety of the company. In Geospatial, revenue was down further than expected, as dealers moderated their inventory levels in the face of softening demand and macro uncertainty. Looking at the indicators, we see softness in residential, and while a portion of the expansion of infrastructure is getting consumed by inflation, underlying optimism remains in the market. For perspective, I look at the 3-year CAGR that I talked about on Slide 2 in order to calibrate the long baseline performance. Strategically speaking, in 2022, we continued to launch new innovations in GNSS, 3D laser scanning and handheld data collectors, and we achieved a double-digit increase in ARR as our business model strategy takes hold. In Transportation, we delivered revenue and ARR growth in line with expectations, in addition to delivering the fourth quarter in a row of operating margin expansion. Connect and Scale progression also came in the form of continued development of connected workflows, such as Connected Maintenance, Connected Locations and Engage Lane. The big story, of course, in the fourth quarter was the announcement of the Transporeon acquisition. To refresh memories, Transporeon operates a leading cloud-based transportation management platform, powering a global network of 145,000 carriers and 1,400 shippers. The platform integrates with more than 3,000 systems and powered more than 25 million transactions in 2022. For me, this is the very definition of a Connect and Scale business. I had a chance to spend a few days in Europe with Stephan Sieber and the Transporeon team in January, and my level of conviction of strategic and cultural fit has only increased. We are still working through regulatory approvals and we expect to close the deal in the first half of this year. We are excited to get to work together. In Resources and Utilities, revenue and ARR growth were led by our positioning services, utilities and forestry businesses. Our definition of utilities covers our work with electrical and water utilities, but our positioning services business can also be thought of as a utility, in this case, precision GPS as a utility. In October, we announced that we crossed a hurdle of 34 million hands-free miles driven with General Motors and their Super Cruise program. Our precise GPS technology enables a vehicle to maintain its lane position in various environments, and we are working on several other Tier 1 and OEM program opportunities. Moving to agriculture, revenue was flat year-over-year, and up when excluding Russia and Ukraine. The 3-year, double-digit CAGR growth on Slide 2 is instructive for calibrating the long baseline growth of the agriculture business. With a product lens on Connect and Scale, we are now bundling our guidance hardware, software and our positioning services, providing both easier access to the technology and a better value proposition for our customers. With a go-to-market lens on Connect and Scale, users and customers are at the center of our strategy. In pursuit of this strategy, we announced this week that we are taking a different approach to our go-to-market relationship with CNH Industrial. Moving forward, our distribution to aftermarket customers, after a 12-month transition period, will be done entirely through independent dealer partners, with the product bearing the Trimble brand. Less than 20% of our revenue in the Resources and Utilities segment goes through CNH to their dealer network today. We expect to maintain this revenue and address aftermarket demand and the needs of farmers through our direct relationships with our independent dealer network. This evolved approach to distribution will also enhance our ability to offer OEM brand agnostic solutions to customers to help them orchestrate their field operations with mixed fleets of equipment. Our new approach to aftermarket distribution will improve our ability to sell our full range of technology solutions to aftermarket customers, including guidance, selective spraying, variable rate application, water management and our Connected Farm works center software solution. Our evolving strategy will also enhance our ability to cooperate with OEMs across the industry for their needs for factory-fit equipment. Let me now turn the call over to David to take us through the numbers. Let me thank our colleagues, customers and partners for their support and their work in our strategic and financial progression. I'm proud to say that we continue to win culture and innovation awards, and proud to announce that we received approval of our emissions reduction targets by the Science Based Targets Initiative. Our objective is a 50% reduction in scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2030. In addition, we released our first task force on climate related financial disclosures report. In 2022, our highlight financial metrics were ARR growth and gross margin expansion. Our 2022 ACV bookings give us confidence that we can continue to grow ARR at a double-digit rate in 2023. Hardware demand remains the hardest revenue stream to predict. While the signals are mixed, and even a bit confusing in the short-term, the long-term secular attractiveness remains. Our ability to uniquely connect the physical and digital worlds provides a guiding light for our business and remains the foundation of our right to win in our served markets. We have surgically reduced our expense structure and moderated spending across the Company to ensure discipline and focus in an uncertain environment. What remains certain is our conviction to grow our business by focusing on our customers and continuing to execute our Connect and Scale strategy. Operator, let's now open the line for questions. Hey, good morning, Jonathan. It's Rob. So let me give you -- break it down in three respects, context, strategy and next steps. For context, let's talk about Connect and Scale, and our strategy means to connect users data and workflow and the users are at the center of our universe. And in that we believe we need to be closer to the customers that user, that farmer. So when we talk to the customers, and we work with, by the way over 100 OEMs today, and obviously, the farmers themselves, what they're asking us to do is to help them manage a mixed fleet. And I personally visited farmers in the last 6 months in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Japan, Australia, Germany, and here in the U.S. So the strategy is we -- go-to-market strategy is we sell-through multiple avenues today to reach our customers we sell. We have a direct sales, particularly the enterprise farms, we sell-through OEMs, we work with over 100 OEMs and then we sell-through a channel, and the channel breaks down into a Trimble channel that we already have today to reach the aftermarket as well as selling through CNH dealers in the aftermarket. So what we're moving from is where we sell to CNH today, so call it CNH --from Trimble to CNH corporate to reach the CNH dealer. That's the from the to -- the to be state we'll be going from Trimble straight to independent dealers. And those independent dealers will be capable of selling the full line of Trimble CAT, which is more than guidance, because we also do variable rate, we do selective spraying, we do water management, and we do software. So as we look forward to this, as we work through the transition, we need to sign up the dealers to be independent dealers directly with Trimble. And we think it can expand the available set of products and capabilities they have to take to market, we think that will help us be incrementally closer to the end users of the technology and in a context of customer success, which is part of our strategy. And we think we can help customers and those users become more successful with the technology because when we're out there in the field, talking to them, they are asking for help to integrate and manage a mixed fleet of technology as well as mixed fleet of equipment. Sure. So we've been investing in this strategy incrementally, really for the last couple of years. And demonstrable evidence of where we see the attractiveness of it and I'd say momentum for it is in the growth of the ARR. So the work we're doing up front really is touching more of our software businesses first, and particularly the recurring revenue businesses that we have. So a post of 16% organic growth on ARR, the 1.6 billion. This is supporting growth, continued growth and as and I think from a shareholder value perspective, this would be the most valuable revenue stream that we have at the company. The investments, they pick up systems, they pick up people, they pick up process, so from a systems perspective and customer facing, I think internal facing from a connect -- The scale part of Connect and Scale, enabling us to efficiently and effectively grow. Look at people and the work that we're doing, we look at customer success. Customer Success is about net retention. That's the metric you look at for customer success. And the economics of net retention are very, very powerful. So I'm of a mind, we're of a mind that we continue down this path. And if anything, we continue down this path with more, more conviction. And behind all of this there's a strong balance sheet 24.3% EBITDA in the quarter. So we believe this is emphatically the right thing to do at this moment. Thanks, Jonathan. Hey. Hi Chad. So I just want to go back to the CNH agreement. I just think in better understand the medium-term organic growth potential and maybe you can talk about what needs to be done to set up the independent channel. And when you expect that to be in place, and just how much of your product portfolio, you'll be able to sell within that channel versus how much you're able to sell with CNH. Hey, Chad, so this is Rob. I'll start with the quantitative framework. We had a chart on the second slide that showed over the last 3 years. The CAGR of the hardware businesses has been 12%. Those three businesses are surveys, civil construction, And Ag. Ag has been above that 12%. growth over the last 3 years. And Ag grew this year. And it grew even more if you exclude Russia and Ukraine, which was we were selling quite a bit of kit and to Russia. And so we'll start to lap that later this year, mid this year. So to call that context, in terms of the growth that we've had. And I'll give you some more context when we look at -- we look at units, we look at pricing, we look at share of wallet, we look at market share, and we think we're holding our own on a global basis and probably growing, growing in, Europe holding around and North America growing in Brazil. So we now turn to the to the CNH part of your question. For this only for that we're talking about the aftermarket business that we have with CNH. As we -- and that business that we sell-through CNH into the aftermarket today is primarily guidance. So an opportunity we have as we move to independent dealers. And remember we have independent dealers today, they're Trimble, four line Trimble dealers today in agriculture. As we move the business that goes through CNH, that gives us an opportunity to expand the product portfolio to a set of independent dealers. Those independent dealers could very well be dealers we already work with today, that just will happen in a direct route with a direct relationship with us at Trimble or it may be a fully New Dealer, we have a 12-month transition with CNH on this part of the arrangement. And it's a very positive conversation. I want to say that we've been having with the CNH with the CNH team. So optimistic here, it's the right thing to do with what our customers are asking for. And it's time to get to work to set it up. That's helpful. And then just my second question. So can you give an update on the digital transformation? What percentage are you done -- [indiscernible] '23. Can you talk about some of the focus areas for this coming year, and if you can quantify just like the incremental cost to execute expecting for '23. Sure. Good morning, Kristen. This is Rob. I will answer the question. So you're correct, that contingent of businesses is doing very well and it's even more than e-Builder, Viewpoint, SketchUp, it's from a Tekla Structures offering our mechanical electrical plumbing software as well or project management software, really the whole contingent is performing. I'll say 1 thing that is nice on the software side and the recurring revenue is certainly get a higher degree of predictability. There is not a wholesale in between the retail and so you get a clear demand -- a clear view of the demand, which is why, by the way, on the hardware side, we're looking back at the 3-year trend on the CAGR so that we can see the signal through the noise. In terms of what's working with it, I would say it's the value proposition meets the digitization of the market. So call it the secular aspect of digitization, had a chance to meet with a number of construction companies during my travels over the last month was with one of the largest European contractors in the world yesterday here in Colorado. And digitization and data and sustainability are at the top -- very top of the agenda of those customers, and they know they need to adopt technology in order to further their strategies. Most of these -- many -- most of these companies have solid backlog and they need technology to help them get the work done. From a value proposition perspective, we are hearing strong resonance with the -- I'd say both the integrated and connected offerings and Trimble Construction One certainly seems to have resonance with the customers that we're talking to, even in its early form that it is. We see that and as evidence of that, we had a record level of cross-sell ACV bookings and building infrastructure in the fourth quarter. So that tells me that there's -- it's not just marketing resonance. It actually has resonance in terms of turning into business. So the value proposition it's around a connected offering. So customers increasingly are looking to move from optimizing tasks to optimizing the system. And to do that, they need to have more connected data and more connected workflows. We are hearing customers say they -- this is -- because this is where they want to go, they want to buy it from one company as opposed to having to stitch together multiple, let's say, multiple vendors on their own. They like the ease of the dealing with the one company or even the one overall account representative. So there's an aspect of ease to doing business with us, meets a level of connectivity which is ultimately they're trying to get to do their work better, faster, safer, cheaper [indiscernible], and it is resonating. Yes. Sorry, I forgot about that -- great to. Thanks for the question. So on Transporeon, I'd say the great news of Transporeon is they already have that through the 140,000 carriers. About 1,400 shippers in the network. 3,000 integrations of PRP and [indiscernible] management systems and already last year had $25 million --transactions run through the system. It is definitively a platform company really and in the mode of connect and scale. So they have a set of connected capabilities. They're selling it through a dedicated sales force. There's a land-and-expand play within that. There's strong net retention. There's strong growth retention in the business. So actually, I see as much that we can take from Transporeon to Trimble as much as we -- I think that we could take aspects of Trimble into the Transporeon business, I would like to say, it's 1 of the many reasons I'm excited by that because I think it will be DNA additive to us as where -- and I know this, as we're e-Builder and Viewpoint acquisitions were additive to us at Trimble to take the best of and take it to other model transitions that we've done. And I see the same thing in store with Transporeon. Thank you. It's -- there's a number of puts and takes in our hardware gross margin. We've already seen a benefit. So in the third and fourth quarter of '22, we got to the point where for our hardware businesses, our price realization more than offset our cost improvements. So that's sort of baked into the run rate now. We are continuing to take pricing at a moderate level in our hardware businesses. So that ought to help our margins just a little bit on the hardware side, but by far bigger story is the mix shift. Yes. So let me frame it up this way. If we look at our dealer destocking, I would say it had a negative approximately 400 basis point impact on our organic revenue trends. So we reported flat. We would have been roughly up 4% without the dealer destocking. So if you look specifically at hardware, our hardware revenues organically were down 13. So I think you can infer, Tami, that there was some market softness, particularly in Geospatial surveying market in Q4, which partly we think is temporal. We had a lot of new products last year and as in many businesses, when you have new products, you get a spike in orders, and we had a clean supply chain to deliver those through. So we've got a bit of a pullback for that reason. Fundamentally, I would say the secular end market sales to retail trends feel up -- maybe not up as much as they were earlier in 2022, but the general direction is up. There's some soft areas, including anything tied directly to residential construction that is clearly contracted. But on the balance with what's happening in infrastructure, we think the secular direction of demand is up. But with the dealer destocking and the customer ordering patterns earlier in '22, we're seeing a pullback for those reasons. The short answer is no, not seeing an impact on the software  Portfolio. Hey, Jerry, good morning. It was so, on TC1, the Trimble Construction One, the best evidence I can give you on the progress is that comes in the form of the record level of cross-sell and upsell that we had in the quarter on from an ACV bookings perspective. And the reality is not all of that is the Trimble Construction One branded portfolio. So there are some aspects where we can just sell across the portfolio, which I'd say, a subset really of TC1. That cross-sell is a percent of the total ACV bookings and Buildings & Infrastructure software was nearly 30%. So for us, that's a record dollars, record percentage level. And when we go through the business reviews, we look at almost every account to look at what they're buying and why they're buying it and looking at the competitive win ratios. What we're seeing is when we're selling the bundled offerings, whether it's less than the full TC1 offering or it's TC1 as we're seeing the sales cycles reduce. We're seeing the size of the bookings go up. We're seeing the win ratios go up as well. And so in aggregate, it looks to be a winning formula. And I would add to that, Jerry, that it's still relatively early in the game for us. And so with the sales kickoff meetings that we've been having in the last weeks, it is really a big emphasis to the team. So to get the offering out to the general contractors and then the next person is after that in architecture engineering owners and public sector and then geographically rolling that out as well and aligning the sales team behind that and then actually doing the sales enablement work underneath the covers, which is critical to help the sellers with their effectiveness. So I'd say, Jerry, lots in aggregate or in some, I think lots of good things happening on this front, and we'll keep updating you here every quarter. And Rob, I want to add just a bit of context too, on top of the Connect and Scale investments because it's a capital allocation call. And so we've taken down spend in other parts of the company, in part to help fund what we're doing here. So we've thought a lot about the cost management aspect of our model. If we look over the last 3 years, organically, ARR has grown double-digit over 12%. Total revenue has grown 6%. The gross margin dollars have grown faster than that, as the mix shifts more software-centric. And our total headcount organically has grown2% over that time frame. So a third of total revenue growth, [indiscernible] of the ARR growth. And so it's very much in context of how we're thinking about allocating capital at Trimble and where we're putting it to work. Let's say, from a flexibility -- if we're talking acquisition and deployment of the balance sheet, I would say here in the next 12 to 18 months, not a lot of flexibility because our primary commitment is to deleverage. So certainly, anything at scale, I would say we've limited some flexibility of the balance sheet. Now if it's not at scale, and so if it's -- whether it's a rivet size acquisition or it's Trimble Ventures, where we put single-digit millions to work. In that aspect, I would say we do retain some flexibility with caution to stay close to making sure we understand our model and that we're taking a relatively conservative view of the balance sheet. Now to the P&L, let's not forget that in 2022, 38% of our total revenue now recurring. $1.6 billion that's grown, we believe will grow double-digit again in next year. So our P&L has more visibility than it's ever had and therefore the business model has got more resilience. And so -- and we maintain the investment grade. So I look at those factors altogether, and I'd say there's [indiscernible] flexibility on a smaller size of capital deployment, not a lot of flexibility on transformative sized deals for the next couple of years. The short answer is yes. Yes, with the 2% our business in Europe, and that's live and working, and we're just about to roll out the next phased to North American principally to our North American software businesses and with further rollouts from there. But we're moving forward. Thank you guys."

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Starting on Slide 4, I'd like to begin my financial commentary this quarter by discussing organic growth trends across the components of our business. As Rob mentioned earlier, our recurring revenue businesses grew strongly year-on-year in the fourth quarter, with ARR up 16%. The strength of our recurring revenue offerings in a weakening and uncertain macroeconomic environment validates our focus on the continued evolution of our business model. While our recurring revenue streams were strong in the fourth quarter, revenues of hardware and related software were down. Organic hardware revenue was down 13% versus prior year and came in below our expectations. The factors driving the slowdown in our hardware business in the fourth quarter were consistent with what we described in our third quarter call. During the fourth quarter, our dealers continued to reduce their inventory levels, reflecting both our improving supply chain execution and uncertainty in the future economic outlook. The drop in demand was most pronounced in our Geospatial segment, as our surveying end customers ordered less than they did earlier in 2022. Hardware backlog reduced sequentially during the quarter as expected. From a geographic perspective, revenues were up modestly on an organic basis in both North America and the Rest of World, with strong trends in Latin America, but were down in Europe and in Asia Pacific. Year-on-year, Europe trends were meaningfully impacted by the loss of business in Russia and Ukraine and were up 1% organically excluding that impact. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to turn now to our total financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Starting on Slide 5, fourth quarter revenues of $857 million were flat on an organic basis, and down 8% when including the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions and divestitures. Gross margin was up 400 basis points, reflecting both the accelerating mix shift toward software and the positive net impact of our price increases and moderating cost inflation. EBITDA margin was up 20 basis points and operating margin was down 20 basis points, as increases in our gross margin largely offset higher spending against our Connect and Scale strategy, especially our digital transformation and higher spending on travel and trade shows. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60. Looking at cash flow, both cash flow from operations and free cash flow were, as expected, down year-on-year, with the single biggest factor being the amortization of R&D for tax purposes. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter, and do not plan to restart our repurchases until we are well on the way to de-levering following the issuance of debt to fund the Transporeon acquisition. Turning to Slide 6 and results for the full year 2022, we achieved success across a number of critical dimensions. Organic revenue grew by 7%. Gross margin improved by 170 basis points, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing mix shift. EBITDA margin was 25%, even as we restored spending across a number of areas that had been constrained during the COVID pandemic and as we accelerated investments against our strategy. Cash flow was down year-on-year principally as a result of an increase in our inventories and a change in U.S tax legislation, both of which we expect to normalize over time. As we move to complete the Transporeon acquisition, we take this on with a strong balance sheet. Working capital remains negative. Our year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio stood at 1.4x and the ratings agencies maintained our bond ratings and stable outlooks following the announcement of the transaction. Turning now to our quarterly and annual results by segment on Page 7. Speaking to the fourth quarter, Buildings and Infrastructure achieved organic ARR growth of over 20% and recurring bookings growth in the high teens. Sales of civil construction hardware were down year-on-year by just over 10%, leading to organic revenue growth for the segment of 2%. Dealers continued to reduce their inventory levels, and end market demand moderated. Segment margins at 25% were down year-on-year, impacted by lower civil construction revenue, our Dimensions user conference, subscription transition and Connect and Scale investments. Revenues in the hardware centric Geospatial segment were down 12% year-on-year on an organic basis, driven principally by declining dealer inventory levels and softer end market demand across the surveying sector. Segment revenues were also pressured by lower shipments to U.S Federal customers, which vary meaningfully from quarter-to-quarter and can be difficult to predict. Segment margins remained over 25% despite these headwinds. Revenues in our Resources and Utilities segment were up 6% organically driven by growth from Cityworks and positioning services sold to agriculture customers. Our agriculture revenue was impacted by the loss of business in Russia and Ukraine, with an estimated year-on-year impact of minus 5% to the segment in the fourth quarter. Segment margins improved in the quarter sequentially and versus prior year, coming in just under 36%. Our fourth quarter results in the Transportation segment reflect improvement across a number of dimensions. Organic revenue grew 5%, driven by higher year-on-year sales of Enterprise and Maps software solutions. ARR for the segment grew at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter. Revenue trends in our mobility offerings improved sequentially from prior quarters, driven in part by higher sales to our largest OEM customer. Operating margins of 14.5% were the highest since 2019, and reflect strong performance by our team in managing costs. Let's turn next to our guidance for 2023 on Slide 8. The projections I will share with you today exclude the impact of our pending acquisition of Transporeon. Starting with ARR, we expect organic ARR growth at a mid-teens level in 2023. Our strong outlook for ARR growth is grounded in the solid bookings momentum we achieved in 2022, the potential for accelerated cross-sell as our digital transformation rolls out to a growing portion of our business, and the essential role that our software plays in our customers' operations. Our outlook for revenue, excluding future acquisitions and divestitures, is $3.7 million to $3.8 billion, reflecting an expectation of organic growth in the range of 2% to 5%. As a reminder, divestitures of businesses in 2022 will impact total reported revenue growth trends, with the biggest impact in the first half of the year. Our cautious outlook for 2023 organic revenue growth is rooted in an expectation of continued dealer inventory reductions over the next several quarters, and softer end market demand in an environment of limited GDP growth. We expect revenue from hardware and related software will be down in the low single digits organically for the year, offset by strong recurring revenue growth. From a margin perspective, we expect that gross margins will improve by over 200 basis points as our business mix continues to shift in the direction of higher margin software. We expect a modest increase in operating margins, as we invest against our strategy in an environment where organic revenue growth is harder to come by. I'll note here that our leadership teams have been working hard over the last several months to adapt our spending plans to the current economic climate. Allocating capital against our strategic priorities is always a major focus for us, and the need for sharp focus is never higher than in a time of weak economic growth. We are confident that we can continue to progress our strategy within the constraints of our operating plan. Income from equity investments is expected to be relatively flat with 2022, and net interest expense is forecast at approximately $70 million. Netting this out, we project to achieve earnings per share in the range of $2.66 to $2.86. We expect that cash flow will grow significantly in 2023 driven in part by reductions in inventory levels. We expect free cash flow for the year of approximately 1x non-GAAP net income. Our cash flow forecast for this year now assumes that amortization of R&D costs under Section 174 of the U.S tax code will not be repealed within a time frame that will allow us to recover the accelerated tax payments that we made in 2022. While we believe that there is bipartisan support for this change, we are less confident than we were a quarter ago that this legislation will pass soon enough to help us this year. By way of reminder, this issue impacts the timing of tax payments and has an immaterial impact on our tax rate. If Section 174 is repealed within the next several months, our free cash flow would benefit by approximately $150M. Note that our cash flow guidance excludes the impact of transactional costs related to the pending Transporeon acquisition. While we are not offering quarterly guidance, a few factors are likely to impact the sequential evolution of our financial results as the year progresses. We expect organic revenue to be down in the first quarter and flat in the first half of the year, reflecting the strong growth in hardware and related offerings that we saw in the first half of 2022. We expect organic revenue to be up in the mid- to high-single digits in the second half of the year. Influenced by these revenue growth patterns, we expect operating and EBITDA margins to be relatively flat in the first half of the year, and up in the second half. While we expect mid-teens organic ARR growth for the year, growth in the first half is likely to be slightly lower driven by planned churn from a small number of customers. We expect ARR growth to improve sequentially through the year. From a segment perspective, we expect organic revenue growth for the year in the Building and Infrastructure, Resources and Utilities, and Transportation segments, with the strongest growth in Buildings and Infrastructure. Revenues in the Geospatial segment are expected to decline for the year, with the highest levels of organic decline in the first quarter as we lap strong numbers from the first quarter of 2022. Geospatial trends through 2023 will continue to be impacted by reductions in dealer inventory levels and ongoing softness in demand in a number of the segment's end markets. We expect margins to be stable in Buildings and Infrastructure and Resources and Utilities. We project growth in Transportation margins, while Geospatial margins will be down modestly for the year. Back to you Rob. Yes, hey, Rob. Its David Barnes. First point I'll make is that the supply chain, the constraints, and then the removed constraints has really moved trends around in our shipments, in our dealer inventory, that were hard to predict and in some cases, challenging to understand. So just by way of reminder, we had unsustainably and undesirably high hardware backlog early in 2022. Our supply chain even today isn't fully freed up, but to the extent that it freed up it happened very dramatically at the end of second quarter. So we shipped a lot of product, you'll recall that the hardware revenue was way up at that timeframe. So dealer inventories did grow. And I'll say it took us a while to figure out how quickly the dealers were able to find customers for and deploy that inventory. And that happened exactly while some of the end markets that our dealers serve slow, particularly in the geospatial side. There's probably the highest within Trimble level of exposure direct and indirect, to residential home construction, which slowed. There's some anxiety about the general economic outlook. So these two things happened all together, freeing up our supply chains, very big backlog, lots of shipments and I created the destocking that we talked about a quarter ago, and it has picked up. We're not through it yet. We think we have a pretty good sense of where our dealers want to be and where they will be over the sustained period of time. It's my guess that we'll have two more quarters, Q1 and Q2 of meaningful inventory reductions in our dealers and anything after that will be smaller. But the guidance we've given reflects that expectation. Yes, well, what I'll say is that we still do have isolated cases of supply challenges in our Ag, one of them. But I think at that point, they'll be -- so that there may be some reasons For dealers to have a little more inventory than they would have had pre-COVID, not much though. Supply is really good. Hey, Rob, the thing I remind you on as we look at this noise of one quarter to another, big increases in the first half of '22. And the decline, we just reported, Rob had a good chart in his presentation of the multiyear trend. We're still way above where we were. So we do think that a lot of this is the noise of the resetting of the supply chain. That's the bigger factor really than any fundamental change in demand. So from -- I'll start with the second part, the incremental cost is about 100 bps to the bottom line consistent with what we've we had this year as well. So that's the cost side of the equation. On the focus side of the equation, the digital transformation, there's a meta theme, its more than a system transformation for us. So, I think about people, I think about process and think about systems and the systems themselves. And then we think about the go-to-market specs of the digital transformation. And it's primarily focused right now on supporting our software businesses, particularly software businesses within buildings, and infrastructure. And that connects with the Trimble construction one dialogue that we've had with you and others. And so, first point of reference I look at is continuing to grow the ACB bookings, which is the leading indicator for the growth of the ARR. When we look at net retention as a key metric as well with inside that go-to-market. We look at the organization of the sales team itself and the go-to-market. So in France, Benelux, we've put the construction sales team together, software team as 1 organization. We've mostly done that in North America as well. And so it's getting the sales team aligned to sell consolidated offering of Trimble Construction One. And then with Trimble Construction One, it started out as a general -- targeted to general contractors and then we will be releasing more persona-based bundles. Remember, we sell to owners in the public sector. We sell to architects and engineers. So we have targeted portfolios to sell to those personas with the go-to-market team, a sales team that comes more and more together, as 1 organization to be enabled and equipped to sell everything that we do. On the system side, in the second quarter, we'll have the next, I'll say, big release of the systems. Those systems are meant to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our own sellers. And it moves closer and closer to having commerce capabilities -- e-commerce capabilities from an external -- with an external lens. On the people side, we continue to invest in customer success. And on the process side, we continue to invest in developing the playbooks for how we go-to-market starting with that software business, but then the next wave after that goes into software and other parts of Trimble and then into the hardware that we sell-through our dealer channels. And I was asked -- we got asked a question earlier in the call about visibility into dealers and their inventory. This is another reason that we think that the systems investments are a good thing for us to get increased levels of precision on that visibility. Hope that helps, Chad. Tami, it's David. The way to think about that is essentially all of the gross margin improvement is the evolving mix of our business. We are continuing to take price mostly in hardware, but at a lower rate so that's not real the margin driver. What's driving our margins up is we're becoming more and more of a software business and those have higher gross margins. Yes, hey Jason, its David Jason, it's David. We do expect churn from a handful of customers, principally in our Transportation segment. These are customers that made a decision to come off our platforms many quarters ago, and they're just now implementing them. So I see that as noise, not signal our customer satisfaction and retention in transportation is on a secular positive trend. We just expect to see a number of these probably in the first quarter pull off. So that will reduce our ARR growth rate a little bit lower in Q1 from what we expect to see for the full year. Excellent. Thanks. Welcome. Yes. Hey, Rob. It's David Barnes. I'll try both. On the Connect and Scale discrete investments spending on that '22versus '21 was about 100 basis points around $40 million. Embedded in our guidance for 2023 is a deceleration in the rate of growth. So we'll spend somewhere in the order of another $20 million or a little more than that, $1million incremental, $23 million above $22 million. We still have more to do and we are -- we believe this is a high priority investment. With regard to the model options, I would say the menu that we presented at the Investor Day is still out there. This topic is tied with digital transformation, our ability to sell hardware and software bundles together in recurring basis is heavily dependent on the rollout of our digital transformation. We're doing it in a somewhat [indiscernible] way now, but the bulk of that opportunity is ahead of us and all the options that we showed at the investors still options we're considering. We'll go next to [indiscernible] at Wolfe Research. Yes. Look, we've communicated the financial parameters there. We still don't own the business. Obviously, we're talking to them, but we have no update to our outlook, and we'll update that outlook once the transaction closes at some point in the first half of this year. Sure. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Michael Leyba for closing remarks."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Third Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer, you may begin.\nRob Painter: Welcome everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website; and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. Let\u2019s begin on Page 2 with our key messages. Total revenue in the quarter was $885 million, up 6%, yet short of our own higher expectations. Annualized recurring revenue met our expectations and grew 16% to a record level of $1.55 billion. Gross margin finished at a record level of 60.9%, exceeding our expectations. ARR and gross margin are the two-highlight metrics of the quarter. Software, services, and recurring revenue comprised 60% of revenue in the quarter, and 57% on a trailing 12-month basis. EBITDA margins of 25.8% and earnings per share of $0.66 also exceeded our expectations in the quarter. While ARR performed extraordinarily well in the quarter, demand for hardware and associated software fell short, especially late in the quarter. We expect this will continue through the fourth quarter. While detecting the signal through the noise is difficult at the moment, we attribute the weaker hardware demand to two factors. First, we see a relative weakening of overall sentiment, especially in Europe and in other regions negatively impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Second, we see our dealers, in aggregate, moderating their inventory levels in the back half of the year. This reflects their current sentiment, and also factors in some good news from our supply chains, which began to ease up and offer shorter lead times on our products. We see many parts of the global economy through the industries we serve. If we look at the overall economic indicators, I\u2019d say that, in aggregate, the indicators went from great to good. In agriculture, farm income remains high, but so does inflation. In construction, the overall indices are still net positive, but interest rates are beginning to have a negative impact on residential work, and inflation is eating into the increased funding from the U.S. bipartisan infrastructure bill. In transportation, although spot rates in the truckload market have softened due to normalizing demand, freight volume remains steady along with contract rates. Higher fuel prices continue to inflate overall transportation costs, yet trucking margins have remained relatively healthy, due to the strength of freight demand. Managing through these challenging economic and geopolitical landscapes presents a higher level of operational complexity. What is not complex is leading with guiding principles, which for us are threefold. First, we will take actions to exit an expected period of macroeconomic weakness on a stronger competitive footing. Second, we will continue to allocate capital to key areas of the business, such as our digital transformation. Third, we will increase our operational and cost efficiencies and work to reduce our own complexities and redundancies. With that in mind, I will comment on the business through the lens of our operating system, encompassing strategy, people, and execution. Let\u2019s start with strategy. On September 7, we held an Investor Day, where we walked through our Connect and Scale strategy and how it manifests as an industry cloud strategy. We talked about the unifying elements of Trimble and the market opportunity in front of us to digitize and connect some of the most important industries on the planet. We also discussed how our digital transformation will enable connected sales of solutions across a growing portion of our business and shared examples where we are already winning with connected solutions in the market. Finally, we talked about capital allocation and our commitment to transform more of our solution offerings to ratable revenue models, which we firmly believe offers customers more value while expanding the size of our addressable markets. ARR, EBITDA, and cash flow are key metrics for us in the coming years. In the last couple of weeks, we exhibited at the INTERGEO geospatial conference and Bauma construction trade shows, both in Germany, both well attended, and both with high levels of customer engagement. On November 7 through 9, we will hold Trimble Dimensions, our engineering and construction user conference, where we expect over 5,000 customers and partners to come together to connect and inspire transformation in our industry. Moving to people, on October 6, we announced that we changed our corporate headquarters to Westminster, Colorado. We\u2019ve also made some leadership changes. In August, Ron Bisio took over responsibility for our Transportation business. Last week, we announced that Peter Large will take responsibility for all of our construction assets, software and hardware, across civil and building construction.  Our Chief Digital Officer, Mark Schwartz, will take over responsibility for most of our construction software assets; and Pattie-Boothe will take over responsibility for our civil construction business. We now have single points of accountability to deliver outcomes in construction, agriculture, and transportation. Finally, on the topic of execution, let\u2019s review this in the context of our reporting segments. In Buildings and Infrastructure, we acquired Bid2Win on September 9, which is a great fit for our strategy. Bid2Win extends our software capabilities to estimating and operations in the heavy civil construction industry. At the segment level, [ACV bookings] [ph] growth in the quarter exceeded the level of ARR growth, giving us visibility to continued growth. We also continue to see success in cross-selling and up-selling new and existing logos with our early version of Trimble Construction One. We will continue to expand and automate this offering in the months to come. In geospatial, I spent three weeks in the Asia-Pacific region in September and met face-to-face with many customers there. I saw first-hand how they are using our surveying and mapping instruments and software-driven workflows to build the largest infrastructure projects under development in New Zealand and Australia. In Transportation, the business achieved double-digit operating income margin this quarter, for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019. While we still have a lot of work to do, it is worth noting that we are headed in the right direction. In Agriculture, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Bilberry, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter.  Bilberry specializes in selective spraying systems utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning for sustainable farming. We also signed an agreement with CLAAS to develop a next-generation precision farming system for their tractors, combines, and forage harvesters.  We launched our next generation GFX high-resolution touchscreen displays, targeted towards farmers that operate mixed fleets. These GFX displays are compatible with over 10,000 vehicle models across more than 40 equipment brands, and they are ISOBUS-compatible, which allows one display for ISOBUS implements, regardless of manufacturer. Overall, Trimble customers see technology as an increasingly important tool to manage the inflationary and labor shortages they face and to achieve their sustainability commitments. Our bundled solutions represent a unique competitive strength as we compete for our share of the growing industrial technology market. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to David to review our financial results and outlook in greater detail.\nDavid Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue of $885 million was up 6% organically. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 4%, while divestitures net of acquisitions also reduced revenue by 4%. Pricing drove slightly over half of our year-on-year organic revenue growth. Software and recurring revenue continued to grow at a strong rate as reflected by the sequential acceleration of our organic ARR growth.  Ongoing transitions of software models from perpetual to recurring, principally in our Transportation and Buildings and Infrastructure segments, contributed to our ARR momentum, but reduced revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 100 basis points. Hardware revenues grew modestly on an organic basis, enabled by reduced lead times and improving throughput from our supply chain.  Supply chain constraints continue to be dynamic in nature, but our team made good progress in the quarter working around these constraints and executed well in a challenging and unpredictable environment. Bookings for hardware products from our dealers declined sequentially from prior quarters and came in below our expectations, reflecting a softening demand environment in some of our end markets and lower dealer inventories.  Gross margin in the third quarter was a record 60.9%, up 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by an increasingly favorable business mix and the improving net impact of pricing and slowing input cost inflation. Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins were essentially flat year-over-year, and well above pre-COVID levels. Strong gross margins and lower accruals against our annual incentive plans fully offset the year-on-year impact of spending against our strategic initiatives.  Net income dollars decreased by 3% and earnings per share were flat year-over-year at $0.66 per share. Our trailing 12-month cash flow from operations was $440 million, and free cash flow was $389 million, both of which are down versus prior year. As we outlined in our last earnings call, inventory dynamics and a change in the U.S. tax law are adversely impacting our cash flows in 2022.  Our inventories are well above the levels we held before the supply chain shortages emerged in 2021, as we have been buying to support improved hardware lead times. And a provision in the U.S. tax law has resulted in the amortization of R&D costs for tax purposes beginning in 2022, which has meaningfully impacted the timing of tax payments. We expect both of these unusual factors will reverse in 2023, which will yield significant increases in cash flow and a more normalized relationship between earnings and cash flow going forward.  Note that the underlying working capital dynamics of our business remain strong, with essentially zero net working capital even at our temporarily higher levels of inventory. Notwithstanding a reduction in backlog from improved hardware lead times, we enter the fourth quarter with $1.5 billion in backlog, $1.3 billion of which supports future software, services and recurring revenue.  We ended the quarter with leverage measured as net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.4 times, giving us a resilient capital structure and the flexibility to invest where we see opportunity. This quarter we funded our acquisition of Bid2Win and completed $90 million in share repurchases. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends. On this and the next few pages I will focus on organic growth rates, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency fluctuations. ARR was up 16%, with strong bookings in construction and healthy net retention across our portfolio. Our non-recurring revenue streams grew modestly, with hardware up 3% year-over-year. As Rob mentioned earlier, our non-recurring revenues were below our expectations, driven by weaker end market demand in some markets, especially in Europe, and growing caution among our dealers on how much inventory they want to hold. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 10%. In Europe, where the macro-economic outlook contracted the most, revenues were down 3%. Asia-Pacific was up 4%, and the rest of world was up 21%. Next on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. ARR in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities all grew at a mid-teens or above rate, while Transportation ARR growth was high-single digits and improved sequentially. Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of our reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 12%. Revenue growth was strong across our software businesses in this segment, while our Civil Construction hardware revenue benefited from improved supply chain throughput. Segment ARR was up in the [20\u2019s] [ph] in the quarter. Geospatial segment revenue was up 1% over a very strong performance in the third quarter of 2021. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 9%, driven by improved throughput from our supply chain, strong demand from OEM customers, and continued growth in our positioning services. Financial results in Transportation showed progression in a number of areas. ARR growth and margins both improved for the fourth quarter in a row. We continue to progress in the conversion of our Transportation Enterprise software business to recurring revenue models. Turning now to Slide 9, I\u2019d like to provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. I\u2019ll start with ARR. Driven by our momentum in bookings and sustained high levels of net retention, our outlook for ARR growth is unchanged from what we shared with you last quarter. We continue to expect organic ARR growth of approximately 16%. Turning to revenue, we now project organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the full-year, which is 300 basis points below the outlook we shared with you in August. For the full-year we expect that changes in foreign exchange rates will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by 3%, while divestitures net of acquisitions will also reduce revenue by 3%. We expect operating margins for the full-year of approximately 23%, which is consistent with the range we shared with you in August. Our outlook for gross margins has improved, driven both by an improving business mix and a more positive outlook for pricing and costs. We project that our improving gross margins and strong operating cost control will offset the adverse impact of lower leverage on our fixed costs. Our forecast for income from equity investments is approximately $28 million and net interest costs are estimated to be approximately $66 million. Our tax rate guidance is a range of 18% to 18.5%. Taken in aggregate, we now expect full-year 2022 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $2.61 and $2.67 per share. From a cash flow perspective, we now expect the ratio of free cash flow to non-GAAP net income to be 0.5x to 0.6x for the year, with the primary impacts continuing to be Section 174 tax payments and inventory dynamics. We continue to expect to deliver 2023 free cash flow well above non-GAAP net income as these factors reverse. From a segment perspective, in the fourth quarter we expect organic growth rates to moderate in the Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities segments driven entirely by lower year-on-year revenues from hardware. In the Transportation segment, we expect the growth rate to improve sequentially. ARR growth should remain relatively consistent with recent trends in each of our segments. We expect to issue 2023 guidance in February, but at this point we anticipate a 2023 outlook for double-digit ARR growth and strong cash flow generation. Rob, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.\nRob Painter: Thanks David. Let me acknowledge that global market conditions have become more difficult. I also think that perspective is important. ARR at $1.55 billion and up 16% is a remarkable achievement and puts us in the upper echelon of technology companies. Our survey, agriculture, and civil construction hardware revenues, when factoring in our current 2022 forecast, have grown at a compound annual growth rate of over 13% since 2019. The data we have suggests that we have gained share in each of these end markets over the last three years, and we remain pleased with our performance and the strategic health of these businesses. Looking forward, we will stay true to our 3-4-3 model, simultaneously balancing a view on 3 months, 4 quarters, and 3 years. In the short-term, we will more tightly manage headcount and discretionary costs, while continuing to transform our business models. In the mid-term, we are planning for persistent economic uncertainty, and we will be sharper on our capital allocation to invest in key areas of the business without cutting into any muscle. In the long-term, the durability of our business is stronger than ever, and our markets are inflecting with the adoption of digital technologies. This remains our moment to Connect and Scale and we are as committed as ever to this strategic journey. Operator, let\u2019s open the line to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning everyone.\nRob Painter: Good morning, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Rob, I wonder if you can just say a bit more about the ARR performance in the quarter? What was it in buildings and infrastructure in particular and nice to hear about the double-digit outlook into 2023. I'm wondering if you could just give us an update on what's the cadence of bookings growth? Are you seeing maybe into the first half of 2023? You probably have some pretty good visibility on putting a more precise number based on bookings where ARR could track over the next 6 to 9 months? Thanks.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Jerry. So, ARR, for the total company organic was 16% in the quarter and Buildings and Infrastructure was 21% and it was actually also above 20% in the Geospatial reporting segment. So, it's a strong performance overall. ARR arguably is a lagging indicator, the leading indicator is bookings. So, with respect to your question of looking into Q4 and into 2023, when we look at the ACV bookings, contract value bookings that we had in Q3, those grew faster organically in the ARR in the quarter and that's a really solid leading indicator for continued ARR growth to come.\nJerry Revich: Super. And David, can I ask about the fourth quarter? So, obviously, you took down expectations. Normally, when you have a destocking adjustment like we're seeing, you have generally a disproportionate impact on margins in the short-term. Is that playing out in the fourth quarter? Anything we should keep in mind about the earnings cadence off of this fourth quarter levels as we think about the cadence into [2023] [ph], any costs or inefficiencies from making the adjustment that you folks spoke about in the prepared remarks?\nDavid Barnes: Yes, Jerry, I understand your question. There's no real negative margin impact to the outlook we have. In fact, the embedded in our guidance as you do the math, you'll see we expect to have very high gross margins in Q4 even higher than Q3 and that's a function of a business mix, which will be more software centric and we'll have more of the net benefit of the prices we've taken and moderating cost inflation. So, Q4 will be really good from a gross margin perspective.\nJerry Revich: And so the negative revision to full-year operating margins, was the third quarter versus your model, David?\nDavid Barnes: This is a little bit of, I'll call it [noise] [ph] between Q3 and Q4 with the reduction in our outlook or forecast for the year, we brought down our accrual against our incentive comp. So, just the incentive comp helped Q3 margins by a little under 200 basis points and that gets normalized in Q4. So, that's really the driver of the expectation of lower margins in Q4 than Q3, but the underlying gross margins will be better and the OpEx as a percent of revenue will look higher, but that's the impact of the accounting for the bonus plans.\nJerry Revich: Okay. I appreciate the discussion. Thank you. The next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRob Wertheimer: Hi. Thanks and good morning everybody. Rob, I wonder if you could just drill down a little bit more on where you're seeing it going from great to good and the hardware weakness. I mean, I guess it wouldn't be surprising to see Europe or [European ag] [ph], but I don't know what sounds like maybe you're seeing more than just that. So, that's just a starting point. I think the quarter has generally been pretty okay across industrials and it seems like you're seeing a few more spots of weakness?\nRob Painter: Hey, good morning, Rob. Hey, the first comment on the great to good was at the overall company level. If I think about the dynamics and hardware revenue, let's say, compared to other companies that you're following. Let's talk about retail versus the wholesale and then I think you also have to take into account units and pricing. So, at a retail sell-through like visibility we have is that the retail sell-through is quite solid. So, actually dealers are bringing down inventory levels, but the retail demand is still there. So, what I would characterize in my sentiment is that the goodness is still there. So, our \u2013 and I've seen some others, the revenue in their third quarters was more to wholesale demand, meeting wholesale demand. In other words, building up dealer inventory at AR as we saw dealer inventory reduction, but the retail demand was a sell-through. And then with respect to pricing in units, I think one thing that to me I'd characterize in the good side for our hardware business is, we're getting still a fair amount of our growth that's happening through unit growth. So, this is not all pricing. And then another just thing in terms of setting perspective overall from the \u2013 if I go \u2013 we are going back to 2019 is, we've got a CAGR of 13% in [some of] [ph] our survey agriculture and civil construction hardware revenue. So, if I expand the horizon a bit, I can still see through what has been a very positive track record in the business. So that's \u2013 Rob, that's how they come to the great to good and [indiscernible] to your question. Let me know if you have a follow-up.\nRob Wertheimer: Yes. Rob, that's helpful. Is the dealer conservatism geographically in product equal or is it concentrated or heavily concentrated in a couple of products or regions?\nRob Painter: Well, for sure concentrated in Europe as a geography. And then if I took it at a product level, I'd say a mix of civil construction and agriculture.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in line.\nOperator: The next question is from Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nKristen Owen: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Good morning. Transportation margin, you called that out as having been one of the highest since 2019. Clearly, there's some seasonality that we would expect to see in 3Q, but I'm wondering if you can talk about some of the successes that you're seeing in that business, where we are in terms of net new business and how we should think about the exit rate for that segment just given some of the changes you've made over the last two years? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Good morning, Kristen. Yes, so, I guess a couple more data points in there, sequential growth in ARR. Our gross margins are the highest in that business since Q4 of 2018. Our OpEx is at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2020. We've seen net retention in a pretty good place. In the enterprise business, I think of, essentially more of the ERP side of the transportation business. We continue conversions from our customers from on-prem to cloud. So, I like what we're doing there and we're moving more of our bookings, continue to move more of the bookings to subscription bookings. So, that's a positive for us and actually that's of course that's a headwind to the margin. So, they would have been a probably 150 bps to 200 bps higher or not for that. So, if I look at the quantitative side of the house there, I like a level of the momentum or at least a direction, maybe I should call direction that the business is moving. The mapping business that we have continues to perform extraordinarily well both in North America and in Europe. At our User Conference in August, we announced a number of new products integrations that we have, including the engage lane technology, which is coming out of some work that we have done with Procter & Gamble. So, a number of good things happening, Kristen.\nKristen Owen: That's helpful and encouraging to hear. The follow-up question that I have is just around capital allocation location. You're now at nearly 400 million shares repurchased for the year, just remind us how you think about repurchases relative to intrinsic value expectations? Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: Yes. Hey, Kristen, it's David. We have a model where we're looking at our cash flow with some moderation this year. We're a cash flow generating business. We did some divestitures earlier in the year. And we look to make sure we have the right capital structure for our business and fund our growth plans and we use a matrix when the share price comes down that gives us an opportunity to be a bit more aggressive. Over time, the focus of our capital allocation is on growth and we won't have share repurchase get in the way of giving us firepower to invest in growth. Our leverage at 1.4x is actually below where we think we could be on a long-term basis. And so, we were comfortable bumping it up a little bit based on all those variables.\nKristen Owen: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Tami Zakaria with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So, my first question is, this may be a little early to ask this, but how are you thinking about gross margin next year as cost inflation is retreating? Can you remind us how much of margin headwind you saw, let's say, in the past couple of years from cost inflation alone? And can you \u2013 do you expect to recapture most of it maybe over the next 12 to 18 months?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. Hey, Tami, it's David. I'll start by saying, I'm going to be careful not to give 2023 guidance. We will do that in February, but I'll talk about some broad trends that I think are likely to influence our margins going forward. On the gross margin side, we think there's a macro trend here of higher growth in our software businesses and recurring, which has higher gross margins. So that will help us. We think with humility that the world is uncertain, but we're past the peak of input cost inflation on the hardware side. We've taken price, I'll say some of you are comparing us with other industrial companies. We've taken actually less price if you just look as a percentage price increase than some of the big industrial players. And we think that makes sense given our economics and our focus on staying competitive, but we think within hardware, we'll see continued moderation of costs and we'll have pricing that can keep up with that maybe do a little bit better. With that said, we're investing against our strategic priorities that we mentioned in the Investor Day. And so, I think we have some levers to pull on with regard to margin. As Rob mentioned in his commentary, we're looking at the softening demand environment and we're being increasingly careful and prudent in our costs. We are every day, every month looking at our internal resource capital allocation. We've slowed down the rate of our hiring and our cost additions and we will continue to be really prudent understanding that the demand environment next year is going to be hard to predict. So, hopefully that gives you the picture you need. We'll have more to say about this in February.\nTami Zakaria: It does. It was very helpful. Thank you. And then a second quick one. Europe, I think organic growth was negative in the quarter. You call that civil construction and Ag demand, I think, you call that as moderating. Did you see order trends sequentially get worse quarter to date versus 3Q? I guess what I'm trying to understand is, when do you think Europe can \u2013 how long do you think Europe will stay in the negative territory before it, sort of inflects and bounces back?\nRob Painter: Hey, good morning, Tami. This is Rob. So, that's a great question and I wish I had a crystal ball for everything you're asking inside that. Hey, the level set on the Q, the organic growth was about minus 3%. But I first want to make a note on that is that includes our Russia and Ukraine business, which went away. So, we adjust for that and we were a positive 2% organic in the quarter. So, that's where we put our Russia and Ukraine numbers. And so, we haven't to try to make adjustments for that in any of the organic like we called it as it was. So, that loss of that business has been a negative for us both in Europe and obviously at the company level as well. Now, the Europe growth is slower than what we saw organically, and rest of world, which is up [20%] [ph], which is mostly Brazil, APAC was higher than that in North America at around 10% organic level. I think there's an aspect first is the dealer inventory reset. So, I think to really get ground truth as I go back to separating the retail and the wholesale demand. I'll say it is confusing at the moment. I'm a bit uncertain out there. We walked away from the trade shows where we spend a lot of time with engineering construction customers predominantly European based at the two shows at the Intergeo and Bauma and actually sentiment and engagement in attendance was very high. We look at infrastructure projects, the HS2, the Grand Paris. There is infrastructure work happening in Europe. So, in that sense, I'm positive on continued business in Europe residential I think is turning. Markets like EPC work are, I think will be solid for obvious reasons in Europe, but those do take time. Farm income and farm sentiment, that has a [indiscernible] sort of correlate to harvest and whether as that comes together, it ended up being a harder year for European farmers than I think they thought earlier in the year. As you know, there was \u2013 so that was pretty dry in Europe and then that impacted sentiment. So, we'll see how they [feel] [ph], let's say, coming into the spring planting season. So, there's little \u2013 some winds going, but winds going both ways in Europe at the moment. But hey, despite all of that, I go back to what do we do at Trimble, we sell productivity and sustainability and I think the value proposition of technology is just as important as ever.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. That's super helpful color. Thank you.\nRob Painter: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from Erik Lapinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErik Lapinski: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick one on, kind of operating margins more at the segment level and focusing on geospatial because that was particularly strong in the quarter. I guess just trying to understand maybe better the driver there, given revenue didn't increase as much? I know it's more, kind of hardware oriented. So, volume, I typically think of as the driver there. So, maybe if you could help us, kind of understand just that side of it?\nDavid Barnes : Yes. Hey, Erik, it's David. Margins were particularly good in geospatial and that's mostly a mix issue within the offerings and we think that's a little bit better than we're going to have in Q4. So, it's just a mix of the products that we sell and what we shipped in Q3 was particularly high margin.\nErik Lapinski: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then also you did mention some success on the recurring offerings within the geospatial segment. Can you maybe give us some color on to exactly, kind of where you're seeing that success? I know that's been an initiative for you guys.\nDavid Barnes: Sure. Well, in the \u2013 of the four segments, the geospatial does start with the lowest base. So, in terms of percentage increase to be intellectually honest, it's coming off that lower base. And the team deserves credit for the pivoting of the business model. So, when you buy our instruments and sensors like the hardware centric part of geospatial, so think the surveyors and the [Mappers] [ph] out there in the world, they're buying workflow, actually, they're not just buying an instrument and that workflow includes software. So, we have Trimble business and Trimble access. So, these field to finish workflows that the field needs or if you're doing scanning data or mobile mapping, data collection, you need to be able to process that data. So, the software that we have in that business is being converted more into ratable models, which we think is expands the size of the addressable market, turns the CapEx and the OpEx is helping us as a catalyst to move more of the work into to the cloud. So, in that sense, Erik, yes, I think it's a very good example of connect and scale at play.\nErik Lapinski: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. \nJason Celino: Great. Thanks. Two quick ones for me. You know, there's been lots of questions on hardware already, but maybe I\u2019ll ask it a different way. So, hardware was down 11% in Q3. And then Q4, I think you said it will be down high-single-digits. Maybe this is just the function to compare, but I guess why? Why wouldn't or, I guess, high single-digit decline is [indiscernible]?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. Hey, Jason. I'll point out that really important when you look at hardware to get the organic math in your mind. And that's both FX and we divested businesses, which were heavily hardware centric. So, actually if you look at the organic numbers, hardware revenues were up 3% year-on-year in Q3. And that does reflect that we were \u2013 our product supply improves a lot and we were able to draw down the backlog and meet the dealer needs where we've had extraordinarily long lead times. So, that having said, embedded within our guidance is that hardware organic revenues are likely to be down in the fourth quarter and it's driven by all the dynamics Rob mentioned.\nJason Celino: Okay. Perfect. No. That's actually very helpful. And then Rob, you know, two quarters in a row, 20% [indiscernible] in B&I and the leading indicators with ACV also look good, how much of the strength do you think is from some of the new bundling efforts versus strong environment for [construction market] [ph]? Thanks.\nRob Painter: Good morning, Jason. I think there's some growth in that. Our crossed up bookings and part of the business within B&I that's selling Trimble Construction One, we saw over 20% of our ACV bookings coming from cross-sell. And as we've talked about at Investor Day, we're still very early in the work with TC1, I\u2019m expanding that offering into different geographies and broadening the scope and the automation of the offering. So, I think that there's only tailwinds behind the business model aspect of that. And then if I flip it around, let's say, for the rest of the business. The software side at B&I does have incrementally more American centricity to it, which is the healthiest of the four geographies that we report. So that, I think would also help that as well.\nJason Celino : All right. Thanks.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: The next question is from Gal Munda with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nGal Munda: Hey, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. The first one, maybe Rob, if you think, you mentioned in Europe the infrastructure is actually looking quite good, but if I want to try to think about the infrastructure opportunity, right now in the way you've seen potentially, especially in the U.S., have you seen any of the tailwind from IIJA\u2019s starting to come in or do you think that's something that could actually start being material to the business as we move into the 2020?\nRob Painter: Hi, good morning, Gal. So, we do continue to feel that the IIJA versus now, I guess, BIO, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, [indiscernible] that's gone into law. We continue to believe it's a positive catalyst for business. And that 10% organic growth in overall North America at the total company level clearly has a B&I and geospatial aspect to that. So, call that engineering and construction if we up level. Money is starting to flow from the federal government to the states.  When you look again at the state level, some states actually have multiple funding sources for their infrastructure like they're not entirely dependent on the incremental money from the Fed. And that's interesting to us because there are subset of states in the U.S. that are, I'd say, they're at work already and we're seeing good activity from those states.  If I take the majority of the states though, I think one of the things that's on the headwind side of the infrastructure bill is that material cost and labor cost are eating into some of the increased amount of the funding. And there still does seem to be a lag between the funding mechanism and the work actually starting to happen. And so, we feel like there's been a lag and we're not really seeing the fruits of it at, at a \u2013 let's say a level we might have expected at this point. So, now you weren't asking so much about 2022 as looking forward. So, if we go into next year, I think that that does provide us, let's say, a certain level of ballast to the business and our sentiment certainly for the North American side of Trimble engineering and construction. \nGal Munda: That makes sense. Thank you. And then if I think about the pricing that you've mentioned as being, kind of one of the drivers and especially on the gross margin side, but if I take a step back and just think about the pricing in general, can you talk a little bit more about what you found on the pricing maybe when you look at hardware versus software split? Have you done any significant price increases in the software side or are you planning to do anything there as we ramp the next year? Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: Hey Gal, it\u2019s David. So, we've taken more pricing in hardware than software. Software pricing is a little, sort of amorphous because you're always adding more features and how much do you attribute to more functionality versus the price. It's been our practice to increase pricing over time in our software businesses and we've [uped] [ph] that a little bit with the inflationary environment, but more of our price increases have been against our hardware.  And just to put some numbers around it, if you look year-on-year and we've taken several ways of price increases. Across our hardware portfolio, our prices year-on-year are up about 6%. So that's the rate of headline inflation. Good news for us is that the rate of inflation of our cost is actually less than that. So, we're getting some hardware margin benefit from the net impact of [pricing and cost] [ph]. But the pricing on the software is less than [six] [ph], where you can think of that in the low single digits or little less than 5% pricing on our software.\nGal Munda: That's really helpful. Thank you, David.\nOperator: The next question is from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on your ARR growth and whether that's coming from net expansion versus new customers, as well as whether there's been any, sort of change in that dynamic?\nRob Painter: Good morning, Jonathan. Hey, it's Rob. So, there's certainly a number of, let's say, levers directions where we've seen the ARR grow. So, first, I'll take expanding the size of the addressable market and our best example of that is from our SketchUp product within buildings and infrastructure. I think we're going on 13 or 14 quarters in a row of more than 40% ARR growth in that business is really remarkable. So, kudos to the team on that. And you're not doing that through pricing, you're doing that through unit and where those kind of unit growth, that's a clear sign to us of expanding the size of the addressable market. We weren't expanding units at that level prior to the model conversion. We see it in our [indiscernible] business, as well as that we're seeing unit growth, which we think is showing a sign of expanding the size of addressable market. Second, I could put in a category of say, general market uplift or adoption of technology. You can argue that's riding a wave, so to speak, of digitization and the market that provides a certain level of growth in the ARR and the business. The third category I would call the cross-sell, and when we really get to the economics of the connected scale strategy and think about the 1.55 billion of ARR we're sitting on top of, we think that there's a couple hundred million plus of ARR to be mined, just from within the portfolio we have. And so, as I think about economic scenarios if the economy were to take a turn for the worse, you know your classic play is to look what the customers you have and rethink the amount of capital you're putting to new logo generation. So, I'm optimistic that whatever the scenario is that there's a lot to be done from within our own portfolio. And I'll say that fourth and last category is straight up new logo growth. So, the sum of those to me is the sum of parts that gets to the total company level.\nJonathan Ho: That's helpful. And then you mentioned a number of management and leadership transitions at the beginning. Can you talk a little bit more about the dynamics there and maybe what you were, sort of looking for as you were, I guess, making some changes at the second tier management level? Thank you.\nRob Painter : Well, I'd say congratulations to the folks who are stepping into new roles. 100% believers in them and the work that they've got ahead of them. So, I think that change can be a good thing. Change provides opportunity. Change provides a chance for a fresh look at some things. Sometimes leadership transitions, I'd say, are \u2013 that's the right thing for the business. And as you proactively make them other times, you're reacting because somebody decides to leave the organization. So, there's a little bit of both of those that provide a backdrop in context for the transitions that we have in mind. The tone I'd want to set on the transitions that we have is that it's about executing connect and scale at the strategy level. Our operating system talks about strategy, people and execution. So, the strategy is to connect and scale manifesting through these industry clouds that we're building, bringing the best capabilities we have together. So, our leaders, all of us, myself included every single one of our operators and folks who work to support the operators are working to build the product offering to meet this platform and industry cloud direction that we're going. At a people level, we aim to continue to be the employer of choice and technology and our rankings in that area continue to be world-class.  So, I expect some leaders to lead, to inspire, to engage, to achieve. And then we've got to meet our numbers on the execution and so you know how much weight we put towards the ARR growth in the business. When we talk about our three key metrics, we're talking about ARR, EBITDA, and cash flow. So, we have to not just talk in package, we have to deliver, and we have to deliver in an environment that's got an increasing level of uncertainty around it. So, that's the expectation I have for the leaders who were in their roles and I got a great deal of belief in them to be able to do so.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you so much.\nRob Painter: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good morning, guys.\nRob Painter: Hi, Chad.\nChad Dillard: So, I just want to circle back on your implied guidance for gross margins in the fourth quarter and just how to think about that exit rate, just given that, it sounds like mix will be a tailwind, you get a little bit better price cost and start to think about that as a starting point as we look towards 2023?\nDavid Barnes: Hey Chad, it's David. As you do through the math, go through the math and look at our guidance, you'll see that we expect meaningful improvement in gross margins from Q3 to Q4 and that's driven by a mix, our hardware revenues even organically will be down in the fourth quarter for all the reasons that Rob mentioned. So, the software to hardware mix is going to improve and we have the benefit within hardware, particularly of a favorable mix between pricing and cost. So that gets you to gross margins. OpEx as a percent of revenue will be higher because we had \u2013 we have the bonus impact that I described to an earlier question where we had, call it, no bonus expense in Q3. That's the way the approval works. We also have some step-up in OpEx Q3 to Q4 sequentially. It\u2019s the way holiday's work in Europe and we have a big user conference coming up. So, those dynamics will drive our OpEx as a percent of revenue, higher in Q3 and Q4 with lower revenue unit that all out we expect operating margins to be lower in Q4 versus Q3.\nChad Dillard: Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe, if you could just spend some time just talking about the impact of the digital transformation that you've been embarking on for the last 12 months. Just trying to think about the incremental spend from, I guess 2021, 2022 and then just any early thoughts on how you think about that as we go into this coming year and just the cadence of the expected benefit?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. We are \u2013 I'll say the guidance, the framework we provided earlier in the year and last quarter still holds we're investing against our digital transformation and a handful of other strategic initiatives at a rate that's about 100 basis points of margin. So, that's what it was in Q3. And that's what it will be in Q4. We're looking harder at OpEx everywhere, but as Rob said, what we're not doing is changing our fundamental priorities and progressing against the digital transformation is absolutely at the top of our strategic list. So, that you can call that pressure is there and we're managing to hold our model within the context of sustaining that investment going forward.\nChad Dillard: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is open.\nRob Mason: Yes, good morning everyone. Apologies if this has been asked. I\u2019m toggling back and forth between calls, but there was the commentary around your backlog, I think David, I inferred about 200 million of hardware backlog, I'm just curious if that's the right number? And then two is, how are you thinking about where dealers are in terms of rightsizing their inventory? Just the dynamic there, is this situation that can be resolved, do you think here between third quarter and fourth quarter or does it stretch beyond that?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. So, I'll start with the numbers. You're about right. Our hardware backlog went from about 240 million at the end of last quarter to 180 million so down 60 million, which is a good thing that reflects the fact that our supply chain is improving. Pre-COVID, pre-supply chain, that number was closer to a hundred. So, we will move in that direction, although I'm not sure we\u2019ll ever get back to where it was because supply chains are likely to be different for everybody going forward. As far as dealer dynamics, it's a very dynamic situation. It varies dealer-to-dealer market-to-market. I'd say overall most dealers are about where they have been and probably about where they want to be. As Rob mentioned, the dealers are looking at their markets and are seeing some uncertainty and so their sort of set point for inventory is going down and that's somewhat accelerated by the fact that our supply chain has now gotten so good, not universally, but for most of our products, we have order lead times measured in days, not months. And so, the need to hold a bunch of inventory for the dealer is less than it was. So, it's a mix. There are some dealers that are looking at uncertainty in their markets and will be inclined, particularly with our good supply chain to bring inventories down and some are in very good shape.\nRob Mason: And just with respect to the agriculture business, there was commentary in the slides around softening demand in Europe, but did you comment on North America and how that market is faring for you?\nRob Painter: Well, hey, Rob, this is the other Rob. In the Ag business overall, actually the majority of our business, I want to frame is outside of North America today. So, strong double-digit growth in Brazil, really in South America, continued growth in Asia Pacific. Overall organically, the business was up in the high-single-digits for agriculture. So, I think North America is holding its own as the punch line on that, but I want to put North America in the context of the bigger picture.\nRob Mason: Very good. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions. At this time, I'll turn it over to Michael Leyba for any closing remarks.\nMichael Leyba: Thank you, everyone, for joining us this quarter. We look forward to speaking to you again soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website; and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. Let's begin on Page 2 with our key messages. Total revenue in the quarter was $885 million, up 6%, yet short of our own higher expectations. Annualized recurring revenue met our expectations and grew 16% to a record level of $1.55 billion. Gross margin finished at a record level of 60.9%, exceeding our expectations. ARR and gross margin are the two-highlight metrics of the quarter. Software, services, and recurring revenue comprised 60% of revenue in the quarter, and 57% on a trailing 12-month basis. EBITDA margins of 25.8% and earnings per share of $0.66 also exceeded our expectations in the quarter. While ARR performed extraordinarily well in the quarter, demand for hardware and associated software fell short, especially late in the quarter. We expect this will continue through the fourth quarter. While detecting the signal through the noise is difficult at the moment, we attribute the weaker hardware demand to two factors. First, we see a relative weakening of overall sentiment, especially in Europe and in other regions negatively impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar. Second, we see our dealers, in aggregate, moderating their inventory levels in the back half of the year. This reflects their current sentiment, and also factors in some good news from our supply chains, which began to ease up and offer shorter lead times on our products. We see many parts of the global economy through the industries we serve. If we look at the overall economic indicators, I'd say that, in aggregate, the indicators went from great to good. In agriculture, farm income remains high, but so does inflation. In construction, the overall indices are still net positive, but interest rates are beginning to have a negative impact on residential work, and inflation is eating into the increased funding from the U.S. bipartisan infrastructure bill. In transportation, although spot rates in the truckload market have softened due to normalizing demand, freight volume remains steady along with contract rates. Higher fuel prices continue to inflate overall transportation costs, yet trucking margins have remained relatively healthy, due to the strength of freight demand. Managing through these challenging economic and geopolitical landscapes presents a higher level of operational complexity. What is not complex is leading with guiding principles, which for us are threefold. First, we will take actions to exit an expected period of macroeconomic weakness on a stronger competitive footing. Second, we will continue to allocate capital to key areas of the business, such as our digital transformation. Third, we will increase our operational and cost efficiencies and work to reduce our own complexities and redundancies. With that in mind, I will comment on the business through the lens of our operating system, encompassing strategy, people, and execution. Let's start with strategy. On September 7, we held an Investor Day, where we walked through our Connect and Scale strategy and how it manifests as an industry cloud strategy. We talked about the unifying elements of Trimble and the market opportunity in front of us to digitize and connect some of the most important industries on the planet. We also discussed how our digital transformation will enable connected sales of solutions across a growing portion of our business and shared examples where we are already winning with connected solutions in the market. Finally, we talked about capital allocation and our commitment to transform more of our solution offerings to ratable revenue models, which we firmly believe offers customers more value while expanding the size of our addressable markets. ARR, EBITDA, and cash flow are key metrics for us in the coming years. In the last couple of weeks, we exhibited at the INTERGEO geospatial conference and Bauma construction trade shows, both in Germany, both well attended, and both with high levels of customer engagement. On November 7 through 9, we will hold Trimble Dimensions, our engineering and construction user conference, where we expect over 5,000 customers and partners to come together to connect and inspire transformation in our industry. Moving to people, on October 6, we announced that we changed our corporate headquarters to Westminster, Colorado. We've also made some leadership changes. In August, Ron Bisio took over responsibility for our Transportation business. Last week, we announced that Peter Large will take responsibility for all of our construction assets, software and hardware, across civil and building construction.  Our Chief Digital Officer, Mark Schwartz, will take over responsibility for most of our construction software assets; and Pattie-Boothe will take over responsibility for our civil construction business. We now have single points of accountability to deliver outcomes in construction, agriculture, and transportation. Finally, on the topic of execution, let's review this in the context of our reporting segments. In Buildings and Infrastructure, we acquired Bid2Win on September 9, which is a great fit for our strategy. Bid2Win extends our software capabilities to estimating and operations in the heavy civil construction industry. At the segment level, [ACV bookings] [ph] growth in the quarter exceeded the level of ARR growth, giving us visibility to continued growth. We also continue to see success in cross-selling and up-selling new and existing logos with our early version of Trimble Construction One. We will continue to expand and automate this offering in the months to come. In geospatial, I spent three weeks in the Asia-Pacific region in September and met face-to-face with many customers there. I saw first-hand how they are using our surveying and mapping instruments and software-driven workflows to build the largest infrastructure projects under development in New Zealand and Australia. In Transportation, the business achieved double-digit operating income margin this quarter, for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019. While we still have a lot of work to do, it is worth noting that we are headed in the right direction. In Agriculture, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Bilberry, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter.  Bilberry specializes in selective spraying systems utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning for sustainable farming. We also signed an agreement with CLAAS to develop a next-generation precision farming system for their tractors, combines, and forage harvesters.  We launched our next generation GFX high-resolution touchscreen displays, targeted towards farmers that operate mixed fleets. These GFX displays are compatible with over 10,000 vehicle models across more than 40 equipment brands, and they are ISOBUS-compatible, which allows one display for ISOBUS implements, regardless of manufacturer. Overall, Trimble customers see technology as an increasingly important tool to manage the inflationary and labor shortages they face and to achieve their sustainability commitments. Our bundled solutions represent a unique competitive strength as we compete for our share of the growing industrial technology market. I'll now turn the call over to David to review our financial results and outlook in greater detail. Thanks David. Let me acknowledge that global market conditions have become more difficult. I also think that perspective is important. ARR at $1.55 billion and up 16% is a remarkable achievement and puts us in the upper echelon of technology companies. Our survey, agriculture, and civil construction hardware revenues, when factoring in our current 2022 forecast, have grown at a compound annual growth rate of over 13% since 2019. The data we have suggests that we have gained share in each of these end markets over the last three years, and we remain pleased with our performance and the strategic health of these businesses. Looking forward, we will stay true to our 3-4-3 model, simultaneously balancing a view on 3 months, 4 quarters, and 3 years. In the short-term, we will more tightly manage headcount and discretionary costs, while continuing to transform our business models. In the mid-term, we are planning for persistent economic uncertainty, and we will be sharper on our capital allocation to invest in key areas of the business without cutting into any muscle. In the long-term, the durability of our business is stronger than ever, and our markets are inflecting with the adoption of digital technologies. This remains our moment to Connect and Scale and we are as committed as ever to this strategic journey. Operator, let's open the line to questions. Good morning, Jerry. Thanks, Jerry. So, ARR, for the total company organic was 16% in the quarter and Buildings and Infrastructure was 21% and it was actually also above 20% in the Geospatial reporting segment. So, it's a strong performance overall. ARR arguably is a lagging indicator, the leading indicator is bookings. So, with respect to your question of looking into Q4 and into 2023, when we look at the ACV bookings, contract value bookings that we had in Q3, those grew faster organically in the ARR in the quarter and that's a really solid leading indicator for continued ARR growth to come. Hey, good morning, Rob. Hey, the first comment on the great to good was at the overall company level. If I think about the dynamics and hardware revenue, let's say, compared to other companies that you're following. Let's talk about retail versus the wholesale and then I think you also have to take into account units and pricing. So, at a retail sell-through like visibility we have is that the retail sell-through is quite solid. So, actually dealers are bringing down inventory levels, but the retail demand is still there. So, what I would characterize in my sentiment is that the goodness is still there. So, our \u2013 and I've seen some others, the revenue in their third quarters was more to wholesale demand, meeting wholesale demand. In other words, building up dealer inventory at AR as we saw dealer inventory reduction, but the retail demand was a sell-through. And then with respect to pricing in units, I think one thing that to me I'd characterize in the good side for our hardware business is, we're getting still a fair amount of our growth that's happening through unit growth. So, this is not all pricing. And then another just thing in terms of setting perspective overall from the \u2013 if I go \u2013 we are going back to 2019 is, we've got a CAGR of 13% in [some of] [ph] our survey agriculture and civil construction hardware revenue. So, if I expand the horizon a bit, I can still see through what has been a very positive track record in the business. So that's \u2013 Rob, that's how they come to the great to good and [indiscernible] to your question. Let me know if you have a follow-up. Well, for sure concentrated in Europe as a geography. And then if I took it at a product level, I'd say a mix of civil construction and agriculture. Good morning, Kristen. Yes, so, I guess a couple more data points in there, sequential growth in ARR. Our gross margins are the highest in that business since Q4 of 2018. Our OpEx is at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2020. We've seen net retention in a pretty good place. In the enterprise business, I think of, essentially more of the ERP side of the transportation business. We continue conversions from our customers from on-prem to cloud. So, I like what we're doing there and we're moving more of our bookings, continue to move more of the bookings to subscription bookings. So, that's a positive for us and actually that's of course that's a headwind to the margin. So, they would have been a probably 150 bps to 200 bps higher or not for that. So, if I look at the quantitative side of the house there, I like a level of the momentum or at least a direction, maybe I should call direction that the business is moving. The mapping business that we have continues to perform extraordinarily well both in North America and in Europe. At our User Conference in August, we announced a number of new products integrations that we have, including the engage lane technology, which is coming out of some work that we have done with Procter & Gamble. So, a number of good things happening, Kristen. Hey, good morning, Tami. This is Rob. So, that's a great question and I wish I had a crystal ball for everything you're asking inside that. Hey, the level set on the Q, the organic growth was about minus 3%. But I first want to make a note on that is that includes our Russia and Ukraine business, which went away. So, we adjust for that and we were a positive 2% organic in the quarter. So, that's where we put our Russia and Ukraine numbers. And so, we haven't to try to make adjustments for that in any of the organic like we called it as it was. So, that loss of that business has been a negative for us both in Europe and obviously at the company level as well. Now, the Europe growth is slower than what we saw organically, and rest of world, which is up [20%] [ph], which is mostly Brazil, APAC was higher than that in North America at around 10% organic level. I think there's an aspect first is the dealer inventory reset. So, I think to really get ground truth as I go back to separating the retail and the wholesale demand. I'll say it is confusing at the moment. I'm a bit uncertain out there. We walked away from the trade shows where we spend a lot of time with engineering construction customers predominantly European based at the two shows at the Intergeo and Bauma and actually sentiment and engagement in attendance was very high. We look at infrastructure projects, the HS2, the Grand Paris. There is infrastructure work happening in Europe. So, in that sense, I'm positive on continued business in Europe residential I think is turning. Markets like EPC work are, I think will be solid for obvious reasons in Europe, but those do take time. Farm income and farm sentiment, that has a [indiscernible] sort of correlate to harvest and whether as that comes together, it ended up being a harder year for European farmers than I think they thought earlier in the year. As you know, there was \u2013 so that was pretty dry in Europe and then that impacted sentiment. So, we'll see how they [feel] [ph], let's say, coming into the spring planting season. So, there's little \u2013 some winds going, but winds going both ways in Europe at the moment. But hey, despite all of that, I go back to what do we do at Trimble, we sell productivity and sustainability and I think the value proposition of technology is just as important as ever. You're welcome. Good morning, Jason. I think there's some growth in that. Our crossed up bookings and part of the business within B&I that's selling Trimble Construction One, we saw over 20% of our ACV bookings coming from cross-sell. And as we've talked about at Investor Day, we're still very early in the work with TC1, I'm expanding that offering into different geographies and broadening the scope and the automation of the offering. So, I think that there's only tailwinds behind the business model aspect of that. And then if I flip it around, let's say, for the rest of the business. The software side at B&I does have incrementally more American centricity to it, which is the healthiest of the four geographies that we report. So that, I think would also help that as well. Thanks, Jason. Hi, good morning, Gal. So, we do continue to feel that the IIJA versus now, I guess, BIO, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, [indiscernible] that's gone into law. We continue to believe it's a positive catalyst for business. And that 10% organic growth in overall North America at the total company level clearly has a B&I and geospatial aspect to that. So, call that engineering and construction if we up level. Money is starting to flow from the federal government to the states.  When you look again at the state level, some states actually have multiple funding sources for their infrastructure like they're not entirely dependent on the incremental money from the Fed. And that's interesting to us because there are subset of states in the U.S. that are, I'd say, they're at work already and we're seeing good activity from those states.  If I take the majority of the states though, I think one of the things that's on the headwind side of the infrastructure bill is that material cost and labor cost are eating into some of the increased amount of the funding. And there still does seem to be a lag between the funding mechanism and the work actually starting to happen. And so, we feel like there's been a lag and we're not really seeing the fruits of it at, at a \u2013 let's say a level we might have expected at this point. So, now you weren't asking so much about 2022 as looking forward. So, if we go into next year, I think that that does provide us, let's say, a certain level of ballast to the business and our sentiment certainly for the North American side of Trimble engineering and construction. Good morning, Jonathan. Hey, it's Rob. So, there's certainly a number of, let's say, levers directions where we've seen the ARR grow. So, first, I'll take expanding the size of the addressable market and our best example of that is from our SketchUp product within buildings and infrastructure. I think we're going on 13 or 14 quarters in a row of more than 40% ARR growth in that business is really remarkable. So, kudos to the team on that. And you're not doing that through pricing, you're doing that through unit and where those kind of unit growth, that's a clear sign to us of expanding the size of the addressable market. We weren't expanding units at that level prior to the model conversion. We see it in our [indiscernible] business, as well as that we're seeing unit growth, which we think is showing a sign of expanding the size of addressable market. Second, I could put in a category of say, general market uplift or adoption of technology. You can argue that's riding a wave, so to speak, of digitization and the market that provides a certain level of growth in the ARR and the business. The third category I would call the cross-sell, and when we really get to the economics of the connected scale strategy and think about the 1.55 billion of ARR we're sitting on top of, we think that there's a couple hundred million plus of ARR to be mined, just from within the portfolio we have. And so, as I think about economic scenarios if the economy were to take a turn for the worse, you know your classic play is to look what the customers you have and rethink the amount of capital you're putting to new logo generation. So, I'm optimistic that whatever the scenario is that there's a lot to be done from within our own portfolio. And I'll say that fourth and last category is straight up new logo growth. So, the sum of those to me is the sum of parts that gets to the total company level. Well, I'd say congratulations to the folks who are stepping into new roles. 100% believers in them and the work that they've got ahead of them. So, I think that change can be a good thing. Change provides opportunity. Change provides a chance for a fresh look at some things. Sometimes leadership transitions, I'd say, are \u2013 that's the right thing for the business. And as you proactively make them other times, you're reacting because somebody decides to leave the organization. So, there's a little bit of both of those that provide a backdrop in context for the transitions that we have in mind. The tone I'd want to set on the transitions that we have is that it's about executing connect and scale at the strategy level. Our operating system talks about strategy, people and execution. So, the strategy is to connect and scale manifesting through these industry clouds that we're building, bringing the best capabilities we have together. So, our leaders, all of us, myself included every single one of our operators and folks who work to support the operators are working to build the product offering to meet this platform and industry cloud direction that we're going. At a people level, we aim to continue to be the employer of choice and technology and our rankings in that area continue to be world-class.  So, I expect some leaders to lead, to inspire, to engage, to achieve. And then we've got to meet our numbers on the execution and so you know how much weight we put towards the ARR growth in the business. When we talk about our three key metrics, we're talking about ARR, EBITDA, and cash flow. So, we have to not just talk in package, we have to deliver, and we have to deliver in an environment that's got an increasing level of uncertainty around it. So, that's the expectation I have for the leaders who were in their roles and I got a great deal of belief in them to be able to do so. You're welcome. Hi, Chad. Well, hey, Rob, this is the other Rob. In the Ag business overall, actually the majority of our business, I want to frame is outside of North America today. So, strong double-digit growth in Brazil, really in South America, continued growth in Asia Pacific. Overall organically, the business was up in the high-single-digits for agriculture. So, I think North America is holding its own as the punch line on that, but I want to put North America in the context of the bigger picture."

            "name": "David Barnes",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue of $885 million was up 6% organically. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 4%, while divestitures net of acquisitions also reduced revenue by 4%. Pricing drove slightly over half of our year-on-year organic revenue growth. Software and recurring revenue continued to grow at a strong rate as reflected by the sequential acceleration of our organic ARR growth.  Ongoing transitions of software models from perpetual to recurring, principally in our Transportation and Buildings and Infrastructure segments, contributed to our ARR momentum, but reduced revenue growth in the quarter by approximately 100 basis points. Hardware revenues grew modestly on an organic basis, enabled by reduced lead times and improving throughput from our supply chain.  Supply chain constraints continue to be dynamic in nature, but our team made good progress in the quarter working around these constraints and executed well in a challenging and unpredictable environment. Bookings for hardware products from our dealers declined sequentially from prior quarters and came in below our expectations, reflecting a softening demand environment in some of our end markets and lower dealer inventories.  Gross margin in the third quarter was a record 60.9%, up 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by an increasingly favorable business mix and the improving net impact of pricing and slowing input cost inflation. Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins were essentially flat year-over-year, and well above pre-COVID levels. Strong gross margins and lower accruals against our annual incentive plans fully offset the year-on-year impact of spending against our strategic initiatives.  Net income dollars decreased by 3% and earnings per share were flat year-over-year at $0.66 per share. Our trailing 12-month cash flow from operations was $440 million, and free cash flow was $389 million, both of which are down versus prior year. As we outlined in our last earnings call, inventory dynamics and a change in the U.S. tax law are adversely impacting our cash flows in 2022.  Our inventories are well above the levels we held before the supply chain shortages emerged in 2021, as we have been buying to support improved hardware lead times. And a provision in the U.S. tax law has resulted in the amortization of R&D costs for tax purposes beginning in 2022, which has meaningfully impacted the timing of tax payments. We expect both of these unusual factors will reverse in 2023, which will yield significant increases in cash flow and a more normalized relationship between earnings and cash flow going forward.  Note that the underlying working capital dynamics of our business remain strong, with essentially zero net working capital even at our temporarily higher levels of inventory. Notwithstanding a reduction in backlog from improved hardware lead times, we enter the fourth quarter with $1.5 billion in backlog, $1.3 billion of which supports future software, services and recurring revenue.  We ended the quarter with leverage measured as net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.4 times, giving us a resilient capital structure and the flexibility to invest where we see opportunity. This quarter we funded our acquisition of Bid2Win and completed $90 million in share repurchases. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends. On this and the next few pages I will focus on organic growth rates, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and currency fluctuations. ARR was up 16%, with strong bookings in construction and healthy net retention across our portfolio. Our non-recurring revenue streams grew modestly, with hardware up 3% year-over-year. As Rob mentioned earlier, our non-recurring revenues were below our expectations, driven by weaker end market demand in some markets, especially in Europe, and growing caution among our dealers on how much inventory they want to hold. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 10%. In Europe, where the macro-economic outlook contracted the most, revenues were down 3%. Asia-Pacific was up 4%, and the rest of world was up 21%. Next on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. ARR in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities all grew at a mid-teens or above rate, while Transportation ARR growth was high-single digits and improved sequentially. Let's turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of our reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 12%. Revenue growth was strong across our software businesses in this segment, while our Civil Construction hardware revenue benefited from improved supply chain throughput. Segment ARR was up in the [20's] [ph] in the quarter. Geospatial segment revenue was up 1% over a very strong performance in the third quarter of 2021. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 9%, driven by improved throughput from our supply chain, strong demand from OEM customers, and continued growth in our positioning services. Financial results in Transportation showed progression in a number of areas. ARR growth and margins both improved for the fourth quarter in a row. We continue to progress in the conversion of our Transportation Enterprise software business to recurring revenue models. Turning now to Slide 9, I'd like to provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. I'll start with ARR. Driven by our momentum in bookings and sustained high levels of net retention, our outlook for ARR growth is unchanged from what we shared with you last quarter. We continue to expect organic ARR growth of approximately 16%. Turning to revenue, we now project organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the full-year, which is 300 basis points below the outlook we shared with you in August. For the full-year we expect that changes in foreign exchange rates will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by 3%, while divestitures net of acquisitions will also reduce revenue by 3%. We expect operating margins for the full-year of approximately 23%, which is consistent with the range we shared with you in August. Our outlook for gross margins has improved, driven both by an improving business mix and a more positive outlook for pricing and costs. We project that our improving gross margins and strong operating cost control will offset the adverse impact of lower leverage on our fixed costs. Our forecast for income from equity investments is approximately $28 million and net interest costs are estimated to be approximately $66 million. Our tax rate guidance is a range of 18% to 18.5%. Taken in aggregate, we now expect full-year 2022 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $2.61 and $2.67 per share. From a cash flow perspective, we now expect the ratio of free cash flow to non-GAAP net income to be 0.5x to 0.6x for the year, with the primary impacts continuing to be Section 174 tax payments and inventory dynamics. We continue to expect to deliver 2023 free cash flow well above non-GAAP net income as these factors reverse. From a segment perspective, in the fourth quarter we expect organic growth rates to moderate in the Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities segments driven entirely by lower year-on-year revenues from hardware. In the Transportation segment, we expect the growth rate to improve sequentially. ARR growth should remain relatively consistent with recent trends in each of our segments. We expect to issue 2023 guidance in February, but at this point we anticipate a 2023 outlook for double-digit ARR growth and strong cash flow generation. Rob, I'll turn it back over to you. Yes, Jerry, I understand your question. There's no real negative margin impact to the outlook we have. In fact, the embedded in our guidance as you do the math, you'll see we expect to have very high gross margins in Q4 even higher than Q3 and that's a function of a business mix, which will be more software centric and we'll have more of the net benefit of the prices we've taken and moderating cost inflation. So, Q4 will be really good from a gross margin perspective. This is a little bit of, I'll call it [noise] [ph] between Q3 and Q4 with the reduction in our outlook or forecast for the year, we brought down our accrual against our incentive comp. So, just the incentive comp helped Q3 margins by a little under 200 basis points and that gets normalized in Q4. So, that's really the driver of the expectation of lower margins in Q4 than Q3, but the underlying gross margins will be better and the OpEx as a percent of revenue will look higher, but that's the impact of the accounting for the bonus plans. Yes. Hey, Kristen, it's David. We have a model where we're looking at our cash flow with some moderation this year. We're a cash flow generating business. We did some divestitures earlier in the year. And we look to make sure we have the right capital structure for our business and fund our growth plans and we use a matrix when the share price comes down that gives us an opportunity to be a bit more aggressive. Over time, the focus of our capital allocation is on growth and we won't have share repurchase get in the way of giving us firepower to invest in growth. Our leverage at 1.4x is actually below where we think we could be on a long-term basis. And so, we were comfortable bumping it up a little bit based on all those variables. Yes. Hey, Tami, it's David. I'll start by saying, I'm going to be careful not to give 2023 guidance. We will do that in February, but I'll talk about some broad trends that I think are likely to influence our margins going forward. On the gross margin side, we think there's a macro trend here of higher growth in our software businesses and recurring, which has higher gross margins. So that will help us. We think with humility that the world is uncertain, but we're past the peak of input cost inflation on the hardware side. We've taken price, I'll say some of you are comparing us with other industrial companies. We've taken actually less price if you just look as a percentage price increase than some of the big industrial players. And we think that makes sense given our economics and our focus on staying competitive, but we think within hardware, we'll see continued moderation of costs and we'll have pricing that can keep up with that maybe do a little bit better. With that said, we're investing against our strategic priorities that we mentioned in the Investor Day. And so, I think we have some levers to pull on with regard to margin. As Rob mentioned in his commentary, we're looking at the softening demand environment and we're being increasingly careful and prudent in our costs. We are every day, every month looking at our internal resource capital allocation. We've slowed down the rate of our hiring and our cost additions and we will continue to be really prudent understanding that the demand environment next year is going to be hard to predict. So, hopefully that gives you the picture you need. We'll have more to say about this in February. Yes. Hey, Erik, it's David. Margins were particularly good in geospatial and that's mostly a mix issue within the offerings and we think that's a little bit better than we're going to have in Q4. So, it's just a mix of the products that we sell and what we shipped in Q3 was particularly high margin. Sure. Well, in the \u2013 of the four segments, the geospatial does start with the lowest base. So, in terms of percentage increase to be intellectually honest, it's coming off that lower base. And the team deserves credit for the pivoting of the business model. So, when you buy our instruments and sensors like the hardware centric part of geospatial, so think the surveyors and the [Mappers] [ph] out there in the world, they're buying workflow, actually, they're not just buying an instrument and that workflow includes software. So, we have Trimble business and Trimble access. So, these field to finish workflows that the field needs or if you're doing scanning data or mobile mapping, data collection, you need to be able to process that data. So, the software that we have in that business is being converted more into ratable models, which we think is expands the size of the addressable market, turns the CapEx and the OpEx is helping us as a catalyst to move more of the work into to the cloud. So, in that sense, Erik, yes, I think it's a very good example of connect and scale at play. Yes. Hey, Jason. I'll point out that really important when you look at hardware to get the organic math in your mind. And that's both FX and we divested businesses, which were heavily hardware centric. So, actually if you look at the organic numbers, hardware revenues were up 3% year-on-year in Q3. And that does reflect that we were \u2013 our product supply improves a lot and we were able to draw down the backlog and meet the dealer needs where we've had extraordinarily long lead times. So, that having said, embedded within our guidance is that hardware organic revenues are likely to be down in the fourth quarter and it's driven by all the dynamics Rob mentioned. Hey Gal, it's David. So, we've taken more pricing in hardware than software. Software pricing is a little, sort of amorphous because you're always adding more features and how much do you attribute to more functionality versus the price. It's been our practice to increase pricing over time in our software businesses and we've [uped] [ph] that a little bit with the inflationary environment, but more of our price increases have been against our hardware.  And just to put some numbers around it, if you look year-on-year and we've taken several ways of price increases. Across our hardware portfolio, our prices year-on-year are up about 6%. So that's the rate of headline inflation. Good news for us is that the rate of inflation of our cost is actually less than that. So, we're getting some hardware margin benefit from the net impact of [pricing and cost] [ph]. But the pricing on the software is less than [six] [ph], where you can think of that in the low single digits or little less than 5% pricing on our software. Hey Chad, it's David. As you do through the math, go through the math and look at our guidance, you'll see that we expect meaningful improvement in gross margins from Q3 to Q4 and that's driven by a mix, our hardware revenues even organically will be down in the fourth quarter for all the reasons that Rob mentioned. So, the software to hardware mix is going to improve and we have the benefit within hardware, particularly of a favorable mix between pricing and cost. So that gets you to gross margins. OpEx as a percent of revenue will be higher because we had \u2013 we have the bonus impact that I described to an earlier question where we had, call it, no bonus expense in Q3. That's the way the approval works. We also have some step-up in OpEx Q3 to Q4 sequentially. It's the way holiday's work in Europe and we have a big user conference coming up. So, those dynamics will drive our OpEx as a percent of revenue, higher in Q3 and Q4 with lower revenue unit that all out we expect operating margins to be lower in Q4 versus Q3. Yes. We are \u2013 I'll say the guidance, the framework we provided earlier in the year and last quarter still holds we're investing against our digital transformation and a handful of other strategic initiatives at a rate that's about 100 basis points of margin. So, that's what it was in Q3. And that's what it will be in Q4. We're looking harder at OpEx everywhere, but as Rob said, what we're not doing is changing our fundamental priorities and progressing against the digital transformation is absolutely at the top of our strategic list. So, that you can call that pressure is there and we're managing to hold our model within the context of sustaining that investment going forward. Yes. So, I'll start with the numbers. You're about right. Our hardware backlog went from about 240 million at the end of last quarter to 180 million so down 60 million, which is a good thing that reflects the fact that our supply chain is improving. Pre-COVID, pre-supply chain, that number was closer to a hundred. So, we will move in that direction, although I'm not sure we'll ever get back to where it was because supply chains are likely to be different for everybody going forward. As far as dealer dynamics, it's a very dynamic situation. It varies dealer-to-dealer market-to-market. I'd say overall most dealers are about where they have been and probably about where they want to be. As Rob mentioned, the dealers are looking at their markets and are seeing some uncertainty and so their sort of set point for inventory is going down and that's somewhat accelerated by the fact that our supply chain has now gotten so good, not universally, but for most of our products, we have order lead times measured in days, not months. And so, the need to hold a bunch of inventory for the dealer is less than it was. So, it's a mix. There are some dealers that are looking at uncertainty in their markets and will be inclined, particularly with our good supply chain to bring inventories down and some are in very good shape."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Trimble Incorporated Financial Results Conference Call. Please note, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Painter, you may begin your conference.\nRob Painter : Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. I will lead the call today as David is at home on the back end of the COVID quarantine. Jim Todd, our head of FP&A is in the room with me, and the 3 of us will handle the Q&A. My commentary on revenue and ARR growth today will reflect organic performance, thereby excluding our acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency movements. Let's begin on Page 2 with our key messages. Our team delivered a record second quarter, exceeding our own expectations. My congratulations to our team and our global partners. Annualized recurring revenue grew 15% and we now stand at $1.51 billion of ARR. Total revenue was up 6%, also ahead of expectations, as was gross margin of 59.7%, a record level for Trimble. This flowed through to exceeding our expectations on EPS. The Trimble operating system balances strategy, people and execution. We have been busy the last few months, demonstrating progression and proof points on many fronts. On strategy, we are seeing solid progress with our Trimble Construction One offering, which is a bundled offering of our construction software solutions currently targeted towards contractors. We tried to start with this segment of Trimble customers as we have the value proposition and momentum on our side. From this new baseline, we will expand to other personas and construction such as architects and designers and owners, and we will roll out the offering on a more global basis. We will then extend this approach across our other applicable businesses. Our indicators are telling us that with Trimble Construction One, our win rates are going up, our sales cycles are becoming shorter and our average deal size is increasing. We also see progress in cross-selling efforts with more than 20% of our construction software bookings coming from cross-sell in the second quarter, which is increasing our share of wallet and penetration into our installed base. From a capital allocation perspective, we divested 5 businesses in the quarter, where the revenue profile was greater than 90% hardware that was not core to driving connected value in our industry clouds. This included product lines such as own goods, safety best, land scales and rotating lasers. In the quarter, we made the decision to exit the Russian market and we repurchased 200 million of our shares. Our priority remains investing back into our business and pursuing acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline is relatively full at the moment, and we have the firepower to act. On people, we were recently named a top company for leadership and global culture in a survey by Comparably. We also appointed Ron Bisio to oversee our transportation and logistics business. Ron is a 23-year Trimble veteran, and has led the growth and transformation of our survey business over the last few years. Ron is an excellent leader and his mandate is to execute our strategy faster. James Langley will redirect his focus to his biggest area of strength, which is his understanding of the needs of customers in the overall market. On execution, we continue to simplify our portfolio through actions such as reducing the number of part numbers and product offerings. We are building resilience for future products by designing more of our new hardware offerings to have dual sourcing capabilities on key components. With respect to our digital transformation, I am pleased with the cadence of delivery on the process and systems front, which we need in order to increase the velocity and scalability of our Trimble Construction One and cross-selling efforts. Our current technology stack is deployed in France and Benelux as a test market. Our most recent release gives our customers the ability to buy and add multiple products on a single contract, and gives our sellers the ability to sell across the breadth of our portfolio from a single go-to-market team. This release gives us visibility across the entire customer and prospect base, driving a true customer 360 view in 1 system and providing us accurate metrics and KPIs from a single source of truth. From here, we will continue to refine and add functionality and extend the other geographies, including North America, which will happen in the first half of next year. Changing gears, I have met with a few dozen customers, well more than 1,000 Trimble employees and many investors over the last few weeks, including a 3-week visit throughout Europe. Our team believes in our connect-and-scale journey, and I am grateful that they are willing to challenge us to execute better and faster. Our customers are validating our direction. They are asking for help to unlock more digital insights and to integrate data and workflows across multiple products to drive even more value. They have efficiency and sustainability at the top of their agendas, along with access to qualified labor and inflationary pressures to manage in the near term. They are also asking us to be easier to do business with as they want to more broadly access our technology. On the investor front, the topic has been almost singular, that is the macroeconomic environment and recessionary clouds. Broadly speaking, market indicators and demand remain strong on an absolute basis. On a relative basis, it seems that our end markets are catching their breath and coming off a bit of a high point. Inflation is a top concern. In Engineering & Construction, we watch signals such as construction backlog, the Architectural Billing Index, Dodge Momentum Index, as well as signals from our own systems. In Agriculture, we look at equipment sales, commodity prices, inventory levels and farm income. In Transportation, we look towards freight demand, capacity utilization, freight rates and fuel prices. These indicators remain net favorable on an absolute basis. Overall, Trimble is much more secular than cyclical in nature. After all, productivity and efficiency are needed more than ever in challenging markets. To help investors appreciate the resilience of Trimble, let's turn to Page 3, and let the facts speak to the quality of the Trimble business model. Over the last 10 years, we have moved our business from 20% to 55% software services and recurring revenue. That represents over $2 billion today in these differentiated revenue streams that uniquely enable us to connect the physical and digital worlds. Over that same time period, we have moved from $361 million of ARR to $1.51 billion of ARR, a 15% CAGR. We believe this is the most resilient of our revenue streams, and it continues to grow at a healthy double-digit level.  Finally, we have expanded EBITDA margins from 19.9% to 25.6% over this time frame, and we were doing this with an increasingly asset-light business model that operates with negative working capital. The overall point here is simple: if we enter a recession, we have never been better positioned to navigate. Our mindset in this environment, therefore, is to continue to execute our strategy. We are playing the long game, and we will also be prudent with managing our expenses. Our headcount since the beginning of the year has gone up by approximately 2% organically, and we will remain vigilant to allocate our capital and manage our operating expenses in line with our most compelling opportunity sets. Turning now to the quarter and our numbers on Page 4. I'll start by making the point that normal seasonality and year-over-year quarterly comparisons are a bit incomplete as the pandemic and supply chain shortages have altered historical patterns as have our recent divestitures and adverse movements in FX. Second quarter revenue was $941 million, up 6% organically. Revenue in the quarter was aided by strong performance through our supply chain as we were able to reduce hardware backlog and improve lead times across most of our hardware offerings. Gross margin expanded by 150 basis points to 59.7%, driven by a favorable mix shift towards software offerings and the net impact of pricing and cost. The year-on-year rate of product cost inflation eased modestly in the quarter and came in better than our expectations. As supply chain initiatives implemented over the last several quarters have allowed us to reduce our reliance on both expedited transportation and the expensive broker market for scarce parts. We are seeing meaningful improvement overall in the reliability of our supply chain, but significant issues remain, and we don't expect a fully normalized supply chain environment until well into 2023. We faced a number of critical part shortages that reduced our ability to meet customer demand in the second quarter, and those issues will continue to modestly constrain our revenue for the remainder of 2022. EBITDA and operating margins for the quarter were 24.2% and 22.4%, respectively. Operating costs grew versus year ago levels, driven both by the gradual normalization of travel expenses and by the planned investments we are making against our strategic growth initiatives. Net income and EPS were both lower than prior year levels, yet ahead of our expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have generated $470 million of free cash flow, and through the first half of 2022, we generated just over $173 million of free cash flow, both of which are below our long-term goal of generating cash flow in excess of our non-GAAP net income. The main 2 factors impacting second quarter cash flow are the build-up of inventory, driven by supply chain disruptions and tax payments related to the elimination of upfront tax expensing of R&D costs in the U.S. We expect both of these items to normalize over time. Meanwhile, we are operating with negative working capital. Turning to Page 5. The highlight metric is the 15% growth in ARR, which reflects strength in bookings, high net retention and the continued conversion of our perpetual software offerings. Hardware revenue grew at a rate of 3% versus a very strong second quarter of a year ago, while perpetual software revenues were down modestly, driven in part by our ongoing model conversions. Geographically, North America revenue was up 8%. Europe was up 1%. The loss of business in Russia and Ukraine reduced Europe revenue growth by 5 percentage points. Asia Pacific was up 5% and rest of world was up 22%. Looking at the highlighted metrics on Page 6, we have covered many of these already. I'll comment on our backlog, which stands at $1.6 billion of which approximately $240 million is hardware. Hardware backlog came down by approximately $110 million in the quarter, about half from divestitures and half from improving supply chain execution. Before the COVID-induced supply chain disruption, our hardware backlog was typically around $100 million, so we are still a good distance from normal backlog dynamics. We have also returned cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program with 445 million of share repurchases on a trailing 12-month basis. We ended the quarter with net debt just slightly over 1x EBITDA, leaving us with the capital structure, which provides both resilience and ample dry powder to invest against our strategy. Turning now to segment trends on Page 7. We had a very strong quarter in Buildings & Infrastructure with 13% organic revenue growth and over 20% organic ARR growth. We had strong bookings and net retention across our software offerings in this sector. Our Civil Construction business, which has a meaningful hardware component, benefited both from strong demand and improving supply chain execution. In our Geospatial segment, we came into the quarter with an expectation of lower year-on-year organic growth due to the comparison with the unprecedented strength in the second quarter of last year. Organic revenue was down 5% reflecting both tough comps and some acute component shortages. Demand for our survey offerings remains strong, and the combination of growing bookings and supply chain challenges resulted in backlog remaining at an elevated level through the quarter. Resource and Utilities organic revenue grew by 15% in the second quarter, reflecting a significantly improved supply chain situation for most of our agriculture products. Transportation organic revenue was down 5% on a year-over-year basis and was below our expectations, driven primarily by lower hardware sales to North American customers. While the financial results for transportation have remained below our expectations, there were a number of positive developments in the quarter that position our business for improved trends in 2023 and beyond. ARR grew in the quarter at a mid-single-digit rate, representing sequential improvement in the rate of growth. Our churn of mobility customers was lower in the second quarter than in any quarter since late 2018. The performance of our ELD software is now very strong and customer satisfaction has improved significantly. We have announced our new mobility product to the market and are actively engaging with both existing customers and new logos. I'll now turn to our outlook for 2022 on Page 8. We are raising our guidance on ARR growth to 16% for the year as our conviction on the underlying drivers of growth has increased. For the metrics of total revenue and EPS, 3 factors lead us to project a more cautious outlook for the full year: FX, supply chain and demand. This weighs approximately 1/2 FX and 1/2 supply chain and demand. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar over the last 90 days has obviously been significant. Fortunately, our cost base is quite global and creates a natural hedge, leaving us with only a modest residual exposure to foreign exchange on operating margins. While supply chains are demonstrably better, and we hold our previous conviction on gross margin improvement in the second half of the year, it only takes 1 component to prevent a product from shipping, and we are facing some critical component shortages that we believe will impact our geospatial and Resources and Utilities segments. On the demand front, we are seeing modestly lower-than-expected ordering across the transportation and agriculture sectors. Farmer sentiment has moderated in the face of high input cost inflation. Incorporating these factors, we expect revenue in the range of $3.76 billion to $3.82 billion, which reflects an outlook for the full year organic total revenue growth of 9% to 11%. Overall revenue growth and organic revenue growth are expected to improve sequentially from the second quarter through the third and fourth quarters, reflecting increased pricing and increased software and recurring growth. Note that the impact of our divestitures on our revenue will be approximately 5% in both the third and fourth quarters. If foreign exchange rates remain where they are now, we expect a negative impact on revenue of approximately 4% in the third quarter and 3% in the fourth quarter. Gross margins are expected to sustain the improvement we saw in the second quarter into the second half of the year, primarily -- driven primarily by pricing but also by moderating supply chain costs. Our outlook for full year operating margins remains at 23% to 23.5%. The high point for both gross margin and operating margin for the year is expected to be in the fourth quarter. Our revised full year EPS range is $2.70 to $2.80. We expect the ratio of free cash flow to non-GAAP net income to come in around 0.7x for the year, impacted by the aforementioned R&D expensing change under the U.S. tax code and inventory dynamics. It is likely these factors will reverse, and we would expect to deliver free cash flow well above non-GAAP net income in 2023. Conclusion, the financial story for the second quarter was revenue, ARR and gross margin outperformance. For the year, the punchline is seeing through currency movements, divestitures and some choppiness in the macro environment to highlight that we are raising our view on ARR growth to 16% and guiding organic revenue growth between 9% to 11%. In the second half of the year, we expect to build on our second quarter momentum with sequential improvements in organic growth and gross margin through both the third and fourth quarters. Strategically speaking, the resilience of our business is stronger than ever. Our markets are inflecting with the adoption of digital technologies. This is our moment to connect at scale, and we remain committed to this journey. Operator, let's open the line to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc.\nJason Celino: So Rob, the Construction One platform, nice to hear the strong performance. I'm curious, though, where are you seeing the most traction. Is it with current customers potentially looking to upgrade and expand or is it with some of the new net wins that you talked about in your prepared remarks?\nRob Painter: The majority of the growth, I would say, at the moment is coming from the existing customer base. And that's actually pretty logical from our perspective when we've done the work within our own portfolio. We think there's enormous opportunity to cross-sell and upsell within the customer base. So one of the things that the team has done an excellent job of moving existing customers to Trimble Construction One contract offerings such that they've got an on-ramp to consuming more of the technology. At a net new logo perspective, the team is winning net new logos as well. So -- that is -- I think it's showing some early signs of success. But the bulk and the majority is from existing customers at the moment.\nJason Celino: And then I think you mentioned at the beginning that the logic or the premise is to take this type of bundling sweet style approach to some of your other segments.\nRob Painter: Yes, exactly, Jason. So right now, we're working in the -- actually the contractor persona within construction and actually really even within building construction, most specifically, then we'll look towards architects and designers. As a persona, we have a bundled offering with TC1, a suite targeted to them than a suite targeted to owners. Trimble Construction One will also apply to our Civil business, where we can connect what we're doing in the field with office on a singular contract. And then in parallel, but at some level, we'll play out a little bit more serially, as with our transportation business and the agriculture business. So it's absolutely consistent mindset we have across the business as we pursue this platform strategy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: Rob, I had kind of a higher-level question. I mean, there's a lot happening in infrastructure construction may actually get going. There's a bunch of kind of mega projects out there that were in the past. And I wonder if you could just kind of assess the strategic landscape for you and your competitors, whether the collection of offerings that you have and are now protecting scaling, is evolving as fast as your competition? Do you anticipate this to be the next 2 or 3 or 4 years that are highly dynamic on acquisitions to get a range portfolio where they want, or is that not necessarily a moment that needs to see people change radically. Just really if you could just assess how you're evolving versus your competitors in the construction landscape.\nRob Painter: Well let me give you a perspective, more at the mega project level and with some of the largest customers. Because as you know, I mean, there's a segmentation by size of customer. I met this largest customer level I have actually had a chance to meet with a number of them recently and to meet with customers who are working on some of these mega projects, both in the U.S. and throughout Europe. There's no question from my perspective that customers -- these big customers on the big projects are looking to bring the multiple technologies they have together into a common data environment and I think we're uniquely positioned to be able to deliver a common data environment.  We take a view that with as much as we do in construction, engineering and construction, we think we've got the broadest portfolio in the industry. The reality is we don't do everything nor do our competitors or our peers. So our mindset is that of an open system being able to bring data from disparate sources together. And we're informed by that through our own set of technology that we have that can serve the architects through the engineers, through the contractors, through the owners. Customers are putting digitization at the top of their agenda. They're putting sustainability at the top of their agenda. At the moment, inflation is, I'd say, a major concern as is labor availability for these large customers and these large projects. So now if I put that into context of the second part of your question around M&A and where might the markets go over time, well, I would expect construction tech has been a rather active field over the last few years. And with the money going into infrastructure, I would expect to see continued investment into the space. I would suspect all of us -- the bigger companies in the industry will probably be reasonably acquisitive. Then I think you have to put that again in context of the companies that are out there. I think there's a lot of businesses out there that in reality are probably features rather than businesses that are better fit for Trimble of peers of Trimble. There's not a lot of scaled technology companies in this industry. If we look at the combined size of our buildings and infrastructure and really the relevant parts of our Geospatial business, I would submit that we're one of the largest, if not the largest construction technology companies in the world.\nRob Wertheimer: And since you touched on inflation, are you seeing any impact on project pacing or delays or cancellations from that inflation, or is it just something people are evaluating? I guess I'll stop there, Rob.\nRob Painter: I would say we are seeing a few delays and some -- not so much cancellations but more delays. And I'll be U.S.-centric when I say this, because we do see the cost of the raw materials having gone up significantly. So now there is more money that is starting to -- it looks like to flow out of the infrastructure bill. At the moment, a good amount of that is getting chewed up through inflation. And so we've seen the money as it's being has a longer delay or a longer lag to put in place construction than we've seen in the past. And we think it's -- I'd say some of the -- and I take a DOT, Department of Transportation, stepping back a bit and doing some reassessment, more working trying to figure out how to work through it. Now put that inflation into its own context of the value proposition of Trimble, which is better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener, we are getting these project owners to pay attention to the value of technology. So I'm encouraged by that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein.\nChad Dillard: So I wanted to spend a little bit of time on your comments about Trimble Construction One and plan to roll it out into your broader construction portfolio. So how much of that portfolio do you plan to scale within Trimble Construction One? And then can you just talk about the road map? So I mean how many years are you planning to take to get that to scale? And just what sort of investment do you need to make to get there?\nRob Painter: Yes. So I'll give you, I'll say, a part of an answer now, and then I think this will be a good topic for us to have time to go into more detail in our Investor Day in early September. Chad, from a Trimble Construction One perspective, if you ask me -- if you're asking me what -- how much of the portfolio of, I'll say, both of the buildings as an infrastructure segment, I would see it applying to my goal is 100%, okay, maybe in reality, it's something a bit less than that. But in terms of ambition level, I think that's what you want to understand is that we rarely see that almost everything in and the business could apply in this mindset, in this approach to how we go to market. The part that would be back off of saying 100% is, hey, we have some small customers take some architects, for example, that we'll only want to buy our SketchUp product. And they can just buy our SketchUp product. We're not going to make them buy everything in order to use SketchUp. So wherever it can apply to customer sense. Our goal is to do that, both in the building construction side as well as the civil construction side of the business. And then in terms of the rollout, I talked about in the prepared remarks, the rollout to different personas, and we started with the contractor persona and construction.  As we come into, say, the first half of next year, I'd say the end of this year and in the first half of next year, we'll start to see those additional personas roll out. And then the thing that goes along parallel with that work of the -- I'll say the product roll out to persona is the underlying digital systems transformation work that we're that we're doing. And that really is an enabler. These are very much linked. So when we talk about the increases in investments we're making into our digital transformation and that run rate has been -- is over, I'd say, over $20 million incremental a year, that is very much associated with driving Trimble Construction One and with our recurring revenue business across all of Trimble. So we're talking about TC1 as the Construction One, but we will have this approach in transportation and agriculture. To really efficiently and effectively scale the work, we need these underlying systems projects to come along. So I talked about that in the prepared remarks that I think we're making nice progress on the early releases. We've got a second release -- but hey, it's only in France and Benelux right now. We'll get to North America in the first half of next year, and of course, North America is where we have the largest amount of revenue. So there, we expect to really my hope and our plan is that we see acceleration in the business as we can be more efficient and effective and actually delivering Trimble Construction One. So I hope that gives you a little perspective, Chad. How many years? I think we're on a -- we're certainly on a multiyear journey. In fact, I talked about rolling out to different businesses within trial different industries within Trimble. Right now, we're also focused on the direct side of our business. We also have about half of Trimble that transacts through partner channels, they're indirect channels, and will be doing partner enablement on the systems work as well over time.\nChad Dillard: And then just my second question, as we stress test the Trimble model for recessionary scenarios, can you just talk about the ebb and flow of recurring revenues, your software revenues in that sort of environment? And how we should think about that going forward?\nRob Painter: Yes, the best data I can give you on that, Chad, will be on Page 3 of the presentation that went along with the script. And so when I look at that and we were thinking about the call, we thought it would be constructive to look at the percent of software in Trimble compared to 10 years ago, the amount of recurring revenue or ARR that we have compared to 10 years ago, as well as the margin and cash flow expansion over that time frame. We were a company that had $361 million of ARR 10 years ago. We stand this quarter at $1.51 billion in ARR. $1.51 billion in ARR, there's not a lot of companies that have that amount of ARR. That's continued to grow over a longitudinal basis has grown 15%. We grew 15% ARR in the quarter, we took the guide up to 16% for the year on the ARR. We believe it's the most resilient of the revenue streams that we have, which is quite logical compared to, let's say, the hardware businesses, which, let's say, in normal times because right now, we do have a backlog in hardware and normal times look something more like a book and burn business. So there is a cyclical undertone to the secular thesis on the hardware business. But this is a major shift we've had in our business over the last few years. And when we've also done the stress test, looking back, you could go back to 2001, we have looked at the financial crisis in the 2008, 2009 time frame. We looked at commodity crash in the '14, '15 time frame as well as early COVID and we stress tested. We could go back and see how we stress tested on variability in the different end markets, as well as revenue streams. And that all informs the point of view we put forward on that ARR and the software side of the revenue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Rob, I'm wondering if we could just pick up that discussion. So it's interesting because your guidance essentially has you exiting ARR organic growth at about 17%, entering the year at 14%. Can you just talk about what's driving the acceleration? And do you see that acceleration continuing into early '23? I know you folks have a pipeline measurement mechanism that gives you pretty good visibility. I'm wondering if you could just touch on what that pipeline looks like as we exit this year?\nRob Painter: Yes. The drivers of the ARR growth are going to be bookings and net retention is the 2 major I'd say, aspects of the ARR growth. So you're right, Jerry, that yes, by the math, we would see -- expect to see a tick-up at the, let's say, in the fourth -- by the fourth quarter in the ARR growth -- in the growth, excuse me, of ARR. Our net retention is running, I'd say, well over 100% across the Trimble businesses. And then the underlying bookings. Bookings have been, I'd say, solid to quite good in the first half of the year, both if we look at before pricing and after pricing view on that. So I think it's one thing that's probably important to communicate is our growth is not just coming from pricing on a, I'll say, a common unit count. So we are actually driving penetration into the business, really both software and hardware as well when I say that. Okay, so as it relates to coming into 2023 and a view on ARR growth, I would be -- I'd hold off on, I'd say, commenting on a specificity for 2023 view on ARR growth, but what I can say is that we would expect to -- just to your point, Jerry, in terms of the visibility in the pipeline and the math is we see double-digit growth next year in that ARR. And I think that's the best way I could answer it at this point.\nJerry Revich: And then just to shift gears a little bit here. Can you just update us on your plans for subscription transitioning from perpetual license as you folks are moving towards the platforms that you spoke to, Rob, in the prepared remarks? Can you just update us on the size of the businesses that you should be looking for to transitioning to subscription from perpetual license given the platform approach?\nRob Painter: Yes, good question, Jerry. So if we look at a TTM revenue on Trimble at the moment, we've got over $450 million in perpetual licenses at the moment. Now if we then we break that $450 million down, the majority of that is associated with the hardware that we sell. So if you're buying let's say, some of the guidance or some of the GNSS receivers, Increasingly, we sell software unlocks to increase capability within the solution.  And then from a -- I'll call it, a straight-up perpetual software stand-alone set of revenue, that's actually quite, is becoming quite small today. And that, I'd say, is kudos to our teams having gone through a lot of the transitions, most recently in the Tekla Structures business has been one of the ones that's done the conversion over the last 12 months, which is part of what's throttled some of the revenue, top line revenue this year, but also been part of the acceleration of the overall ARR from that team. What I'd also want to say, Jerry, is when we look at the software that is associated with that hardware, it is our intention in, I'd say, the near to midterm to move more of that to a recurring basis because we do think that we can continue to provide value to our customers through this firmware, the software over-the-air updates, what you see in some other industries like automotive, for example. So I'd say watch out for that over time and for us to update as we move further along with that. And then, hey, we've also talked a little bit about on our hardware businesses where we want to move more of those towards a subscription offering as we can provide technology assurance to our customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer.\nKristen Owen: I wanted to actually piggyback on that last question and ask specifically about the recurring rates that you noted in Geospatial. I'm wondering is that coming on top of hardware sales? Can you talk about maybe what attach rates look like? And I'm just thinking about what the total addressable market could be for your recurring revenue streams in Geospatial just given the breadth of the hardware that you have in place.\nRob Painter: So Geospatial is the most hardware-centric of the businesses have. And we -- therefore, it has the least amount of software, least amount of recurring revenue on an absolute dollar level. What the team has done is they have moved more of the -- some more of the software revenue that is in the business to recurring. So I'd say on a percentage basis, the ARR is growing nicely in Geospatial as it's growing off a smaller base and earlier in the transition. So there's a little bit of the percentages. If I'm only looking at that segment, that as a result of that math. That dilutes at the total company level. So it's really the other businesses that are driving the total company ARR dollars forward. But you asked a good question, which is, okay, given the amount of hardware that we have in that business, could that look more software-centric in the future and have more unlocks? And I'd say definitively, yes. One example is we have we call it a soft GNSS product, it's called Trimble Catalyst and it think of it as positioning-as-a-service. It's probably the best way to describe it. And we're seeing some really interesting levels of adoption of this positioning-as-a-service. And some applications that we wouldn't have expected to see before. In some cases, it's some traditional markets like GIS market, where it's taking up. We also have seen, giving you just a couple of examples, I wouldn't say this is across the business. But we've got a customer in the state of Florida where we did a competitive switch, and we move that customer entirely to an as-a-service basis everything, the hardware and the software, everything. Think of it as like a white glove service to that customer. So I do think that there's opportunity for the team to do that. And actually, one of the things that I think is really interesting that the team -- and very good that the team is doing, as we're consolidating the number of, I'll say, software products we have. So we're going from many and to really just a couple. And we're taking a mindset of microservices, architecture mindset. So capabilities such as photogrammetry or image recognition, we take as a micro service that's sold on our Trimble Business Center software platform within Geospatial. And so I think that does make for some interesting upsell and recurring revenue opportunities over time. Now besides the addressable market, I think, Kristen, will be lower than what we have in our other markets just by nature of the -- still of the underlying fundamental solution.\nKristen Owen: So then just thinking about what the business models look like and maybe using Construction One as the first iteration of this, I mean, are you thinking that Construction One ultimately looks like a typical subscription model? Or should we be thinking about this as moving towards something that's more consumption based, like where you could flex up and down based on your needs, just thinking about the different models that you could approach with that platform?\nRob Painter: Yes, it's a terrific question, Kristen. In the short term, it will look more like a typical subscription model. But I will say we have a couple of the businesses that really are more on a consumption basis today. It could be consumption on a seasonal basis, let's say, on a farm cycle basis. It's in our Tekla Structures business. We have customers who will buy for the duration of a project. So that is something closer to consumption.  I think if we were to fast forward, I don't know, I'll pick a number, 10 years. I think what comes after the typical subscription model does start to look like consumption in the -- on a longitudinal basis. And at that point, then you have to ask, are you really -- should you be talking about recurring revenue at that point, or is it total revenue to the metric shift over time. So we'll have a little bit of that consumption. But the vast majority in the next few years will look like a typical subscription model.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: I just wanted to maybe start out with your thoughts around the pricing actions that you're taking. Is there a way you can provide us with a little bit of color in terms of the absolute levels, as well as realization, just given some of the inflationary pressure and FX pressures that your customers are facing?\nRob Painter: Jonathan, so 50/50 is the answer. We think it's 50% price, 50%, I'll say, underlying unit volume. We think that weighted a bit higher on pricing, probably in the first half of the year, and we'll wait a little bit more on the unit volume in the second half of the year. There's some differences in the different businesses, ag, construction and whatnot. But there's a bit of a false precision that you can have here in trying to totally quantify this, but that's the best direction I can give you, is about half and half.\nJonathan Ho: And then just in terms of your comments about being much more secular play than cyclical, can you talk a little bit about some of these conversations that you had with large customers and their prioritization of Trimble over maybe more traditional cyclical acquisitions? And Yes, I guess what are you hearing from customers when it comes to preserving their budget spend with Trimble?\nRob Painter: So one of the things we hear from customers relative to the business model. I mean is when you have the -- when you move from CapEx to OpEx, there are a set of customers that you can reach that you weren't previously reaching. So one of the things we've seen when we transition the model in our SketchUp product, and I'll say a shout-out to that team, they're in 11 quarters in a row of over 45% year-over-year ARR growth. far exceeding what I thought was possible. They've done a terrific job. And our Tekla Structures business, that's moved to subscription. We're seeing that we're getting customers that we weren't before. So it is, I'd say, increasing the size of the addressable market. That's a very attractive thing. Okay, so at the largest companies, that's not -- we were already working with many of these companies. What they -- one of the things they like about is the ability to attach the cost of the technology to the specific jobs. So the billing out of technology. So there are some customers who are attracted to that for that reason. Some customers like the ability if they can flex licenses up or down depending on -- because we're moving more and more to named user licenses. If they can flex up or down, that provides value to our customers, and that will be something that -- and that is something that's on the top of their mind. One of the things in addition we see is we move Trimble Construction One. let's say let's talk about the frame agreement part of this is our customers of these big customers, and I met with in Europe were looking to have just one set of terms and conditions and one contract, one frame agreement for them to be able to buy Trimble. And we see some customers, not all, but some customers of the big customers looking to essentially act more like one company and really challenge some of the old paradigms of where technology decisions are made on the individual projects versus trying to drive, I'll say, more corporate efficiency and effectiveness. And so as we move -- for them, as we move the subscription offering, it makes it easier for them to consume a larger amount of Trimble technology. So I felt quite validated with the customers I've met with over the last weeks that this is very much the direction they want us to go.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JP Morgan.\nTami Zakaria: So I wanted to understand your organic growth guide a little better. I think you lowered your guide by about 1% which seems relatively modest when contrasting that to your comment about moderation in several end markets. So can you help us bridge the 2? Is it that your backlog is supporting your growth outlook this year, but you're seeing new order growth that is expected to be delivered after this fiscal, you're seeing more of a sizable slowdown?\nRob Painter: I'll start, and David, if I leave something out, you can jump in on this. A couple of dynamics on that inflection. If I look back to 3 months ago, we had come out of the first quarter, well, quite strong out of the first quarter. And if I take a market like European -- agriculture in Europe that had done quite well at the beginning of the year, that was the same time that we made the decision to exit Russia business. The Ukraine business is effectively shut down at the moment given the war. Between the 2, that's $65 million of revenue. It was my belief that at the 3 months ago that the market was so strong that it could absorb that $65 million, and I was looking at the backlog. I'd say, 3 months later, I was a little too optimistic on that. And if I look at the ag business for the second -- well, actually up level to the segment, the Resources and Utilities segment, we still expect double-digit organic growth in the second half of the year. And I really don't want that point to be lost through my commentary. So we're maintaining a view of double-digit organic growth in agriculture. And to me, the delta from the commentary a few months ago was -- one of the deltas is that I see less ability for that Russia business to just get absorbed into the system. And which I should also say, the majority of our Russia and Ukraine business was agriculture, a strong majority of it. Now connect to the other part of your question on the backlog, we still are running backlog that's, I'd say, a good $140 million ahead of where we would typically see backlog if we're looking back on a longitudinal basis. I think we'll end the year with a higher level of backlog than we expected 3 months ago, different by some of the different businesses in Trimble, and that connects to the commentary around supply chain. David, did I leave anything out?\nDavid Barnes: No, I\u2019ll just sort of what you said in numbers, Rob, that if you look at the midpoint of the revenue guide down $50 million, half of that\u2019s currency, as Rob said. The rest is the mix of demand and supply. There\u2019s actually in a context of an improving supply chain overall. There are some new component supply issues that we actually didn\u2019t anticipate a quarter ago that will pinch our resource business and Geospatial. So as Rob said, that will -- that demand is not expiring. We\u2019re just going to end up for those products with a little more backlog than we expected. And then there\u2019s some residual demand. The ag business in Europe has been really tough. So all the reasons Rob mentioned. There\u2019s not only high inflation, but they\u2019ve had epic heat with lack of productivity. There are issues with constrained availability of fuel. So the sentiment in the ag business globally is definitely less was a quarter ago, and we see it more in Europe. But the demand part of the guide adjustment is quite small.\nTami Zakaria: And quickly, can you remind us your exposure to the residential market across the 4 segments, and whether you\u2019re seeing any slowdown in the revenue end markets?\nRob Painter: Okay, transportation, no exposure; agriculture -- resources and utilities excuse me, no exposure. In the geospatial and the B&I businesses are kind of up-level those, engineering and construction. I said, yes, we do have exposure to residential. It\u2019s not kind of an existential exposure. And what I\u2019d want to say is while residential inflected, let\u2019s say, negative or worse over the last couple of months on an absolute basis, it\u2019s still a very high number. And so we haven\u2019t seen any meaningful inflections down in our business -- in our business, from residential at this point. We haven\u2019t. And I\u2019ll give you an example in the civil construction business. Over the last number of years, we moved towards putting more and more of the technology on excavators, it\u2019s the largest machine count in the world, the lowest level of penetration. That has translated over the last couple of years into more work being done on the bigger residential developments. Just on 1 single-family house, okay, you\u2019re not going to -- I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to use -- my guess is you're going to --not many people are using the technology yet, but you take the larger developments, and they are starting to use technology for site preparation. In the vertical construction side of our business, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a minor level of exposure that we have. I mean the geospatial business, a survey or most surveyors do multiple types of work. So there -- I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s many that only do 1 type of work like they only do residential. I\u2019m not aware of surveyors who would, or at least many surveyors who would only do that. An anecdote, I was talking to one of our dealer partners in Florida, he told me that they were seeing residential go down in Florida. But at the same time, the entertainment business, the theme park work, was going way up and completely offsetting what they were seeing as a down on residential. So the work does move around. We clearly need to pay attention to it, both in Europe, as well as here in the States and then pay attention regionally as well as we\u2019ve seen the movements on residential work. But our contractors are busy. They\u2019ve got the backlog, they\u2019re working through it. So to me, it\u2019s going to be a question of what happens to the size of the backlog in these different end markets that are served. We obviously -- you know we think about residential. We think more about infrastructure, we think about commercial work, we think about segments such as EPC and follow the trends in all of these.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Lapinski with Morgan Stanley.\nErik Lapinski: Congrats on the quarter. Maybe if I could ask you a question just on the transportation business since. We didn't touch too much on that. It looks like the performance for the subscription businesses is definitely improving, but you did not reduce hardware sales in North America. I guess I was just wondering, is that related to any mix within the portfolio of just where you're seeing traction with solutions or improvement? And then you have talked about selling some of that hardware as part of a bundle in the past. Just wondering if that has any factor too.\nRob Painter: So the hardware sales yes, this is hardware primarily it's associated with essentially telematics subscription. We call it our mobility business. So you buy an onboard computer that's enabling technology for the I'll call it the long tail subscription, and we sell on a per truck basis. We felt -- we have an OEM business as well as an aftermarket business. We are primarily an aftermarket business. One of the inflections down we saw in the hardware business was one of our OEM partners taking less volume in the quarter than we anticipated. And that's been fluctuating up and down because as we know, both ourselves, but in this case, an OEM partner, they've got their own supply chain fluctuations independent of Trimble. So that was one inflection on the hardware for the quarter. And then in the aftermarket, I'd say that was lower than we had anticipated as well.  We have launched an updated I'd say, offering. I talked about it in the prepared remarks. And we've got our biggest user conference in about 1.5 weeks that starts, which is our, I'd say, our best venue to roll out what we're doing in that business. So I'd say we're maybe a couple of months -- a few months behind where I thought we might be at this point and driving new business. But we are seeing the pipeline pick up around it. And then you noted the important point, which to me is the thing I didn't want to be lost in the commentary is that of ARR and the sequential growth in the ARR, and it's -- growth in ARR and sequential growth and if you look at the growth from the first quarter and then the growth into the second quarter on the ARR, that to me is the most attractive revenue stream. Well, it's the most attractive revenue stream we have in Trimble. It's the most attractive stream therefore within Transportation. And like that's where we've got to keep our eye on as continuing to drive that ARR forward in the business. So eyes are very much on that, both at the discrete product selling level, in this case, let's say, a telematics subscription, but also form of that Trimble Construction One for our transportation customers for them to be able to buy multiple solutions. So even in absence of having a frame around it, I'd say, it's well positioned as Trimble Construction One is at the moment. It's not like you have to wait to go and sell, \u201cthe house and transportation.\u201d So we've got customers today who will buy our enterprise ERP solutions plus our mobility solutions plus video plus our final mile solutions plus our mapping solutions plus our maintenance solutions. So we have customers who are buying all of that today from us. And like our other businesses, we think that there's an attractive opportunity to upsell and cross-sell within the base.  We'll talk a little bit more about it at Investor Day, but more than 90% of the top 200 trucking companies in North America are Trimble customers, today Trimble Transportation customers, and the majority of those -- very, very strong majority of those are not buying everything they could be buying from us. So we need to continue to work at the go-to-market and product level to get the, I'll say, deliver the most customer value so that we can increase the level of penetration into that market segment.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call over to the speakers for any closing remarks.\nRob Painter : Thank you all. Thank you for attending the call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: Trimble will be having an Investor Day on September 7, and hope you can make it. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. I will lead the call today as David is at home on the back end of the COVID quarantine. Jim Todd, our head of FP&A is in the room with me, and the 3 of us will handle the Q&A. My commentary on revenue and ARR growth today will reflect organic performance, thereby excluding our acquisitions and divestitures and foreign currency movements. Let's begin on Page 2 with our key messages. Our team delivered a record second quarter, exceeding our own expectations. My congratulations to our team and our global partners. Annualized recurring revenue grew 15% and we now stand at $1.51 billion of ARR. Total revenue was up 6%, also ahead of expectations, as was gross margin of 59.7%, a record level for Trimble. This flowed through to exceeding our expectations on EPS. The Trimble operating system balances strategy, people and execution. We have been busy the last few months, demonstrating progression and proof points on many fronts. On strategy, we are seeing solid progress with our Trimble Construction One offering, which is a bundled offering of our construction software solutions currently targeted towards contractors. We tried to start with this segment of Trimble customers as we have the value proposition and momentum on our side. From this new baseline, we will expand to other personas and construction such as architects and designers and owners, and we will roll out the offering on a more global basis. We will then extend this approach across our other applicable businesses. Our indicators are telling us that with Trimble Construction One, our win rates are going up, our sales cycles are becoming shorter and our average deal size is increasing. We also see progress in cross-selling efforts with more than 20% of our construction software bookings coming from cross-sell in the second quarter, which is increasing our share of wallet and penetration into our installed base. From a capital allocation perspective, we divested 5 businesses in the quarter, where the revenue profile was greater than 90% hardware that was not core to driving connected value in our industry clouds. This included product lines such as own goods, safety best, land scales and rotating lasers. In the quarter, we made the decision to exit the Russian market and we repurchased 200 million of our shares. Our priority remains investing back into our business and pursuing acquisitions. Our acquisition pipeline is relatively full at the moment, and we have the firepower to act. On people, we were recently named a top company for leadership and global culture in a survey by Comparably. We also appointed Ron Bisio to oversee our transportation and logistics business. Ron is a 23-year Trimble veteran, and has led the growth and transformation of our survey business over the last few years. Ron is an excellent leader and his mandate is to execute our strategy faster. James Langley will redirect his focus to his biggest area of strength, which is his understanding of the needs of customers in the overall market. On execution, we continue to simplify our portfolio through actions such as reducing the number of part numbers and product offerings. We are building resilience for future products by designing more of our new hardware offerings to have dual sourcing capabilities on key components. With respect to our digital transformation, I am pleased with the cadence of delivery on the process and systems front, which we need in order to increase the velocity and scalability of our Trimble Construction One and cross-selling efforts. Our current technology stack is deployed in France and Benelux as a test market. Our most recent release gives our customers the ability to buy and add multiple products on a single contract, and gives our sellers the ability to sell across the breadth of our portfolio from a single go-to-market team. This release gives us visibility across the entire customer and prospect base, driving a true customer 360 view in 1 system and providing us accurate metrics and KPIs from a single source of truth. From here, we will continue to refine and add functionality and extend the other geographies, including North America, which will happen in the first half of next year. Changing gears, I have met with a few dozen customers, well more than 1,000 Trimble employees and many investors over the last few weeks, including a 3-week visit throughout Europe. Our team believes in our connect-and-scale journey, and I am grateful that they are willing to challenge us to execute better and faster. Our customers are validating our direction. They are asking for help to unlock more digital insights and to integrate data and workflows across multiple products to drive even more value. They have efficiency and sustainability at the top of their agendas, along with access to qualified labor and inflationary pressures to manage in the near term. They are also asking us to be easier to do business with as they want to more broadly access our technology. On the investor front, the topic has been almost singular, that is the macroeconomic environment and recessionary clouds. Broadly speaking, market indicators and demand remain strong on an absolute basis. On a relative basis, it seems that our end markets are catching their breath and coming off a bit of a high point. Inflation is a top concern. In Engineering & Construction, we watch signals such as construction backlog, the Architectural Billing Index, Dodge Momentum Index, as well as signals from our own systems. In Agriculture, we look at equipment sales, commodity prices, inventory levels and farm income. In Transportation, we look towards freight demand, capacity utilization, freight rates and fuel prices. These indicators remain net favorable on an absolute basis. Overall, Trimble is much more secular than cyclical in nature. After all, productivity and efficiency are needed more than ever in challenging markets. To help investors appreciate the resilience of Trimble, let's turn to Page 3, and let the facts speak to the quality of the Trimble business model. Over the last 10 years, we have moved our business from 20% to 55% software services and recurring revenue. That represents over $2 billion today in these differentiated revenue streams that uniquely enable us to connect the physical and digital worlds. Over that same time period, we have moved from $361 million of ARR to $1.51 billion of ARR, a 15% CAGR. We believe this is the most resilient of our revenue streams, and it continues to grow at a healthy double-digit level.  Finally, we have expanded EBITDA margins from 19.9% to 25.6% over this time frame, and we were doing this with an increasingly asset-light business model that operates with negative working capital. The overall point here is simple: if we enter a recession, we have never been better positioned to navigate. Our mindset in this environment, therefore, is to continue to execute our strategy. We are playing the long game, and we will also be prudent with managing our expenses. Our headcount since the beginning of the year has gone up by approximately 2% organically, and we will remain vigilant to allocate our capital and manage our operating expenses in line with our most compelling opportunity sets. Turning now to the quarter and our numbers on Page 4. I'll start by making the point that normal seasonality and year-over-year quarterly comparisons are a bit incomplete as the pandemic and supply chain shortages have altered historical patterns as have our recent divestitures and adverse movements in FX. Second quarter revenue was $941 million, up 6% organically. Revenue in the quarter was aided by strong performance through our supply chain as we were able to reduce hardware backlog and improve lead times across most of our hardware offerings. Gross margin expanded by 150 basis points to 59.7%, driven by a favorable mix shift towards software offerings and the net impact of pricing and cost. The year-on-year rate of product cost inflation eased modestly in the quarter and came in better than our expectations. As supply chain initiatives implemented over the last several quarters have allowed us to reduce our reliance on both expedited transportation and the expensive broker market for scarce parts. We are seeing meaningful improvement overall in the reliability of our supply chain, but significant issues remain, and we don't expect a fully normalized supply chain environment until well into 2023. We faced a number of critical part shortages that reduced our ability to meet customer demand in the second quarter, and those issues will continue to modestly constrain our revenue for the remainder of 2022. EBITDA and operating margins for the quarter were 24.2% and 22.4%, respectively. Operating costs grew versus year ago levels, driven both by the gradual normalization of travel expenses and by the planned investments we are making against our strategic growth initiatives. Net income and EPS were both lower than prior year levels, yet ahead of our expectations. Over the last 12 months, we have generated $470 million of free cash flow, and through the first half of 2022, we generated just over $173 million of free cash flow, both of which are below our long-term goal of generating cash flow in excess of our non-GAAP net income. The main 2 factors impacting second quarter cash flow are the build-up of inventory, driven by supply chain disruptions and tax payments related to the elimination of upfront tax expensing of R&D costs in the U.S. We expect both of these items to normalize over time. Meanwhile, we are operating with negative working capital. Turning to Page 5. The highlight metric is the 15% growth in ARR, which reflects strength in bookings, high net retention and the continued conversion of our perpetual software offerings. Hardware revenue grew at a rate of 3% versus a very strong second quarter of a year ago, while perpetual software revenues were down modestly, driven in part by our ongoing model conversions. Geographically, North America revenue was up 8%. Europe was up 1%. The loss of business in Russia and Ukraine reduced Europe revenue growth by 5 percentage points. Asia Pacific was up 5% and rest of world was up 22%. Looking at the highlighted metrics on Page 6, we have covered many of these already. I'll comment on our backlog, which stands at $1.6 billion of which approximately $240 million is hardware. Hardware backlog came down by approximately $110 million in the quarter, about half from divestitures and half from improving supply chain execution. Before the COVID-induced supply chain disruption, our hardware backlog was typically around $100 million, so we are still a good distance from normal backlog dynamics. We have also returned cash to shareholders through our share repurchase program with 445 million of share repurchases on a trailing 12-month basis. We ended the quarter with net debt just slightly over 1x EBITDA, leaving us with the capital structure, which provides both resilience and ample dry powder to invest against our strategy. Turning now to segment trends on Page 7. We had a very strong quarter in Buildings & Infrastructure with 13% organic revenue growth and over 20% organic ARR growth. We had strong bookings and net retention across our software offerings in this sector. Our Civil Construction business, which has a meaningful hardware component, benefited both from strong demand and improving supply chain execution. In our Geospatial segment, we came into the quarter with an expectation of lower year-on-year organic growth due to the comparison with the unprecedented strength in the second quarter of last year. Organic revenue was down 5% reflecting both tough comps and some acute component shortages. Demand for our survey offerings remains strong, and the combination of growing bookings and supply chain challenges resulted in backlog remaining at an elevated level through the quarter. Resource and Utilities organic revenue grew by 15% in the second quarter, reflecting a significantly improved supply chain situation for most of our agriculture products. Transportation organic revenue was down 5% on a year-over-year basis and was below our expectations, driven primarily by lower hardware sales to North American customers. While the financial results for transportation have remained below our expectations, there were a number of positive developments in the quarter that position our business for improved trends in 2023 and beyond. ARR grew in the quarter at a mid-single-digit rate, representing sequential improvement in the rate of growth. Our churn of mobility customers was lower in the second quarter than in any quarter since late 2018. The performance of our ELD software is now very strong and customer satisfaction has improved significantly. We have announced our new mobility product to the market and are actively engaging with both existing customers and new logos. I'll now turn to our outlook for 2022 on Page 8. We are raising our guidance on ARR growth to 16% for the year as our conviction on the underlying drivers of growth has increased. For the metrics of total revenue and EPS, 3 factors lead us to project a more cautious outlook for the full year: FX, supply chain and demand. This weighs approximately 1/2 FX and 1/2 supply chain and demand. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar over the last 90 days has obviously been significant. Fortunately, our cost base is quite global and creates a natural hedge, leaving us with only a modest residual exposure to foreign exchange on operating margins. While supply chains are demonstrably better, and we hold our previous conviction on gross margin improvement in the second half of the year, it only takes 1 component to prevent a product from shipping, and we are facing some critical component shortages that we believe will impact our geospatial and Resources and Utilities segments. On the demand front, we are seeing modestly lower-than-expected ordering across the transportation and agriculture sectors. Farmer sentiment has moderated in the face of high input cost inflation. Incorporating these factors, we expect revenue in the range of $3.76 billion to $3.82 billion, which reflects an outlook for the full year organic total revenue growth of 9% to 11%. Overall revenue growth and organic revenue growth are expected to improve sequentially from the second quarter through the third and fourth quarters, reflecting increased pricing and increased software and recurring growth. Note that the impact of our divestitures on our revenue will be approximately 5% in both the third and fourth quarters. If foreign exchange rates remain where they are now, we expect a negative impact on revenue of approximately 4% in the third quarter and 3% in the fourth quarter. Gross margins are expected to sustain the improvement we saw in the second quarter into the second half of the year, primarily -- driven primarily by pricing but also by moderating supply chain costs. Our outlook for full year operating margins remains at 23% to 23.5%. The high point for both gross margin and operating margin for the year is expected to be in the fourth quarter. Our revised full year EPS range is $2.70 to $2.80. We expect the ratio of free cash flow to non-GAAP net income to come in around 0.7x for the year, impacted by the aforementioned R&D expensing change under the U.S. tax code and inventory dynamics. It is likely these factors will reverse, and we would expect to deliver free cash flow well above non-GAAP net income in 2023. Conclusion, the financial story for the second quarter was revenue, ARR and gross margin outperformance. For the year, the punchline is seeing through currency movements, divestitures and some choppiness in the macro environment to highlight that we are raising our view on ARR growth to 16% and guiding organic revenue growth between 9% to 11%. In the second half of the year, we expect to build on our second quarter momentum with sequential improvements in organic growth and gross margin through both the third and fourth quarters. Strategically speaking, the resilience of our business is stronger than ever. Our markets are inflecting with the adoption of digital technologies. This is our moment to connect at scale, and we remain committed to this journey. Operator, let's open the line to questions. The majority of the growth, I would say, at the moment is coming from the existing customer base. And that's actually pretty logical from our perspective when we've done the work within our own portfolio. We think there's enormous opportunity to cross-sell and upsell within the customer base. So one of the things that the team has done an excellent job of moving existing customers to Trimble Construction One contract offerings such that they've got an on-ramp to consuming more of the technology. At a net new logo perspective, the team is winning net new logos as well. So -- that is -- I think it's showing some early signs of success. But the bulk and the majority is from existing customers at the moment. Yes, exactly, Jason. So right now, we're working in the -- actually the contractor persona within construction and actually really even within building construction, most specifically, then we'll look towards architects and designers. As a persona, we have a bundled offering with TC1, a suite targeted to them than a suite targeted to owners. Trimble Construction One will also apply to our Civil business, where we can connect what we're doing in the field with office on a singular contract. And then in parallel, but at some level, we'll play out a little bit more serially, as with our transportation business and the agriculture business. So it's absolutely consistent mindset we have across the business as we pursue this platform strategy. Well let me give you a perspective, more at the mega project level and with some of the largest customers. Because as you know, I mean, there's a segmentation by size of customer. I met this largest customer level I have actually had a chance to meet with a number of them recently and to meet with customers who are working on some of these mega projects, both in the U.S. and throughout Europe. There's no question from my perspective that customers -- these big customers on the big projects are looking to bring the multiple technologies they have together into a common data environment and I think we're uniquely positioned to be able to deliver a common data environment.  We take a view that with as much as we do in construction, engineering and construction, we think we've got the broadest portfolio in the industry. The reality is we don't do everything nor do our competitors or our peers. So our mindset is that of an open system being able to bring data from disparate sources together. And we're informed by that through our own set of technology that we have that can serve the architects through the engineers, through the contractors, through the owners. Customers are putting digitization at the top of their agenda. They're putting sustainability at the top of their agenda. At the moment, inflation is, I'd say, a major concern as is labor availability for these large customers and these large projects. So now if I put that into context of the second part of your question around M&A and where might the markets go over time, well, I would expect construction tech has been a rather active field over the last few years. And with the money going into infrastructure, I would expect to see continued investment into the space. I would suspect all of us -- the bigger companies in the industry will probably be reasonably acquisitive. Then I think you have to put that again in context of the companies that are out there. I think there's a lot of businesses out there that in reality are probably features rather than businesses that are better fit for Trimble of peers of Trimble. There's not a lot of scaled technology companies in this industry. If we look at the combined size of our buildings and infrastructure and really the relevant parts of our Geospatial business, I would submit that we're one of the largest, if not the largest construction technology companies in the world. I would say we are seeing a few delays and some -- not so much cancellations but more delays. And I'll be U.S.-centric when I say this, because we do see the cost of the raw materials having gone up significantly. So now there is more money that is starting to -- it looks like to flow out of the infrastructure bill. At the moment, a good amount of that is getting chewed up through inflation. And so we've seen the money as it's being has a longer delay or a longer lag to put in place construction than we've seen in the past. And we think it's -- I'd say some of the -- and I take a DOT, Department of Transportation, stepping back a bit and doing some reassessment, more working trying to figure out how to work through it. Now put that inflation into its own context of the value proposition of Trimble, which is better, faster, safer, cheaper, greener, we are getting these project owners to pay attention to the value of technology. So I'm encouraged by that. Yes. So I'll give you, I'll say, a part of an answer now, and then I think this will be a good topic for us to have time to go into more detail in our Investor Day in early September. Chad, from a Trimble Construction One perspective, if you ask me -- if you're asking me what -- how much of the portfolio of, I'll say, both of the buildings as an infrastructure segment, I would see it applying to my goal is 100%, okay, maybe in reality, it's something a bit less than that. But in terms of ambition level, I think that's what you want to understand is that we rarely see that almost everything in and the business could apply in this mindset, in this approach to how we go to market. The part that would be back off of saying 100% is, hey, we have some small customers take some architects, for example, that we'll only want to buy our SketchUp product. And they can just buy our SketchUp product. We're not going to make them buy everything in order to use SketchUp. So wherever it can apply to customer sense. Our goal is to do that, both in the building construction side as well as the civil construction side of the business. And then in terms of the rollout, I talked about in the prepared remarks, the rollout to different personas, and we started with the contractor persona and construction.  As we come into, say, the first half of next year, I'd say the end of this year and in the first half of next year, we'll start to see those additional personas roll out. And then the thing that goes along parallel with that work of the -- I'll say the product roll out to persona is the underlying digital systems transformation work that we're that we're doing. And that really is an enabler. These are very much linked. So when we talk about the increases in investments we're making into our digital transformation and that run rate has been -- is over, I'd say, over $20 million incremental a year, that is very much associated with driving Trimble Construction One and with our recurring revenue business across all of Trimble. So we're talking about TC1 as the Construction One, but we will have this approach in transportation and agriculture. To really efficiently and effectively scale the work, we need these underlying systems projects to come along. So I talked about that in the prepared remarks that I think we're making nice progress on the early releases. We've got a second release -- but hey, it's only in France and Benelux right now. We'll get to North America in the first half of next year, and of course, North America is where we have the largest amount of revenue. So there, we expect to really my hope and our plan is that we see acceleration in the business as we can be more efficient and effective and actually delivering Trimble Construction One. So I hope that gives you a little perspective, Chad. How many years? I think we're on a -- we're certainly on a multiyear journey. In fact, I talked about rolling out to different businesses within trial different industries within Trimble. Right now, we're also focused on the direct side of our business. We also have about half of Trimble that transacts through partner channels, they're indirect channels, and will be doing partner enablement on the systems work as well over time. Yes, the best data I can give you on that, Chad, will be on Page 3 of the presentation that went along with the script. And so when I look at that and we were thinking about the call, we thought it would be constructive to look at the percent of software in Trimble compared to 10 years ago, the amount of recurring revenue or ARR that we have compared to 10 years ago, as well as the margin and cash flow expansion over that time frame. We were a company that had $361 million of ARR 10 years ago. We stand this quarter at $1.51 billion in ARR. $1.51 billion in ARR, there's not a lot of companies that have that amount of ARR. That's continued to grow over a longitudinal basis has grown 15%. We grew 15% ARR in the quarter, we took the guide up to 16% for the year on the ARR. We believe it's the most resilient of the revenue streams that we have, which is quite logical compared to, let's say, the hardware businesses, which, let's say, in normal times because right now, we do have a backlog in hardware and normal times look something more like a book and burn business. So there is a cyclical undertone to the secular thesis on the hardware business. But this is a major shift we've had in our business over the last few years. And when we've also done the stress test, looking back, you could go back to 2001, we have looked at the financial crisis in the 2008, 2009 time frame. We looked at commodity crash in the '14, '15 time frame as well as early COVID and we stress tested. We could go back and see how we stress tested on variability in the different end markets, as well as revenue streams. And that all informs the point of view we put forward on that ARR and the software side of the revenue. Yes. The drivers of the ARR growth are going to be bookings and net retention is the 2 major I'd say, aspects of the ARR growth. So you're right, Jerry, that yes, by the math, we would see -- expect to see a tick-up at the, let's say, in the fourth -- by the fourth quarter in the ARR growth -- in the growth, excuse me, of ARR. Our net retention is running, I'd say, well over 100% across the Trimble businesses. And then the underlying bookings. Bookings have been, I'd say, solid to quite good in the first half of the year, both if we look at before pricing and after pricing view on that. So I think it's one thing that's probably important to communicate is our growth is not just coming from pricing on a, I'll say, a common unit count. So we are actually driving penetration into the business, really both software and hardware as well when I say that. Okay, so as it relates to coming into 2023 and a view on ARR growth, I would be -- I'd hold off on, I'd say, commenting on a specificity for 2023 view on ARR growth, but what I can say is that we would expect to -- just to your point, Jerry, in terms of the visibility in the pipeline and the math is we see double-digit growth next year in that ARR. And I think that's the best way I could answer it at this point. Yes, good question, Jerry. So if we look at a TTM revenue on Trimble at the moment, we've got over $450 million in perpetual licenses at the moment. Now if we then we break that $450 million down, the majority of that is associated with the hardware that we sell. So if you're buying let's say, some of the guidance or some of the GNSS receivers, Increasingly, we sell software unlocks to increase capability within the solution.  And then from a -- I'll call it, a straight-up perpetual software stand-alone set of revenue, that's actually quite, is becoming quite small today. And that, I'd say, is kudos to our teams having gone through a lot of the transitions, most recently in the Tekla Structures business has been one of the ones that's done the conversion over the last 12 months, which is part of what's throttled some of the revenue, top line revenue this year, but also been part of the acceleration of the overall ARR from that team. What I'd also want to say, Jerry, is when we look at the software that is associated with that hardware, it is our intention in, I'd say, the near to midterm to move more of that to a recurring basis because we do think that we can continue to provide value to our customers through this firmware, the software over-the-air updates, what you see in some other industries like automotive, for example. So I'd say watch out for that over time and for us to update as we move further along with that. And then, hey, we've also talked a little bit about on our hardware businesses where we want to move more of those towards a subscription offering as we can provide technology assurance to our customers. So Geospatial is the most hardware-centric of the businesses have. And we -- therefore, it has the least amount of software, least amount of recurring revenue on an absolute dollar level. What the team has done is they have moved more of the -- some more of the software revenue that is in the business to recurring. So I'd say on a percentage basis, the ARR is growing nicely in Geospatial as it's growing off a smaller base and earlier in the transition. So there's a little bit of the percentages. If I'm only looking at that segment, that as a result of that math. That dilutes at the total company level. So it's really the other businesses that are driving the total company ARR dollars forward. But you asked a good question, which is, okay, given the amount of hardware that we have in that business, could that look more software-centric in the future and have more unlocks? And I'd say definitively, yes. One example is we have we call it a soft GNSS product, it's called Trimble Catalyst and it think of it as positioning-as-a-service. It's probably the best way to describe it. And we're seeing some really interesting levels of adoption of this positioning-as-a-service. And some applications that we wouldn't have expected to see before. In some cases, it's some traditional markets like GIS market, where it's taking up. We also have seen, giving you just a couple of examples, I wouldn't say this is across the business. But we've got a customer in the state of Florida where we did a competitive switch, and we move that customer entirely to an as-a-service basis everything, the hardware and the software, everything. Think of it as like a white glove service to that customer. So I do think that there's opportunity for the team to do that. And actually, one of the things that I think is really interesting that the team -- and very good that the team is doing, as we're consolidating the number of, I'll say, software products we have. So we're going from many and to really just a couple. And we're taking a mindset of microservices, architecture mindset. So capabilities such as photogrammetry or image recognition, we take as a micro service that's sold on our Trimble Business Center software platform within Geospatial. And so I think that does make for some interesting upsell and recurring revenue opportunities over time. Now besides the addressable market, I think, Kristen, will be lower than what we have in our other markets just by nature of the -- still of the underlying fundamental solution. Yes, it's a terrific question, Kristen. In the short term, it will look more like a typical subscription model. But I will say we have a couple of the businesses that really are more on a consumption basis today. It could be consumption on a seasonal basis, let's say, on a farm cycle basis. It's in our Tekla Structures business. We have customers who will buy for the duration of a project. So that is something closer to consumption.  I think if we were to fast forward, I don't know, I'll pick a number, 10 years. I think what comes after the typical subscription model does start to look like consumption in the -- on a longitudinal basis. And at that point, then you have to ask, are you really -- should you be talking about recurring revenue at that point, or is it total revenue to the metric shift over time. So we'll have a little bit of that consumption. But the vast majority in the next few years will look like a typical subscription model. Jonathan, so 50/50 is the answer. We think it's 50% price, 50%, I'll say, underlying unit volume. We think that weighted a bit higher on pricing, probably in the first half of the year, and we'll wait a little bit more on the unit volume in the second half of the year. There's some differences in the different businesses, ag, construction and whatnot. But there's a bit of a false precision that you can have here in trying to totally quantify this, but that's the best direction I can give you, is about half and half. So one of the things we hear from customers relative to the business model. I mean is when you have the -- when you move from CapEx to OpEx, there are a set of customers that you can reach that you weren't previously reaching. So one of the things we've seen when we transition the model in our SketchUp product, and I'll say a shout-out to that team, they're in 11 quarters in a row of over 45% year-over-year ARR growth. far exceeding what I thought was possible. They've done a terrific job. And our Tekla Structures business, that's moved to subscription. We're seeing that we're getting customers that we weren't before. So it is, I'd say, increasing the size of the addressable market. That's a very attractive thing. Okay, so at the largest companies, that's not -- we were already working with many of these companies. What they -- one of the things they like about is the ability to attach the cost of the technology to the specific jobs. So the billing out of technology. So there are some customers who are attracted to that for that reason. Some customers like the ability if they can flex licenses up or down depending on -- because we're moving more and more to named user licenses. If they can flex up or down, that provides value to our customers, and that will be something that -- and that is something that's on the top of their mind. One of the things in addition we see is we move Trimble Construction One. let's say let's talk about the frame agreement part of this is our customers of these big customers, and I met with in Europe were looking to have just one set of terms and conditions and one contract, one frame agreement for them to be able to buy Trimble. And we see some customers, not all, but some customers of the big customers looking to essentially act more like one company and really challenge some of the old paradigms of where technology decisions are made on the individual projects versus trying to drive, I'll say, more corporate efficiency and effectiveness. And so as we move -- for them, as we move the subscription offering, it makes it easier for them to consume a larger amount of Trimble technology. So I felt quite validated with the customers I've met with over the last weeks that this is very much the direction they want us to go. I'll start, and David, if I leave something out, you can jump in on this. A couple of dynamics on that inflection. If I look back to 3 months ago, we had come out of the first quarter, well, quite strong out of the first quarter. And if I take a market like European -- agriculture in Europe that had done quite well at the beginning of the year, that was the same time that we made the decision to exit Russia business. The Ukraine business is effectively shut down at the moment given the war. Between the 2, that's $65 million of revenue. It was my belief that at the 3 months ago that the market was so strong that it could absorb that $65 million, and I was looking at the backlog. I'd say, 3 months later, I was a little too optimistic on that. And if I look at the ag business for the second -- well, actually up level to the segment, the Resources and Utilities segment, we still expect double-digit organic growth in the second half of the year. And I really don't want that point to be lost through my commentary. So we're maintaining a view of double-digit organic growth in agriculture. And to me, the delta from the commentary a few months ago was -- one of the deltas is that I see less ability for that Russia business to just get absorbed into the system. And which I should also say, the majority of our Russia and Ukraine business was agriculture, a strong majority of it. Now connect to the other part of your question on the backlog, we still are running backlog that's, I'd say, a good $140 million ahead of where we would typically see backlog if we're looking back on a longitudinal basis. I think we'll end the year with a higher level of backlog than we expected 3 months ago, different by some of the different businesses in Trimble, and that connects to the commentary around supply chain. David, did I leave anything out? Okay, transportation, no exposure; agriculture -- resources and utilities excuse me, no exposure. In the geospatial and the B&I businesses are kind of up-level those, engineering and construction. I said, yes, we do have exposure to residential. It's not kind of an existential exposure. And what I'd want to say is while residential inflected, let's say, negative or worse over the last couple of months on an absolute basis, it's still a very high number. And so we haven't seen any meaningful inflections down in our business -- in our business, from residential at this point. We haven't. And I'll give you an example in the civil construction business. Over the last number of years, we moved towards putting more and more of the technology on excavators, it's the largest machine count in the world, the lowest level of penetration. That has translated over the last couple of years into more work being done on the bigger residential developments. Just on 1 single-family house, okay, you're not going to -- I don't think you're going to use -- my guess is you're going to --not many people are using the technology yet, but you take the larger developments, and they are starting to use technology for site preparation. In the vertical construction side of our business, I'd say it's a minor level of exposure that we have. I mean the geospatial business, a survey or most surveyors do multiple types of work. So there -- I wouldn't say there's many that only do 1 type of work like they only do residential. I'm not aware of surveyors who would, or at least many surveyors who would only do that. An anecdote, I was talking to one of our dealer partners in Florida, he told me that they were seeing residential go down in Florida. But at the same time, the entertainment business, the theme park work, was going way up and completely offsetting what they were seeing as a down on residential. So the work does move around. We clearly need to pay attention to it, both in Europe, as well as here in the States and then pay attention regionally as well as we've seen the movements on residential work. But our contractors are busy. They've got the backlog, they're working through it. So to me, it's going to be a question of what happens to the size of the backlog in these different end markets that are served. We obviously -- you know we think about residential. We think more about infrastructure, we think about commercial work, we think about segments such as EPC and follow the trends in all of these. So the hardware sales yes, this is hardware primarily it's associated with essentially telematics subscription. We call it our mobility business. So you buy an onboard computer that's enabling technology for the I'll call it the long tail subscription, and we sell on a per truck basis. We felt -- we have an OEM business as well as an aftermarket business. We are primarily an aftermarket business. One of the inflections down we saw in the hardware business was one of our OEM partners taking less volume in the quarter than we anticipated. And that's been fluctuating up and down because as we know, both ourselves, but in this case, an OEM partner, they've got their own supply chain fluctuations independent of Trimble. So that was one inflection on the hardware for the quarter. And then in the aftermarket, I'd say that was lower than we had anticipated as well.  We have launched an updated I'd say, offering. I talked about it in the prepared remarks. And we've got our biggest user conference in about 1.5 weeks that starts, which is our, I'd say, our best venue to roll out what we're doing in that business. So I'd say we're maybe a couple of months -- a few months behind where I thought we might be at this point and driving new business. But we are seeing the pipeline pick up around it. And then you noted the important point, which to me is the thing I didn't want to be lost in the commentary is that of ARR and the sequential growth in the ARR, and it's -- growth in ARR and sequential growth and if you look at the growth from the first quarter and then the growth into the second quarter on the ARR, that to me is the most attractive revenue stream. Well, it's the most attractive revenue stream we have in Trimble. It's the most attractive stream therefore within Transportation. And like that's where we've got to keep our eye on as continuing to drive that ARR forward in the business. So eyes are very much on that, both at the discrete product selling level, in this case, let's say, a telematics subscription, but also form of that Trimble Construction One for our transportation customers for them to be able to buy multiple solutions. So even in absence of having a frame around it, I'd say, it's well positioned as Trimble Construction One is at the moment. It's not like you have to wait to go and sell, \u201cthe house and transportation.\u201d So we've got customers today who will buy our enterprise ERP solutions plus our mobility solutions plus video plus our final mile solutions plus our mapping solutions plus our maintenance solutions. So we have customers who are buying all of that today from us. And like our other businesses, we think that there's an attractive opportunity to upsell and cross-sell within the base.  We'll talk a little bit more about it at Investor Day, but more than 90% of the top 200 trucking companies in North America are Trimble customers, today Trimble Transportation customers, and the majority of those -- very, very strong majority of those are not buying everything they could be buying from us. So we need to continue to work at the go-to-market and product level to get the, I'll say, deliver the most customer value so that we can increase the level of penetration into that market segment. Thank you all. Thank you for attending the call. We look forward to talking to you next quarter."

The rest is the mix of demand and supply. There's actually in a context of an improving supply chain overall. There are some new component supply issues that we actually didn't anticipate a quarter ago that will pinch our resource business and Geospatial. So as Rob said, that will -- that demand is not expiring. We're just going to end up for those products with a little more backlog than we expected. And then there's some residual demand. The ag business in Europe has been really tough. So all the reasons Rob mentioned. There's not only high inflation, but they've had epic heat with lack of productivity. There are issues with constrained availability of fuel. So the sentiment in the ag business globally is definitely less was a quarter ago, and we see it more in Europe. But the demand part of the guide adjustment is quite small."

I would now like to hand the conference over to Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nRobert Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Let's begin on Page 2, with gratitude and a shout-out to our team and our partners for delivering a record first quarter that exceeded our expectations. The team delivered record levels of annualized recurring revenue of $1.47 billion, revenue of $994 million and EBITDA of $253 million. Every reporting segment met or exceeded expectations and backlog stands at $1.7 billion.  Our software teams exceeded expectations on delivering ARR growth as we continue to transform our business models. And we achieved record levels of recurring software bookings in many parts of the business. On the hardware side, our operations team secured components late in the quarter to solidify our strong performance.  [Indiscernible] speaking, the story of the first quarter is that demand remains healthy, our strategy is working, and we continue to execute in a very dynamic environment.  Against this backdrop, we are raising our organic annual guidance for the year, adjusting for the impact of divestitures and currency. As many of you know, we think on a 3-4-3 operating cadence, simultaneously balancing 3 months, 4 quarters and 3 years. We aim for the same balance on these update calls. I'll start my commentary by addressing some of the specific topics you've been asking about in the 3-4 zone, namely Russia and Ukraine, supply chain, inflation and market conditions.  Starting with Russia and Ukraine. Our first priority remains the safety of our teams. For the business, we continue to pause all new sales into Russia and Belarus and our long-term planning assumption is that our 2% of revenue from the region does not come back, most of which comes from agriculture and survey hardware. Given our current backlog, we are directing as much product elsewhere as possible, and we do not anticipate a material change to 2022 company revenue.  In Ukraine, we are highly motivated to help however we can, but the practicalities on the ground are obviously very difficult. We have donated to relief efforts through our foundation and have begun preparations for how we can help with rebuild efforts.  As it relates to supply chain, the short answer is that it isn't getting easier, but we also [Technical Difficulty]. We are a purpose-driven company with a mission to transform the way the world works. On March 31, we announced a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that links 2 of our sustainability commitments, namely reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing gender diversity at Trimble. While we continue to await approval of our science-based targets, we also added ESG performance metrics to long-term incentive compensation for our named executive officers. Talk is cheap. We are taking action.  Consistent with our 3-4-3 model, I'll talk next about capital allocation and how we view ourselves as capital allocators on behalf of our shareholders. I believe how we allocate our resources, time, people and money, and how we balance that across short- and long-term horizons will ultimately determine how we are judged as operators.  In the first quarter, we executed $105 million of share buybacks. In the quarter, we put our balance sheet to work to build inventory where possible. The biggest news, though, is that we announced the sale of 5 of our businesses in the last few weeks, our precision tools business, our weighing business, our timing business, our accessories business and one of our rail businesses. This is in addition to 7 businesses we divested over the previous 2 years.  We continue to focus our efforts on developing and growing our connected industry platforms in building our digital transformation capabilities. We believe the best ongoing fit for these businesses lies outside Trimble, yet I would be remiss not to step back and acknowledge that these are our long-term colleagues and the results they delivered over the years enabled much of the transformation you see in us today. My gratitude to all these colleagues and to all of our colleagues who worked tirelessly on this effort over the last few quarters. David will walk you through the numbers in his remarks.  Moving to Page 3. Let's talk about innovation and our platform strategy. We are building industry clouds to connect stakeholders and workflows across operational life cycles. In Construction, for example, we aim to connect the complete project life cycle to automate and optimize work, establishing shared industry protocols and common data environments so that diverse stakeholders can efficiently collaborate and work across the design, build, operate stages of project delivery.  Our strategy is already delivering innovative value today based on a strong foundation of technologies in areas such as positioning and sensing, mixed reality, robotics, autonomy, data science and artificial intelligence. Through our partnership with Microsoft, we are enabling designers, engineers and contractors to collaborate with one another by interacting with richer data and more immersive models. And Trimble is the only company in the world with direct access to Microsoft's HoloLens technology that we have integrated directly into our Trimble XR10. Through our partnership with Boston Dynamics, we are at the intersection of the physical and digital world in robotics, where builders use our automated scanning solutions to capture as-built throughout the asset operational life cycle.  Through our machine control and guidance technologies, we have been working on autonomy for over 20 years. We are innovating through progressive stages of autonomy with the most recent addition of horizontal steering controls for dozers and compactors, which deliver productivity and sustainability. Our strategy also leverages Trimble product innovation into differentiated go-to-market motions. We are evolving and enhancing our commerce model to remove friction, enhance the user experience, and enable value to be captured and exchanged through more granular interactions at the point of work.  Value is increasingly tied to subscription payments and delivered on an API-driven services platform so that producers and operators can self-provision services and get real-time user feedback. As an example, our Trimble Construction One solution, as shown on Page 4, delivers a unified provisioning experience across more than 20 products and services and enables our divisions to sell persona-based bundles and discrete connected workflows. We are aggressively streamlining online experiences via self-provision subscription services that empower users to thrive and unlock new innovations for modern ecosystems and project stakeholders.  This improves real-time collaboration and interactions at scale that help us address society's most urgent challenges. To enable this strategy, we are investing heavily in our underlying digital systems. Our initial pilots are already demonstrating value by improving the productivity of our sales teams as they serve common customers. As we continue to roll out functionality in the quarters ahead, we expect to be able to deliver our commercial offerings at increasing levels of scale while generating new and impactful digital insights about our customers' journey.  I will close with a comment on our planned Investor Day in September. The 3 questions we hear most on investors' minds includes: one, the arc of our model progression; two, progress and proof points of our industry platform strategy; and three, the collective impact of the current market risks, namely recession, war, inflation and supply chain. Your feedback over the coming months will be appreciated as we prepare for this update. David?\nDavid Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of first quarter results. First quarter revenue of $994 million was up 14% organically year-on-year. Changes in foreign exchange rates subtracted 2% to revenue growth, resulting in reported growth of 12%. The strong revenue performance was broad-based. Approximately 2/3 of our 14% organic revenue growth came from volume, with the remaining 1/3 driven by the impact of price increases we have taken in the past year. Software and recurring revenue increased as expected, and hardware revenue was better than expectations, driven by the success of our operations team and getting more product through our supply chain.  Gross margin in the first quarter was 57.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year, reflecting higher product and freight costs in our supply chain, partially offset by increased pricing and improved software margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.5%, down 60 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by lower gross margins and, to a lesser extent, higher operating expenses from our strategic investments and a return to normalized expense levels.  Operating margin was 23.5%, down 10 basis points year-over-year. Net income dollars increased by 11%, and earnings per share increased by $0.07 to $0.73 per share. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $153 million and free cash flow was $139 million. Cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter as we continue to build inventory and as a result of our incentive plan payouts following very strong performance versus our 2021 objectives. Deferred revenue grew 14%, reflecting continued strong growth in recurring revenue streams.  The underlying working capital dynamics in our business remains strong, and we expect that our net working capital will remain near 0 as the year progresses even in this difficult supply chain environment. Our net debt declined over $30 million in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remains around 1.0.  Turning now to Slide 6. I'll review in more detail our first quarter revenue trends. ARR was up 12% in aggregate and up 14% organically. Our nonrecurring revenue streams grew with hardware up 11% year-over-year and perpetual software growing 8%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth contributed to perpetual software growth as some of our hardware offerings are bundled with software. From a geographic perspective, North America revenues were up 11%. In Europe, revenues were up 14%. Asia Pacific was up 5% year-over-year, and the rest of the world was up 31%. Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Organic ARR in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial and Resources and Utilities all grew in the teens or above, while transportation ARR growth was in the mid-single digits and improved sequentially. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, continued to be negative despite the build in inventory during the first quarter. Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was 14.5% of revenue, with approximately 2/3 of our R&D investments going into software development. Of our $1.7 billion in backlog, approximately $345 million represents hardware backlog, down modestly from year-end 2021 levels but still well above our historical norms. Supply chain constraints continue to be very dynamic in nature, but our team made good progress in the quarter working around constraints and executing well in a challenging environment.  Let's turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 18% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our Building and Civil Construction businesses, and organic ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter. Geospatial revenue was up 16% on an organic basis driven by strong performance in our survey and mapping business. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 16% on an organic basis driven by continued strength in agriculture in Europe, South America and the United States. Financial results in transportation showed progression in a number of areas. Revenue was up 2% on an organic basis year-over-year, and organic ARR growth improved for the third quarter in a row.  We continue to progress on the conversion of our transportation enterprise software business to recurring revenue models and made good progress on development of a new product in our mobility business, which we believe will improve both margins and competitiveness when it is launched later this year. We continue to project improved momentum in margins and ARR growth in our Transportation segment in the fourth quarter.  Turning now to Slide 9. I'd like to provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. As Rob highlighted earlier, demand remains broadly strong across the end markets we serve. High inflation, rising interest rates and the impact of the war in Ukraine are, of course, impacting sentiment around the world, but we don't see meaningful signs that these developments are reducing current demand for our offerings. Our backlog of $1.7 billion, which reflects historically high levels of hardware backlog and growth in our recurring revenue offerings, gives us significant visibility through the balance of 2022. We continue to expect supply chain challenges into 2023, although we are increasingly optimistic that we will see component availability improve in the second half of this year.  With that backdrop, I'll talk through our updated guidance. Our recently announced divestitures and the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar will both impact our financial results for the balance of 2022, so I'll focus first on organic trends. The key message here is that our organic outlook for ARR, revenue and earnings have all improved. We are raising the midpoint of our organic revenue guidance by $30 million with an updated range of $3.99 billion to $4.07 billion. That revised view reflects an organic outlook for revenue growth of 10% to 12%.  The midpoint of our organic EPS forecast has increased by $0.06 with a new EPS range of $2.85 to $3. We are raising our outlook for organic ARR growth to above 15%. Our full year outlook reflects our expectation that organic revenue growth will be in the mid-teens in our Buildings and Infrastructure and Resources and Utility segments where demand remains very strong and backlog is high. Geospatial organic growth is expected to moderate from the first quarter pace and be in the mid- to high single-digit range for the year against 27% growth in 2021. We expect that our Transportation segment will see low single-digit organic growth for the year with meaningful improvement by the fourth quarter when our initiatives to improve retention and grow ARR take hold.  The table on Page 9 of our presentation bridges this organic outlook through the impacts of the changes in exchange rates and our upcoming divestitures. The U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly versus the euro and other major currencies in the last 90 days. Assuming that exchange rates remain where they are now, we estimate the impact on our revenue from our last outlook of approximately $45 million. We expect that the divestitures will close in the second quarter and will reduce our 2022 revenues by approximately $145 million. 60% of the revenue impact is in Buildings and Infrastructure, 30% in Geospatial, and 10% in transportation.  As a result, our updated full year revenue guidance incorporating the impact of divestitures and recent changes in exchange rates is $3.80 billion to $3.88 billion. We now expect gross margins to be up approximately 100 basis points for the full year with the majority of that improvement coming in the second half. This reflects our view that the pricing actions we are taking will more than offset inflation in the second half.  Our outlook for full year operating margins has increased to a range of 23% to 23.5%. Embedded in this outlook is the assumption that operating margins will be adversely impacted by our ongoing subscription transitions as well as the investments we are making in support of our Connect and Scale strategy and the acceleration of ARR. In aggregate, these factors present a headwind to operating margins of approximately 200 basis points for the year.  Our outlook for the margin impact of subscription transitions and strategic investments is unchanged from what we presented a quarter ago. The divestitures will reduce full year EPS by approximately $0.11 and recent changes in foreign exchange rates will impact our earnings per share outlook by about $0.03, resulting in a revised full year EPS range of $2.71 to $2.86. Hardware makes up the substantial majority of the revenue of the divested businesses, and as a result, the divestitures will not have a meaningful impact on ARR trends.  Looking to 2023 and beyond, we expect that the divestitures will be accretive to both revenue growth and operating margins. More strategically, our business post divestitures will be more centered on our platform strategy and our mix of ARR and software will be higher. Forecast for income from equity investments and net interest cost is unchanged. Our tax rate guidance has increased to a range of 18.5% to 19%.  From a cash flow perspective, we project that free cash flow will be approximately equal to our non-GAAP net income with stronger performance in the second half of the year. This forecast reflects our view that our inventory levels will grow modestly and that the U.S. Congress will take action to permit the continued upfront deduction of R&D expenses. If the legislation is not passed and R&D costs are capitalized for tax purposes, then our 2022 cash flow outlook will be adversely impacted by approximately $70 million. Note that the tax capitalization of R&D cost has no meaningful impact on our book tax rates, only the timing of cash payments.  A few words on the quarterly dynamics we expect for the balance of this year. The supply chain issues have disrupted the normal seasonal patterns in our business. While the second quarter would normally be our largest quarter in absolute revenue, that is not what we expect this year. After the impact of divestitures and recent currency movements, we expect second quarter revenue to be down slightly versus the second quarter of 2021, which was unusually strong. Following the second quarter, we expect revenue to increase sequentially through the third and fourth quarters, reflecting gradual normalization in the supply chain, higher prices and increasing software and recurring growth.  From a gross margin perspective, we expect second quarter gross margins to be consistent with the first quarter and then the increase in the second half of the year as our additional pricing actions take effect. Driven by improved price realization and revenue mix, we expect gross margins will be approximately 250 basis points higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half, and operating margins will be approximately 200 basis points higher in the second half of 2022 versus the first half. We forecast second quarter earnings per share to be below second quarter 2021 earnings per share with double-digit year-on-year EPS growth in the back half of the year even after the impact of the divestitures. Most importantly, we have increased confidence in the drivers of our organic ARR progression for the remainder of the year.  Rob, back to you.\nRobert Painter: Belong, grow, innovate. These are the 3 core Trimble values. Against a challenging landscape in the context of ongoing change, I am proud of what my colleagues have accomplished, individually and collectively. I'm gratified to see that we have been named a top company culture and a top workplace for innovators. We are driven by a sense of purpose at Trimble, and we are proving that we can deliver financial results while showing up with compassion for our colleagues and our communities.  The level of curiosity and openness to growth I see displayed at Trimble gives me confidence that we can continue to execute our strategy.  Operator, let's open the line to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could just talk about the divestiture package. What are the anticipated proceeds gains and use of proceeds? I see you folks bought back more stock in the quarter. Is that the primary capital deployment plan from a short-term standpoint once the divestitures are finalized?\nDavid Barnes: Jerry, the divestitures haven't closed. We expect them to close in the second quarter. The proceeds will be a little over $200 million. I see that cash flow flowing into our overall capital allocation priorities. We are fortunate to have powder dry to do deals that will complement our strategy and growth. So that's the first priority. We are repurchasing shares. You probably saw, we did a little over $100 million in the first quarter. Our thinking is that we will continue to at least offset the dilution from stock comp and probably go a little higher given our current leverage position. But the overall priority is -- has not changed that our first focus on allocation of capital is to grow the business.\nJerry Revich: Okay. And then in terms of the second quarter guidance, looking at the high end of the potential revenue outlook year-over-year implies sequentially sales performance that's worse than normal seasonality by a few points. So I'm wondering, can you just expand on that? So I get the tough comps year-over-year, but sequentially, we have ARR growing. We have sequentially deliveries of hardware that should be up. So I'm wondering if you can just expand, David, on where you actually see the supply chain disruptions and what's driving that sequential outlook and I get the year-over-year comps?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. So the first and pretty obvious point is the impact of the divestitures and foreign exchange, which have a pretty meaningful impact year-on-year and sequentially. I think you're right to focus on ARR growth because we do see that as a more reliable barometer of the momentum of our business. There are a couple of things that do impact Q2, particularly when you're looking sequentially versus Q1 this year. The two I'd focus you on are, one, the supply chain. We actually had a very, very strong Q2 of last year. We were making a big investment in our U.S. distribution center, which actually caused more shipments to get held up at the end of Q1 of last year and get shipped out in Q2.  We kind of had the opposite phenomenon this year, where we had a very, very strong late quarter Q1 shipment pattern. You saw how strong our hardware shipments. That actually drove our backlog down a little bit, which is a good thing. And we are seeing some latent effects of the shutdowns in China. So there are a couple of factors that make organic growth tough on the hardware side.  With regard to software, the issue is on our term license business, which is a growing part of our recurring revenue stream. A lot of our recurring revenue contracts renew in Q1, The accounting standards have term licenses, all the revenue hits when -- or the majority of the revenue hits when the term begins. And so that really causes sequential trends to look worse than the long-term trends would be, Q1 to Q2.\nOperator: Your next question from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital.\nJason Celino: So Rob, you mentioned record software bookings in several parts of the business. I'm curious what areas did you see the strength? And then how much of that is related to maybe internal execution versus the current buying sentiment?\nRobert Painter: So the recurring software bookings were pretty spread across the business. So it wasn't concentrated in any particular segment. And I'd say that both at the ARR growth level in the first quarter as well as at the bookings line. From an internal versus external perspective, in the construction side of the business, so that will show up in Buildings and Infrastructure. There, I would attribute some more of the bookings growth to internal execution because that's where we have the initial launches with our new digital tools and the Trimble Construction One offering that we have the slide on. So that is where we could actually see a lift in the bookings, and I would call that internal execution of an offering that's there to meet the market demand for it.  So I'd say most of it is, I would say, external facing and then there's certainly an aspect of internal. And that gives me confidence because we're in early days of our digital systems enabling us to launch these bundled solutions. So I'm bullish on this portfolio.\nJason Celino: Okay. Perfect. That's good color. And then, David, on kind of the second half gross margin improvement, the confidence there. Is this any -- is this in part at all to some of the divestments being maybe lower margin or is it really just purely on the price realization of maybe some of the increases?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. I'll say the -- what we're divesting is hardware businesses, and they are, on average, lower gross margin than the rest. So yes, the divestitures help a little bit. But the much bigger driver is the dynamic of the mix of our business with a greater mix of software, and we'll see the positive impact of the pricing. We actually -- we'll be lapping some of the inflation. And we think we're going to benefit from some normalization of the supply chain. The way I'd characterize that is that we project we will be less reliant on the broker market for key components in the second half of the year than we have been for the last few quarters that will still be with us in Q2.  So we're not in a normal world. We're in an inflationary world, but the -- some of the spikes in input costs will be more manageable and we'll get the full impact of the price increases that we've announced now, which take time to get through the backlog. So those factors, plus the mix, will improve our margins in the second half.\nOperator: Our next question from Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan.\nTami Zakaria: So I think last quarter, you highlighted challenges around freight costs and aggressive broker pricing on key components. Have you seen any moderation year-to-date?\nDavid Barnes: I wouldn't say moderation, no. I would say more signs that we've hit the peak and that we don't see acceleration in input costs. And then particularly looking to the second half, Tami, where we expect to see moderation is in our reliance on the broker market, which is where a meaningful part of our cost inflation comes from. So you'll have a part that has a normal standard cost of $1 or $2 or $3 that's available in the broker market for many, many times, 10, in some cases, even 100x the normal cost. So that's been driving a lot of our cost inflation, and we think that impact will be mitigated in the second half.\nTami Zakaria: Understood. And just one quick clarification question. I believe you said you now expect a higher organic revenue growth rate for the year. How much of it is volume versus price driven?\nDavid Barnes: Our -- most of it is volume. Our prices have firmed up a little bit. So we've been -- like a lot of businesses, we've been struggling to estimate how much inflation will be. And so our price outlook is a little better than it was last time, but the bigger driver is that our business is really strong and our ability to execute in the supply chain is a little stronger than we expected last time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jonathan Ho from William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: I just wanted to start with Construction One. How much of a lift does the platform provide relative to your traditional solutions when you think about selling through? And then how does that maybe impact something like net expansion over time?\nRobert Painter: Jonathan, it's Rob. So the slide showed Trimble Construction One contractor offering. It's a persona-based offering. What will come next is an architecture and design persona offering and owner persona offering. Within that contractor offering, the early signs we're seeing and we saw it in Q1 play through for us as is we saw really double-digit growth in cross -- what we call cross-sell bookings where we could see the velocity of bookings increased from that offering. We saw our win rates go up significantly. We saw the deal sizes be higher. We saw the sales cycles be lower. And all of that drove bookings up. So Jonathan, for us it's a really good sign that we're on a good path here.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. Got it. And then just given sort of the backlog position that you have, is all of the backlog noncancelable? And are you seeing any evidence of maybe pull forward in demand, just given where lead times are?\nRobert Painter: We haven't seen any discernible signs of cancellation in the backlog, Jonathan. So -- and hey, looking from the competitive market standpoint, it's not like there's many places to go. I mean everyone has a supply chain challenge to work through. But I think the real story is it's the efficacy of the value proposition you get from Trimble technology is what's making the backlogs sticky.\nOperator: Next question from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.\nKristen Owen: This is Kristen on for Colin. Wanted to ask about Geospatial, several quarters in a row now of strong growth. You did talk about sort of comps getting tougher in the back half of the year. But that's a segment that just continues to surprise to the upside. I'm wondering if you can provide some additional detail on the drivers there, any sort of specific end markets or applications. And how we should think about sort of attach rates for ARR following those hardware sales?\nRobert Painter: It's Rob. So first, I'd shout out to all of our colleagues in Geospatial. They just continued a terrific run in the business. I'll give you a few comments. First, on the innovation side, and this is where the team deserves a lot of credit. So the number of new product introductions has really helped our global distribution channel be able to message out into the market. So whether it's a tilt compensation on our GNSS products. Laser scanner has been doing quite well for us. Mobile mapping business has been doing well, so has monitoring business unit.  At an end market level where we've seen strengths are in Departments of Transportation. So I think infrastructure, think defense actually is also doing reasonably well. The net of all of that is we believe we're gaining market share in the business. And then I'd complement that by also talking about the go-to-market side, and the team has done a really nice job of working with our global dealer channel to drive the business forward.\nKristen Owen: That's really helpful, Rob. And then I wanted to follow up on just sort of a longer-term question. You're tracking well ahead of the 55% software recurring revenue target that you outlined, granted the last Investor Day was a number of years ago, but well ahead of that target even with the outside strength that you've had in hardware in the last several years. So now with the divestitures, that's pointing even higher, what's sort of the right settling point under this new Trimble model? And how should we think about that going forward in terms of your long-term operating margin outlook?\nRobert Painter: Well, from a percent of the business, okay, the divestitures alone, you can think of that as 350 plus or minus basis points increase in the mix. In other words, more software mix. The thing that's always difficult with the percentages, Kristen, is if the hardware business continues to do well, and I think it will on the heels of coming infrastructure spend, we would expect that to benefit our hardware businesses, especially in the engineering and construction side of Trimble. So that, by the math, I think that, that would throttle that increased expansion in the percent of software. And ultimately, obviously, we take the dollars to the bank, not the percentages.  If I were to say all things equal, what we've seen over a long baseline now is our recurring revenue is growing faster than our perpetual. It's been growing faster than our hardware. So take that baseline and if we're already in the now post divestiture in the high 50% of that mix, that's naturally moving towards a 60 -- 6 in front of it, so 60-plus percent. When you look at the growth in ARR, David mentioned raising our view on ARR during the year. And so -- and then that's before any, let's say, impact of future acquisitions and how that may further the mix. So 6, in front of it is where it's trending. And as we move towards Investor Day, I think we can sharpen the pencil on that.  Your other question around operating leverage. I mean, certainly, it's our long-term view as you get through model transitions that the nature of the gross margins in the business and a recurring revenue business and software business for that matter are such that we should be able to increase the operating leverage over time. So our historical baseline has been plus or minus 25%, and that looks like something heading towards a 30%, something with a 3 in front of it is where we think about the long-term model, Kristen.\nKristen Owen: Congrats on the nice results.\nOperator: Our next question from Rob Mason.\nRobert Mason: I wanted to know, Rob or David, in the parts of the business where you have OEM exposure, how was the OEM versus aftermarket growth rate comparing? And specifically, how are you seeing OEM production schedules trend? Are they loosening up? They're under their own production constraints, but are they loosening up? Or just directionally, how that part of the business is trending versus the aftermarket?\nRobert Painter: I think there's a little bit of a mixed story on that, Rob. We've certainly seen some areas of the portfolio where production is increasing, and we're seeing our business increase. And then I've seen others where it remains a bit challenged. So I have to say it's a little bit of a mixed view, not a totally consistent view. My read-through of OEM reports this quarter suggests that they're seeing tight supply chains as well for the rest of the year.  And as you know, we primarily orient ourselves around the aftermarket and serving the mixed fleet. And what we're seeing in the aftermarket is continued strong uptake and adoption of the technology, and that really is the growth catalyst for the business.\nRobert Mason: Is it fair to say the OEM portions, though, do show growth this year, volume growth?\nRobert Painter: Absolutely. Yes, absolutely.\nRobert Mason: Okay. And just as a follow-up, as well, Rob, the portfolio has obviously changed over -- certainly in the last 10 years or last time that we entered any type of significant recession and who knows what lies ahead. But can you just discuss some of the businesses that have come into the portfolio since then? And how you might think about, again, I'm thinking about some of the B&I software, in particular, how they have performed historically in periods when it's gotten tougher? Just kind of the durability around the recurring revenue elements there.\nRobert Painter: Yes. No, it's a good question. So it may give you a historical comparison on the business mix and why we see our portfolio today being so much more resilient than in the past. And I'll give you a comparison of 2012 to our 2021 numbers. In 2012, the percent recurring revenue we had was about 18%. And in 2021, it was 34% of our business, and that correlates to that $1.47 billion of ARR that we exited Q1 with. Overall, software and services were 32% of our revenue in 2012, 55% at the end of 2021. If we look at the operating income in 2012, 76% of our operating income came from 2 of the segments, Geospatial and Resources and Utilities, and that was 53% in 2021.  So the message is the portfolio has become much more balanced across the end markets that we serve over the last years, much more software-centric, much more recurring within that. So that gives us visibility and predictability into the model looking forward. If I look at the -- you asked about Buildings and Infrastructure in particular, that is a business that's absolutely transformed over the last 10 years. Today, that's approaching 3/4 of our segment and software today in Buildings and Infrastructure, and that would have been almost entirely hardware if you go back to the past.  And then when we've looked at a baseline as well over time of how we've performed in times of recession or difficult economic environments, we only have a small number of years where we've ever actually have seen revenue go down in time. We were, in that first COVID in 2020, we were down about 4% in revenue. We look back to the financial crisis, we look back to 9/11, we look back to the commodity price collapse. There's just 4 years we can look back to where we ever had a revenue decline. And so I mapped that against what today is a much stronger and more resilient business model. And that's what gives us -- it's one of the many things that gives us confidence and conviction to continue to invest in our business.\nOperator: Let's proceed to the next question from Chad Dillard from Bernstein.\nChad Dillard: So I was hoping we could dig a little bit more into Viewpoint and e-Builder. Just what has the revenue growth been over this last quarter? What are you seeing in terms of order levels? And how are you thinking about those businesses in terms of 2022?\nRobert Painter: ARR growth in the mid- to upper teens in those businesses. The Viewpoint business, I know we had a record first quarter bookings. We look at the intersection of -- actually look at the Viewpoint business specifically, the Trimble Construction One Contractor Cloud, our Viewpoint business is a major component of that offering. And so a good amount of the cross-sell sales that we produced or booked in the first quarter were a result of that part of the portfolio. So we continue to see really good things out of those businesses. We continue to see customers who are asking us to connect the data flows that we have resident in the contractor management system, which is what the Viewpoint business provides to be able to connect that to what's happening in the field, to be able to connect that to subcontractor systems.  What we see on the e-Builder side of the business, which is really serving capital program management for owners of the construction projects. We increasingly have customers who are also using our Cityworks software for enterprise asset management. And now with our recent acquisition of AgileAssets, think about the operational maintenance phase, work and the management of that. We have customers who are asking us to integrate the data and the workflow between these packages. So it really, from my perspective, is confirming that we're on the right path with Connect and Scale and our industry platform strategy.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And then just moving over to transportation. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on -- your views on the path to normalization. And maybe you could kind of like break it down to two discussions. One on the volume side, and then two, on we can control more any potential like restructuring the cost base. And ultimately, I guess, kind of do you still think this is a core business?\nDavid Barnes: Chad, it's David. I'll say we did take action this quarter to cut our costs. We've reduced our facility footprint and made a reduction in a piece of the transportation team. As I think about the path forward, I do believe we have strong visibility to the key metrics improving, particularly late this year and the metrics I focus on are our ARR growth and our margins. But if you look at the pieces of the business, we've got a model transformation going on in the enterprise software business. We're seeing good receptivity on our recurring revenue model offerings with customers. We're converting existing customers and winning new logos in that business. So that's a good outlook. It's hard to see it in the revenue line as these transitions always are. But in terms of booking and ARR momentum, we feel really good there.  On the mobility side of the business, the real progress we've made in the last quarter is proving out a new product, which will be released later this year in the second half. We've got that in beta test with a major customer and the outlook is really good. That new product will provide more features, make us much more competitive with some of the competitors who we've lost business to. It will also be better from a margin profile perspective. So the progress we're making there is allowing us to hang on to more of our existing customers, and we believe we've got a really compelling offering for new logos. So we think that will help us in the back half of the year.  We also have a Maps business in our Transportation segment. That is very, very strong. It's growing really well in the United States and in Europe, really posting excellent numbers. So I put all that together, and I know we're in a \"show me\" mode here. but we think we got a couple of more quarters where we're getting the engine going and then by the fourth quarter. We do believe that we'll have -- we'll be on a path to really demonstrable improvement.  As it relates to your broader question about transportation in our portfolio, if you think about our mission of transforming the way the world works using digital technology and connected platforms to optimize critical workflows, Transportation really fits very well into that theme, and we think we can make this a very good business.\nOperator: Our last question is from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.\nErik Lapinski: This is Erik on for Meta. Maybe if we could just -- if you could help us kind of better understand some of the dynamics in Europe. And as we think about the broader Russia-Ukraine impact, it sounded like you're not seeing much sign of disruption there. But I'm wondering as you -- that region maybe is impacted, are you seeing a pickup in other areas to kind of obviously global food needs to be supplied from somewhere. So wondering if you're seeing somewhat of a positive offset within the business from that in other regions?\nRobert Painter: It's Rob. Let's just start at Europe. Europe growth in the quarter was 14%. That would have been higher yet, because that haircut's for FX. So in the high teens growth rate. So demonstrable, let's say, evidence that Europe produced in the quarter, and that was reasonably broad-based across all of our segments. Let's talk about Russia and Belarus, Ukraine and the dynamic and I'll focus first really on Russia, Belarus. So yes, at this point, we don't anticipate the revenue coming back. That business is largely agriculture and geospatial oriented. So now let's talk about the agriculture aspect of that business. Yes, the fact of the matter is that 13% of the world's calorie production is now off of the market. The fact of the matter is that with the fertilizer that comes out of that region. And now I'd say the lack of fertilizer are coming out of that region, you would expect to see lower yields around -- of crop around the world.  That does provide the backdrop for what we see in commodity prices. Look at corn around 8, soy over 16. That food is going to be -- need to be produced somewhere. It doesn't happen overnight as we know. There's obviously a growing cycle to that. We would look at market. So I think about Brazil, I think about Canada, I do think about North America, Australia. And as we have a global footprint, we certainly turn our attention -- incrementally turn our attention to those markets.  Now in the short term, the reality is that we have a lot of backlog in our agriculture business. And so in the short term, and I'll define short term as 2022, we don't see a material change to our revenue because we can direct that backlog elsewhere. It's really looking forward after that.  And then if I take Ukraine specifically, we are doing everything we can to help our dealers in the region, it's really inspiring to see a number of our employees and partners continuing to find a way to actually make some of the business go. And so we'll do everything we can to help our customers and partners and the people in that region. And let's hope that, that crop can come back online before too long.\nErik Lapinski: Got it. That's really helpful. And then if we could just go back to the supply chain dynamics. I mean, obviously, you did find better component availability towards the end of the quarter. I'm curious, was that just -- was that you having a willingness to kind of buy on the spot market where available or did you actually see some regular suppliers having better availability of supply, I guess, just trying to understand if it's more spot or kind of normal supply related.\nDavid Barnes: Erik, I'll say it's very unpredictable. Everybody in the supply chain is hand to mouth. The numbers we posted for the first quarter reflect in part the fact that on a number of really constrained key components that were the gateway for us delivering full kit to our dealer customers, a bunch came in. So I think what happened was we're holding nothing back. They're holding nothing back. Just some constraints loosened just in the last few weeks of the quarter. So it's very hard to predict. And frankly, we ended up -- we ended the quarter stronger than we expected to and that was just driven by the availability of some key components we're waiting on. It doesn't reflect really any change in our approach or strategy, it's just the way product flowed in.\nErik Lapinski: Okay. Great. Congrats on a good quarter in a really tough environment.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.\nMichael Leyba: Thank you, everyone. We appreciate your time today, and we'll look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "David Barnes",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 5 with a review of first quarter results. First quarter revenue of $994 million was up 14% organically year-on-year. Changes in foreign exchange rates subtracted 2% to revenue growth, resulting in reported growth of 12%. The strong revenue performance was broad-based. Approximately 2/3 of our 14% organic revenue growth came from volume, with the remaining 1/3 driven by the impact of price increases we have taken in the past year. Software and recurring revenue increased as expected, and hardware revenue was better than expectations, driven by the success of our operations team and getting more product through our supply chain.  Gross margin in the first quarter was 57.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year, reflecting higher product and freight costs in our supply chain, partially offset by increased pricing and improved software margins. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.5%, down 60 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by lower gross margins and, to a lesser extent, higher operating expenses from our strategic investments and a return to normalized expense levels.  Operating margin was 23.5%, down 10 basis points year-over-year. Net income dollars increased by 11%, and earnings per share increased by $0.07 to $0.73 per share. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $153 million and free cash flow was $139 million. Cash flow was down year-over-year in the quarter as we continue to build inventory and as a result of our incentive plan payouts following very strong performance versus our 2021 objectives. Deferred revenue grew 14%, reflecting continued strong growth in recurring revenue streams.  The underlying working capital dynamics in our business remains strong, and we expect that our net working capital will remain near 0 as the year progresses even in this difficult supply chain environment. Our net debt declined over $30 million in the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remains around 1.0.  Turning now to Slide 6. I'll review in more detail our first quarter revenue trends. ARR was up 12% in aggregate and up 14% organically. Our nonrecurring revenue streams grew with hardware up 11% year-over-year and perpetual software growing 8%. Our hardware growth was driven by strong performance in civil construction, geospatial and agriculture. Our hardware growth contributed to perpetual software growth as some of our hardware offerings are bundled with software. From a geographic perspective, North America revenues were up 11%. In Europe, revenues were up 14%. Asia Pacific was up 5% year-over-year, and the rest of the world was up 31%. Next, on Slide 7, we highlight some of the key metrics that we follow. Organic ARR in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial and Resources and Utilities all grew in the teens or above, while transportation ARR growth was in the mid-single digits and improved sequentially. Net working capital, inclusive of deferred revenue, continued to be negative despite the build in inventory during the first quarter. Research and development on a trailing 12-month basis was 14.5% of revenue, with approximately 2/3 of our R&D investments going into software development. Of our $1.7 billion in backlog, approximately $345 million represents hardware backlog, down modestly from year-end 2021 levels but still well above our historical norms. Supply chain constraints continue to be very dynamic in nature, but our team made good progress in the quarter working around constraints and executing well in a challenging environment.  Let's turn now to Slide 8 for additional detail on each of the reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 18% on an organic basis. Revenue growth was strong in both our Building and Civil Construction businesses, and organic ARR was up in the high teens in the quarter. Geospatial revenue was up 16% on an organic basis driven by strong performance in our survey and mapping business. Resources and Utilities revenue was up 16% on an organic basis driven by continued strength in agriculture in Europe, South America and the United States. Financial results in transportation showed progression in a number of areas. Revenue was up 2% on an organic basis year-over-year, and organic ARR growth improved for the third quarter in a row.  We continue to progress on the conversion of our transportation enterprise software business to recurring revenue models and made good progress on development of a new product in our mobility business, which we believe will improve both margins and competitiveness when it is launched later this year. We continue to project improved momentum in margins and ARR growth in our Transportation segment in the fourth quarter.  Turning now to Slide 9. I'd like to provide our updated financial outlook for 2022. As Rob highlighted earlier, demand remains broadly strong across the end markets we serve. High inflation, rising interest rates and the impact of the war in Ukraine are, of course, impacting sentiment around the world, but we don't see meaningful signs that these developments are reducing current demand for our offerings. Our backlog of $1.7 billion, which reflects historically high levels of hardware backlog and growth in our recurring revenue offerings, gives us significant visibility through the balance of 2022. We continue to expect supply chain challenges into 2023, although we are increasingly optimistic that we will see component availability improve in the second half of this year.  With that backdrop, I'll talk through our updated guidance. Our recently announced divestitures and the strengthening of the value of the U.S. dollar will both impact our financial results for the balance of 2022, so I'll focus first on organic trends. The key message here is that our organic outlook for ARR, revenue and earnings have all improved. We are raising the midpoint of our organic revenue guidance by $30 million with an updated range of $3.99 billion to $4.07 billion. That revised view reflects an organic outlook for revenue growth of 10% to 12%.  The midpoint of our organic EPS forecast has increased by $0.06 with a new EPS range of $2.85 to $3. We are raising our outlook for organic ARR growth to above 15%. Our full year outlook reflects our expectation that organic revenue growth will be in the mid-teens in our Buildings and Infrastructure and Resources and Utility segments where demand remains very strong and backlog is high. Geospatial organic growth is expected to moderate from the first quarter pace and be in the mid- to high single-digit range for the year against 27% growth in 2021. We expect that our Transportation segment will see low single-digit organic growth for the year with meaningful improvement by the fourth quarter when our initiatives to improve retention and grow ARR take hold.  The table on Page 9 of our presentation bridges this organic outlook through the impacts of the changes in exchange rates and our upcoming divestitures. The U.S. dollar has appreciated significantly versus the euro and other major currencies in the last 90 days. Assuming that exchange rates remain where they are now, we estimate the impact on our revenue from our last outlook of approximately $45 million. We expect that the divestitures will close in the second quarter and will reduce our 2022 revenues by approximately $145 million. 60% of the revenue impact is in Buildings and Infrastructure, 30% in Geospatial, and 10% in transportation.  As a result, our updated full year revenue guidance incorporating the impact of divestitures and recent changes in exchange rates is $3.80 billion to $3.88 billion. We now expect gross margins to be up approximately 100 basis points for the full year with the majority of that improvement coming in the second half. This reflects our view that the pricing actions we are taking will more than offset inflation in the second half.  Our outlook for full year operating margins has increased to a range of 23% to 23.5%. Embedded in this outlook is the assumption that operating margins will be adversely impacted by our ongoing subscription transitions as well as the investments we are making in support of our Connect and Scale strategy and the acceleration of ARR. In aggregate, these factors present a headwind to operating margins of approximately 200 basis points for the year.  Our outlook for the margin impact of subscription transitions and strategic investments is unchanged from what we presented a quarter ago. The divestitures will reduce full year EPS by approximately $0.11 and recent changes in foreign exchange rates will impact our earnings per share outlook by about $0.03, resulting in a revised full year EPS range of $2.71 to $2.86. Hardware makes up the substantial majority of the revenue of the divested businesses, and as a result, the divestitures will not have a meaningful impact on ARR trends.  Looking to 2023 and beyond, we expect that the divestitures will be accretive to both revenue growth and operating margins. More strategically, our business post divestitures will be more centered on our platform strategy and our mix of ARR and software will be higher. Forecast for income from equity investments and net interest cost is unchanged. Our tax rate guidance has increased to a range of 18.5% to 19%.  From a cash flow perspective, we project that free cash flow will be approximately equal to our non-GAAP net income with stronger performance in the second half of the year. This forecast reflects our view that our inventory levels will grow modestly and that the U.S. Congress will take action to permit the continued upfront deduction of R&D expenses. If the legislation is not passed and R&D costs are capitalized for tax purposes, then our 2022 cash flow outlook will be adversely impacted by approximately $70 million. Note that the tax capitalization of R&D cost has no meaningful impact on our book tax rates, only the timing of cash payments.  A few words on the quarterly dynamics we expect for the balance of this year. The supply chain issues have disrupted the normal seasonal patterns in our business. While the second quarter would normally be our largest quarter in absolute revenue, that is not what we expect this year. After the impact of divestitures and recent currency movements, we expect second quarter revenue to be down slightly versus the second quarter of 2021, which was unusually strong. Following the second quarter, we expect revenue to increase sequentially through the third and fourth quarters, reflecting gradual normalization in the supply chain, higher prices and increasing software and recurring growth.  From a gross margin perspective, we expect second quarter gross margins to be consistent with the first quarter and then the increase in the second half of the year as our additional pricing actions take effect. Driven by improved price realization and revenue mix, we expect gross margins will be approximately 250 basis points higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half, and operating margins will be approximately 200 basis points higher in the second half of 2022 versus the first half. We forecast second quarter earnings per share to be below second quarter 2021 earnings per share with double-digit year-on-year EPS growth in the back half of the year even after the impact of the divestitures. Most importantly, we have increased confidence in the drivers of our organic ARR progression for the remainder of the year.  Rob, back to you. Jerry, the divestitures haven't closed. We expect them to close in the second quarter. The proceeds will be a little over $200 million. I see that cash flow flowing into our overall capital allocation priorities. We are fortunate to have powder dry to do deals that will complement our strategy and growth. So that's the first priority. We are repurchasing shares. You probably saw, we did a little over $100 million in the first quarter. Our thinking is that we will continue to at least offset the dilution from stock comp and probably go a little higher given our current leverage position. But the overall priority is -- has not changed that our first focus on allocation of capital is to grow the business. Yes. So the first and pretty obvious point is the impact of the divestitures and foreign exchange, which have a pretty meaningful impact year-on-year and sequentially. I think you're right to focus on ARR growth because we do see that as a more reliable barometer of the momentum of our business. There are a couple of things that do impact Q2, particularly when you're looking sequentially versus Q1 this year. The two I'd focus you on are, one, the supply chain. We actually had a very, very strong Q2 of last year. We were making a big investment in our U.S. distribution center, which actually caused more shipments to get held up at the end of Q1 of last year and get shipped out in Q2.  We kind of had the opposite phenomenon this year, where we had a very, very strong late quarter Q1 shipment pattern. You saw how strong our hardware shipments. That actually drove our backlog down a little bit, which is a good thing. And we are seeing some latent effects of the shutdowns in China. So there are a couple of factors that make organic growth tough on the hardware side.  With regard to software, the issue is on our term license business, which is a growing part of our recurring revenue stream. A lot of our recurring revenue contracts renew in Q1, The accounting standards have term licenses, all the revenue hits when -- or the majority of the revenue hits when the term begins. And so that really causes sequential trends to look worse than the long-term trends would be, Q1 to Q2. Yes. I'll say the -- what we're divesting is hardware businesses, and they are, on average, lower gross margin than the rest. So yes, the divestitures help a little bit. But the much bigger driver is the dynamic of the mix of our business with a greater mix of software, and we'll see the positive impact of the pricing. We actually -- we'll be lapping some of the inflation. And we think we're going to benefit from some normalization of the supply chain. The way I'd characterize that is that we project we will be less reliant on the broker market for key components in the second half of the year than we have been for the last few quarters that will still be with us in Q2.  So we're not in a normal world. We're in an inflationary world, but the -- some of the spikes in input costs will be more manageable and we'll get the full impact of the price increases that we've announced now, which take time to get through the backlog. So those factors, plus the mix, will improve our margins in the second half. I wouldn't say moderation, no. I would say more signs that we've hit the peak and that we don't see acceleration in input costs. And then particularly looking to the second half, Tami, where we expect to see moderation is in our reliance on the broker market, which is where a meaningful part of our cost inflation comes from. So you'll have a part that has a normal standard cost of $1 or $2 or $3 that's available in the broker market for many, many times, 10, in some cases, even 100x the normal cost. So that's been driving a lot of our cost inflation, and we think that impact will be mitigated in the second half. Our -- most of it is volume. Our prices have firmed up a little bit. So we've been -- like a lot of businesses, we've been struggling to estimate how much inflation will be. And so our price outlook is a little better than it was last time, but the bigger driver is that our business is really strong and our ability to execute in the supply chain is a little stronger than we expected last time. Chad, it's David. I'll say we did take action this quarter to cut our costs. We've reduced our facility footprint and made a reduction in a piece of the transportation team. As I think about the path forward, I do believe we have strong visibility to the key metrics improving, particularly late this year and the metrics I focus on are our ARR growth and our margins. But if you look at the pieces of the business, we've got a model transformation going on in the enterprise software business. We're seeing good receptivity on our recurring revenue model offerings with customers. We're converting existing customers and winning new logos in that business. So that's a good outlook. It's hard to see it in the revenue line as these transitions always are. But in terms of booking and ARR momentum, we feel really good there.  On the mobility side of the business, the real progress we've made in the last quarter is proving out a new product, which will be released later this year in the second half. We've got that in beta test with a major customer and the outlook is really good. That new product will provide more features, make us much more competitive with some of the competitors who we've lost business to. It will also be better from a margin profile perspective. So the progress we're making there is allowing us to hang on to more of our existing customers, and we believe we've got a really compelling offering for new logos. So we think that will help us in the back half of the year.  We also have a Maps business in our Transportation segment. That is very, very strong. It's growing really well in the United States and in Europe, really posting excellent numbers. So I put all that together, and I know we're in a \"show me\" mode here. but we think we got a couple of more quarters where we're getting the engine going and then by the fourth quarter. We do believe that we'll have -- we'll be on a path to really demonstrable improvement.  As it relates to your broader question about transportation in our portfolio, if you think about our mission of transforming the way the world works using digital technology and connected platforms to optimize critical workflows, Transportation really fits very well into that theme, and we think we can make this a very good business. Erik, I'll say it's very unpredictable. Everybody in the supply chain is hand to mouth. The numbers we posted for the first quarter reflect in part the fact that on a number of really constrained key components that were the gateway for us delivering full kit to our dealer customers, a bunch came in. So I think what happened was we're holding nothing back. They're holding nothing back. Just some constraints loosened just in the last few weeks of the quarter. So it's very hard to predict. And frankly, we ended up -- we ended the quarter stronger than we expected to and that was just driven by the availability of some key components we're waiting on. It doesn't reflect really any change in our approach or strategy, it's just the way product flowed in."

            "name": "Robert Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Let's begin on Page 2, with gratitude and a shout-out to our team and our partners for delivering a record first quarter that exceeded our expectations. The team delivered record levels of annualized recurring revenue of $1.47 billion, revenue of $994 million and EBITDA of $253 million. Every reporting segment met or exceeded expectations and backlog stands at $1.7 billion.  Our software teams exceeded expectations on delivering ARR growth as we continue to transform our business models. And we achieved record levels of recurring software bookings in many parts of the business. On the hardware side, our operations team secured components late in the quarter to solidify our strong performance.  [Indiscernible] speaking, the story of the first quarter is that demand remains healthy, our strategy is working, and we continue to execute in a very dynamic environment.  Against this backdrop, we are raising our organic annual guidance for the year, adjusting for the impact of divestitures and currency. As many of you know, we think on a 3-4-3 operating cadence, simultaneously balancing 3 months, 4 quarters and 3 years. We aim for the same balance on these update calls. I'll start my commentary by addressing some of the specific topics you've been asking about in the 3-4 zone, namely Russia and Ukraine, supply chain, inflation and market conditions.  Starting with Russia and Ukraine. Our first priority remains the safety of our teams. For the business, we continue to pause all new sales into Russia and Belarus and our long-term planning assumption is that our 2% of revenue from the region does not come back, most of which comes from agriculture and survey hardware. Given our current backlog, we are directing as much product elsewhere as possible, and we do not anticipate a material change to 2022 company revenue.  In Ukraine, we are highly motivated to help however we can, but the practicalities on the ground are obviously very difficult. We have donated to relief efforts through our foundation and have begun preparations for how we can help with rebuild efforts.  As it relates to supply chain, the short answer is that it isn't getting easier, but we also [Technical Difficulty]. We are a purpose-driven company with a mission to transform the way the world works. On March 31, we announced a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that links 2 of our sustainability commitments, namely reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing gender diversity at Trimble. While we continue to await approval of our science-based targets, we also added ESG performance metrics to long-term incentive compensation for our named executive officers. Talk is cheap. We are taking action.  Consistent with our 3-4-3 model, I'll talk next about capital allocation and how we view ourselves as capital allocators on behalf of our shareholders. I believe how we allocate our resources, time, people and money, and how we balance that across short- and long-term horizons will ultimately determine how we are judged as operators.  In the first quarter, we executed $105 million of share buybacks. In the quarter, we put our balance sheet to work to build inventory where possible. The biggest news, though, is that we announced the sale of 5 of our businesses in the last few weeks, our precision tools business, our weighing business, our timing business, our accessories business and one of our rail businesses. This is in addition to 7 businesses we divested over the previous 2 years.  We continue to focus our efforts on developing and growing our connected industry platforms in building our digital transformation capabilities. We believe the best ongoing fit for these businesses lies outside Trimble, yet I would be remiss not to step back and acknowledge that these are our long-term colleagues and the results they delivered over the years enabled much of the transformation you see in us today. My gratitude to all these colleagues and to all of our colleagues who worked tirelessly on this effort over the last few quarters. David will walk you through the numbers in his remarks.  Moving to Page 3. Let's talk about innovation and our platform strategy. We are building industry clouds to connect stakeholders and workflows across operational life cycles. In Construction, for example, we aim to connect the complete project life cycle to automate and optimize work, establishing shared industry protocols and common data environments so that diverse stakeholders can efficiently collaborate and work across the design, build, operate stages of project delivery.  Our strategy is already delivering innovative value today based on a strong foundation of technologies in areas such as positioning and sensing, mixed reality, robotics, autonomy, data science and artificial intelligence. Through our partnership with Microsoft, we are enabling designers, engineers and contractors to collaborate with one another by interacting with richer data and more immersive models. And Trimble is the only company in the world with direct access to Microsoft's HoloLens technology that we have integrated directly into our Trimble XR10. Through our partnership with Boston Dynamics, we are at the intersection of the physical and digital world in robotics, where builders use our automated scanning solutions to capture as-built throughout the asset operational life cycle.  Through our machine control and guidance technologies, we have been working on autonomy for over 20 years. We are innovating through progressive stages of autonomy with the most recent addition of horizontal steering controls for dozers and compactors, which deliver productivity and sustainability. Our strategy also leverages Trimble product innovation into differentiated go-to-market motions. We are evolving and enhancing our commerce model to remove friction, enhance the user experience, and enable value to be captured and exchanged through more granular interactions at the point of work.  Value is increasingly tied to subscription payments and delivered on an API-driven services platform so that producers and operators can self-provision services and get real-time user feedback. As an example, our Trimble Construction One solution, as shown on Page 4, delivers a unified provisioning experience across more than 20 products and services and enables our divisions to sell persona-based bundles and discrete connected workflows. We are aggressively streamlining online experiences via self-provision subscription services that empower users to thrive and unlock new innovations for modern ecosystems and project stakeholders.  This improves real-time collaboration and interactions at scale that help us address society's most urgent challenges. To enable this strategy, we are investing heavily in our underlying digital systems. Our initial pilots are already demonstrating value by improving the productivity of our sales teams as they serve common customers. As we continue to roll out functionality in the quarters ahead, we expect to be able to deliver our commercial offerings at increasing levels of scale while generating new and impactful digital insights about our customers' journey.  I will close with a comment on our planned Investor Day in September. The 3 questions we hear most on investors' minds includes: one, the arc of our model progression; two, progress and proof points of our industry platform strategy; and three, the collective impact of the current market risks, namely recession, war, inflation and supply chain. Your feedback over the coming months will be appreciated as we prepare for this update. David? Belong, grow, innovate. These are the 3 core Trimble values. Against a challenging landscape in the context of ongoing change, I am proud of what my colleagues have accomplished, individually and collectively. I'm gratified to see that we have been named a top company culture and a top workplace for innovators. We are driven by a sense of purpose at Trimble, and we are proving that we can deliver financial results while showing up with compassion for our colleagues and our communities.  The level of curiosity and openness to growth I see displayed at Trimble gives me confidence that we can continue to execute our strategy.  Operator, let's open the line to questions. So the recurring software bookings were pretty spread across the business. So it wasn't concentrated in any particular segment. And I'd say that both at the ARR growth level in the first quarter as well as at the bookings line. From an internal versus external perspective, in the construction side of the business, so that will show up in Buildings and Infrastructure. There, I would attribute some more of the bookings growth to internal execution because that's where we have the initial launches with our new digital tools and the Trimble Construction One offering that we have the slide on. So that is where we could actually see a lift in the bookings, and I would call that internal execution of an offering that's there to meet the market demand for it.  So I'd say most of it is, I would say, external facing and then there's certainly an aspect of internal. And that gives me confidence because we're in early days of our digital systems enabling us to launch these bundled solutions. So I'm bullish on this portfolio. Jonathan, it's Rob. So the slide showed Trimble Construction One contractor offering. It's a persona-based offering. What will come next is an architecture and design persona offering and owner persona offering. Within that contractor offering, the early signs we're seeing and we saw it in Q1 play through for us as is we saw really double-digit growth in cross -- what we call cross-sell bookings where we could see the velocity of bookings increased from that offering. We saw our win rates go up significantly. We saw the deal sizes be higher. We saw the sales cycles be lower. And all of that drove bookings up. So Jonathan, for us it's a really good sign that we're on a good path here. We haven't seen any discernible signs of cancellation in the backlog, Jonathan. So -- and hey, looking from the competitive market standpoint, it's not like there's many places to go. I mean everyone has a supply chain challenge to work through. But I think the real story is it's the efficacy of the value proposition you get from Trimble technology is what's making the backlogs sticky. It's Rob. So first, I'd shout out to all of our colleagues in Geospatial. They just continued a terrific run in the business. I'll give you a few comments. First, on the innovation side, and this is where the team deserves a lot of credit. So the number of new product introductions has really helped our global distribution channel be able to message out into the market. So whether it's a tilt compensation on our GNSS products. Laser scanner has been doing quite well for us. Mobile mapping business has been doing well, so has monitoring business unit.  At an end market level where we've seen strengths are in Departments of Transportation. So I think infrastructure, think defense actually is also doing reasonably well. The net of all of that is we believe we're gaining market share in the business. And then I'd complement that by also talking about the go-to-market side, and the team has done a really nice job of working with our global dealer channel to drive the business forward. Well, from a percent of the business, okay, the divestitures alone, you can think of that as 350 plus or minus basis points increase in the mix. In other words, more software mix. The thing that's always difficult with the percentages, Kristen, is if the hardware business continues to do well, and I think it will on the heels of coming infrastructure spend, we would expect that to benefit our hardware businesses, especially in the engineering and construction side of Trimble. So that, by the math, I think that, that would throttle that increased expansion in the percent of software. And ultimately, obviously, we take the dollars to the bank, not the percentages.  If I were to say all things equal, what we've seen over a long baseline now is our recurring revenue is growing faster than our perpetual. It's been growing faster than our hardware. So take that baseline and if we're already in the now post divestiture in the high 50% of that mix, that's naturally moving towards a 60 -- 6 in front of it, so 60-plus percent. When you look at the growth in ARR, David mentioned raising our view on ARR during the year. And so -- and then that's before any, let's say, impact of future acquisitions and how that may further the mix. So 6, in front of it is where it's trending. And as we move towards Investor Day, I think we can sharpen the pencil on that.  Your other question around operating leverage. I mean, certainly, it's our long-term view as you get through model transitions that the nature of the gross margins in the business and a recurring revenue business and software business for that matter are such that we should be able to increase the operating leverage over time. So our historical baseline has been plus or minus 25%, and that looks like something heading towards a 30%, something with a 3 in front of it is where we think about the long-term model, Kristen. I think there's a little bit of a mixed story on that, Rob. We've certainly seen some areas of the portfolio where production is increasing, and we're seeing our business increase. And then I've seen others where it remains a bit challenged. So I have to say it's a little bit of a mixed view, not a totally consistent view. My read-through of OEM reports this quarter suggests that they're seeing tight supply chains as well for the rest of the year.  And as you know, we primarily orient ourselves around the aftermarket and serving the mixed fleet. And what we're seeing in the aftermarket is continued strong uptake and adoption of the technology, and that really is the growth catalyst for the business. Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. Yes. No, it's a good question. So it may give you a historical comparison on the business mix and why we see our portfolio today being so much more resilient than in the past. And I'll give you a comparison of 2012 to our 2021 numbers. In 2012, the percent recurring revenue we had was about 18%. And in 2021, it was 34% of our business, and that correlates to that $1.47 billion of ARR that we exited Q1 with. Overall, software and services were 32% of our revenue in 2012, 55% at the end of 2021. If we look at the operating income in 2012, 76% of our operating income came from 2 of the segments, Geospatial and Resources and Utilities, and that was 53% in 2021.  So the message is the portfolio has become much more balanced across the end markets that we serve over the last years, much more software-centric, much more recurring within that. So that gives us visibility and predictability into the model looking forward. If I look at the -- you asked about Buildings and Infrastructure in particular, that is a business that's absolutely transformed over the last 10 years. Today, that's approaching 3/4 of our segment and software today in Buildings and Infrastructure, and that would have been almost entirely hardware if you go back to the past.  And then when we've looked at a baseline as well over time of how we've performed in times of recession or difficult economic environments, we only have a small number of years where we've ever actually have seen revenue go down in time. We were, in that first COVID in 2020, we were down about 4% in revenue. We look back to the financial crisis, we look back to 9/11, we look back to the commodity price collapse. There's just 4 years we can look back to where we ever had a revenue decline. And so I mapped that against what today is a much stronger and more resilient business model. And that's what gives us -- it's one of the many things that gives us confidence and conviction to continue to invest in our business. ARR growth in the mid- to upper teens in those businesses. The Viewpoint business, I know we had a record first quarter bookings. We look at the intersection of -- actually look at the Viewpoint business specifically, the Trimble Construction One Contractor Cloud, our Viewpoint business is a major component of that offering. And so a good amount of the cross-sell sales that we produced or booked in the first quarter were a result of that part of the portfolio. So we continue to see really good things out of those businesses. We continue to see customers who are asking us to connect the data flows that we have resident in the contractor management system, which is what the Viewpoint business provides to be able to connect that to what's happening in the field, to be able to connect that to subcontractor systems.  What we see on the e-Builder side of the business, which is really serving capital program management for owners of the construction projects. We increasingly have customers who are also using our Cityworks software for enterprise asset management. And now with our recent acquisition of AgileAssets, think about the operational maintenance phase, work and the management of that. We have customers who are asking us to integrate the data and the workflow between these packages. So it really, from my perspective, is confirming that we're on the right path with Connect and Scale and our industry platform strategy. It's Rob. Let's just start at Europe. Europe growth in the quarter was 14%. That would have been higher yet, because that haircut's for FX. So in the high teens growth rate. So demonstrable, let's say, evidence that Europe produced in the quarter, and that was reasonably broad-based across all of our segments. Let's talk about Russia and Belarus, Ukraine and the dynamic and I'll focus first really on Russia, Belarus. So yes, at this point, we don't anticipate the revenue coming back. That business is largely agriculture and geospatial oriented. So now let's talk about the agriculture aspect of that business. Yes, the fact of the matter is that 13% of the world's calorie production is now off of the market. The fact of the matter is that with the fertilizer that comes out of that region. And now I'd say the lack of fertilizer are coming out of that region, you would expect to see lower yields around -- of crop around the world.  That does provide the backdrop for what we see in commodity prices. Look at corn around 8, soy over 16. That food is going to be -- need to be produced somewhere. It doesn't happen overnight as we know. There's obviously a growing cycle to that. We would look at market. So I think about Brazil, I think about Canada, I do think about North America, Australia. And as we have a global footprint, we certainly turn our attention -- incrementally turn our attention to those markets.  Now in the short term, the reality is that we have a lot of backlog in our agriculture business. And so in the short term, and I'll define short term as 2022, we don't see a material change to our revenue because we can direct that backlog elsewhere. It's really looking forward after that.  And then if I take Ukraine specifically, we are doing everything we can to help our dealers in the region, it's really inspiring to see a number of our employees and partners continuing to find a way to actually make some of the business go. And so we'll do everything we can to help our customers and partners and the people in that region. And let's hope that, that crop can come back online before too long."

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer of Trimble, you may begin your conference.\nRob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before we get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which refer to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. Strategic progression takes place as a series of a thousand little steps, periodically punctuated by non-linear moves and events. Reflecting on the quarter and the year, 2023 represented a transformative year for Trimble. Within the portfolio, the Transporeon acquisition and the announcement of the agriculture joint venture with AGCO represent two of the larger moves in the history of our company. Reflecting on our Connect & Scale strategy over a five-year timeframe, the structural improvement in the business is self-evident and is the result of methodical work over the last few years by our colleagues and partners. Annualized recurring revenue finished 2023 at a record $1.98 billion, up 13% organically, and represents the single biggest lever we have to increase shareholder value. This compares with ARR of $1.1 billion five years ago. Recurring revenue was 49% of our total revenue in 2023 and 53% in the fourth quarter versus 31% in 2018. Remaining performance obligations closed the year at $1.8 billion. Gross margin closed at a record 64.7% in 2023, up 470 basis points over 2022. This compares to 58% five years ago. This is definitive structural improvement. EBITDA margin closed at a record 26.6% for the year. In dollars, we crossed the threshold of $1 billion of EBITDA. This compares to EBITDA of 22.6% five years ago. Operating leverage has been 44% over a five-year timeframe. We are running with negative working capital, and we closed with free cash flow of $555 million, up 60% over prior year. Our ARR and low capital intensity punctuate the difference between industrial technology and industrial. While the evolution of our financial metrics during our transformation have been compelling, the bigger takeaway is how this positions the company today for success now and in the future. Trimble has never been in a better position to help our customers succeed with solutions that address the growing intersection of the physical and digital worlds. We are eager to leverage our strong market position and unique assets to drive continued profitable growth in software and technology-enabled services, to expand margins and to showcase our ability to increase the company's overall returns through smart capital allocation. We believe this framework is the winning formula for a world-class industrial technology company, and we believe executing against this plan will allow Trimble to unlock and sustainably compound value for shareholders. With that structural context, let's turn to Slide 3 and talk about our three-fold framework that guides our capital allocation priorities looking back on 2023 and forward into 2024. First, we remain committed to executing our Connect & Scale strategy. Over the last several years, our P&L investments have been heavily biased towards our software assets in architecture, engineering, construction and owners, which we refer to as AECO. This focus is driven by the size and immediacy of the secular opportunity. Our transformation of AECO software represents the tip of the spear for the company and increasingly provides a template for how we will operate across all of Trimble. Looking at tactical proof points of progression, let's start with our product strategy. Trimble Construction One, or TC1, can be thought of as a commercial framework around pre-packaged bundled offerings. In the fourth quarter, we doubled the number of these pre-packaged offerings by serving more users across more vertical segments. Nearly half of our AECO bookings in the fourth quarter were TC1 bookings. We come into 2024 with a strong portfolio, and we will learn, adapt and expand these offerings. As we connect more of our data and workflows, we will continue to expand these offerings, powered by the investments we have been making in our underlying systems and enhanced by our process transformation. After a couple of years of hard work, we can now see a 360-degree view of our customer set, which unlocks marketing and selling insights to enhance our go-to-market motion with more advanced marketing and selling strategies that are more efficient and cost effective. We will continue to roll-out functionality in 2024 and we will expand the capabilities across more geographies and more of the product portfolio. And it goes further, because product, systems and process work have to link to an aligned go-to-market organization in order to turn possibility into a reality. As measured by cross-sell activity, more than 20% of 2023 annualized contract value, or ACV, bookings in AECO were cross-sell bookings. In the fourth quarter, this number accelerated to over 25%. This didn't happen by accident. The acceleration comes from a packaging of solutions across business lines and is enabled by our digital transformation. We are winning on the breadth of capability. To put this into further context, the AECO teams delivered over 30% ACV bookings growth in 2023 and had a record fourth quarter. Slide 4 shows a number of quotes from our customers, who've continued to give us positive feedback about our direction. We are delivering lifecycle value and uniquely connecting workflows, all while making ourselves easier to do business with. As we come into 2024, we are moving towards an account-based selling model, which will further align ourselves to sell TC1 and cross-sell offerings. This capital allocation is working, and is built on our strategy around the construction continuum that has been accelerated by successful M&A over the last 10 years. Back to Slide 3, the second of our three capital allocation priorities is to further simplify and focus our business. In the last four years, we have divested 21 businesses that did not meet the must-have threshold of a connect and scale business, namely the ability to further a connected industry solution while delivering compelling and sustainable financial results. In early 2024, we divested a small water metering business and a steeler business that we owned in Germany. We continue to look for areas where we can further simplify our portfolio, which goes beyond divestitures. We have reduced thousands of SKUs in the last couple of years and turned a number of standalone products into features within larger bundled solutions. In September, we announced our joint venture with AGCO, which naturally led us to rethink how we organize ourselves, which in turn unlocked an ability for us to further simplify and focus our teams. In the second half of 2023, we undertook $50 million of run rate cost reductions, $10 million ahead of our commitment in November, recognizing that we needed to say no to more things so that we could further focus on the organization. Given the pending AGCO JV and the new organizational structure that officially went into effect in January, we reorganized the business under three pillars: AECO, Field Systems and Transportation and Logistics. This structure brings similar businesses together, enhancing our ability to achieve scale and growth. The new organization in place is already off to a good start, and hats off to the team for executing these changes seamlessly. Beginning with the first quarter, we will naturally re-segment our reporting results to reflect the way we view our business. And when we do this, we will simultaneously be able to deliver an increased level of clarity on our business models that many of you have been seeking. Slide 5 provides an overview of the direction we are going with these three segments, while providing a bit of color on the software and recurring revenue centricity of each segment. Returning again to Slide 3, let's talk about the third of our three capital allocation priorities, which is return the capital to shareholders. In September, when we announced the JV, we communicated our plan to pay down debt and return capital to shareholders via a buyback. In the fourth quarter, we executed $100 million of buyback. On January 30, our Board approved a new buyback authorization of $800 million, replacing the remaining authority under the prior plan. We reiterated our intention to pay down $1.1 billion of debt and communicated that our near-term intentions on M&A are to focus on tuck-in opportunities. These capital allocation priorities sit against the backdrop of our day-to-day execution. They also sit within a context of what we are seeing in our end markets across the global economy. Geographically speaking, North America has been overall healthy. Europe remains quite challenged. The agriculture and transportation markets face macro headwinds, a result of commodity prices and overcapacity in trucking. The engineering and construction markets have proved to be more resilient, with puts and takes across sub-segments. Control what we control is the operating theme in place. We deliver an enduring value proposition in the form of productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. Record bookings in parts of the business such as AECO software and Transporeon, demonstrate the durability of the business. David, over to you.\nDavid Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Slides 6, 7 and 8 cover the financial highlights for the quarter and the year. Organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter was plus 3% and for the year was plus 1%. Excluding the agriculture business, growth was 6% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the year. Standout metrics for 2023 include a 470 basis point improvement in gross margin and $555 million in free cash flow, enabled by profit growth and the success of our efforts to bring inventory levels down. With net debt at $2.8 billion, we remain ahead of the deleverage plan we put in place at the time of the Transporeon acquisition. We have paid down $268 million of the debt incurred to finance the deal. We ended the year with net leverage of 2.8 times, only modestly above our long-range target of 2.5 times. The JV with AGCO is pending regulatory approval, and we continue to expect that the transaction will close in the first half of this year. For modeling purposes, we have assumed that the deal closes early in the second quarter. With debt paydown following the AGCO JV transaction close, our leverage will be below 2 times. Slide 9 covers revenue trends by geography and business model. $1.98 billion of ARR is the standout highlight, up 24% year-on-year and up 13% on an organic basis. Product revenues, which are non-recurring and predominantly our bundled hardware and perpetual software, were down 3% year-on-year. Excluding agriculture, product revenues were down less than 1%, reflecting the stabilization of these businesses now that dealer inventories have come well down from their peak in early 2022. Dealer inventories are now broadly in line with dealers' business outlook, and our sales trends going forward are expected to track underlying demand trends. By geography, growth in North America reflects the relative strength that Rob referenced earlier. APAC revenues were strong, driven by growth in Australia and India. Revenues were down organically in Europe, reflecting challenging macroeconomic conditions across many the end markets we serve there. Slide 10 breaks down performance at the segment level. In Buildings and Infrastructure, the highlight in the quarter was the strong performance of our recurring revenue offerings. Bookings in our AECO software businesses increased over 30% year-on-year, driven in part by the strong cross-sell and TC1 performance, which Rob mentioned earlier. Aided by the bookings performance, segment ARR grew year-on-year by just under 20%, with net retention over 110%, and at the highest levels this business has seen. Segment revenues of non-recurring offerings, principally machine control for civil construction customers, were relatively flat year-on-year, resulting in total segment revenue up organically by 10%. Segment margins were up by 290 basis points year-on-year, driven both by fixed cost leverage and by the mix shift toward higher margin software offerings. In Geospatial, revenues grew organically by 1%. Our && revenue in this segment breaks down across three broad categories: field sales to end users, government business, and OEM business. Sales of our core survey and mapping products to end users returned to meaningful growth in the quarter, reflecting a healthier state of dealer inventories and improving underlying market conditions. Offsetting the strong end user growth, component sales to OEMs were down as we lapped some unusually large shipments a year ago. Segment margins were up by 180 basis points, driven principally by lower component input costs versus year-ago levels. In Resources and Utilities, organic revenue for the quarter was down year-on-year by 4%. Excluding sales of products to agriculture customers, Resources and Utilities revenues were up by approximately 10%. Segment operating margins were lower year-on-year by 160 basis points, driven principally by lower revenue. In Transportation, revenue was up 1% organically. Segment organic ARR was up mid-single digit as growth in our transportation enterprise software and MAPS businesses offset the anticipated impact of churn in our North American mobility offerings. Transporeon remains an inorganic comparison, and the highlight in the quarter for Transporeon was achieving a record level of bookings, up over 20% versus prior year. We were encouraged by the sales performance of the team in light of the difficult macro dynamics in Transporeon's core European market. Segment margins increased year-on-year by 610 basis points, reflecting the higher margins of Transporeon and margin progression in the balance of the segment. Let's move now to 2024 guidance on Slide 11. I will focus on our performance, excluding our Agriculture business and including on a go-forward basis, our more limited exposure to Ag, as a 15% owner of the JV and a supplier of products to the JV. For the sake of completeness, we show on Page 11, two views: a reported view with the Ag business included through the first quarter of 2024; and an as-adjusted view without the agriculture business, which will ultimately be operated within the JV. The outlook for ARR growth remains strong, driven by momentum across our AECO software businesses. We expect full year organic growth rates in the 11% to 13% range, off our year-end 2023 levels of $1.98 billion. As-adjusted organic revenues are expected to grow for the year in the 4% to 7% range. Please note that our fiscal 2024 will include 53 weeks, and the extra week will increase full year and fourth quarter revenues by approximately $85 million. On an as-adjusted basis, we expect margins to improve, with EBITDA margins between 26.5% and 27.5%. This represents margin improvement year-on-year of between 100 basis points and 200 basis points. The margin improvement will come from a combination of improved software mix and the impact of the cost actions we took coming out of 2023. From a cash flow perspective, we expect full year cash flow of approximately 0.85 times non-GAAP net income. Excluding the costs relating to our AGCO JV transaction and the impact of the 53rd week, free cash flow is estimated to be approximately equal to non-GAAP net income. Our base cash flow forecast assumes no change in tax legislation. A bill moving through the U.S. Congress will, if enacted, restore the immediate expensing of R&D for tax purposes. If passed, this legislation would improve incrementally our cash outlook for 2024 by approximately $130 million. Our EPS forecast for the year reflects the beneficial impact of our planned deleveraging following the close of the AGCO JV and up to $800 million of share repurchase. We expect EPS for the year in the range of $2.60 to $2.80. I'll finish by offering a few comments on how our guidance for 2024 breaks out by quarter and by segment. We expect organic revenue growth to be strongest in Buildings and Infrastructure. Software businesses in Buildings and Infrastructure are expected to grow in the mid to high teens with product-related businesses up slightly, leading to organic revenue growth for the full year of between 11% and 13%. Buildings and Infrastructure organic growth includes approximately $70 million from the 53rd week. We plan to accelerate model conversions from perpetual to subscription software, tied with hardware in our civil construction business. Geospatial revenue is expected to be down slightly on an organic basis, with growth in field sales and survey offset by lower sales to U.S. federal customers where business tends to be lumpy from year-to-year. We will also accelerate model conversions from perpetual to subscription software in our survey and mapping business. Resources and Utilities as-adjusted organic growth will be up in the high-single digits, led primarily by continued growth in our positioning services business. Transportation revenues are expected to be up in the mid-single digits for the year and relatively flat on an organic basis, with growth in Transporeon offset by lower North American mobility revenue. We expect reduced hardware revenue in mobility, as we are intentionally pivoting that business away from lower-margin hardware sales to OEMs, instead focusing on the higher value-added data flows. From an operating margin perspective, we expect to grow margins year-over-year in the Buildings and Infrastructure and Resources and Utilities segments. Transportation margins will be up slightly, while Geospatial segment margins are expected to be down year-over-year due to changes in customer and product mix. For the first quarter, let's turn to Slide 12 for additional color. On an as-adjusted basis, we expect organic growth between 2% and 6%, and EBITDA margin between 26% and 27%. Buildings and Infrastructure is expected to drive most of the organic growth in the first quarter, with low-single digit growth in Geospatial. As-adjusted Resources and Utilities is expected to post high-single digit revenue growth in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we expect to see softness in Ag. Weakness in the global ag market is certainly a factor, but the bigger driver is the expected impact of the transition in our distribution strategy. Transportation revenues in the quarter are expected to be down modestly on an organic basis. Overall, we expect sequential improvement in Transportation segment organic growth rates as the year progresses, driven by gradually improving end market conditions and the inclusion of Transporeon in our organic trends, beginning in the second quarter. As Rob mentioned earlier, we are moving to implement a new segment reporting structure that reflects our updated organization and the way we will evaluate our businesses and allocate capital going forward. Our plan is to publish more details on our new segment reporting structure later in the first quarter, with financials going back two years and the perspective on how our 2024 annual guidance cascades to the new segments. We will have a separate conference call with investors to review that information when it is available. Rob, I'll turn it back over to you.\nRob Painter: Thanks, David. We were busy in the fourth quarter preparing ourselves to come into 2024 with a running start. We were with over 10,000 customers at Trimble user conferences in September, October and November. We recommitted to our capital allocation priorities, undertook cost reduction, prepared to reorganize the company and made our numbers for the quarter. We plan to host an Investor Day later in the year to discuss the evolution of the business and to provide investors with more financial detail, including updated targets. I will end by taking a moment to welcome Ron Nersesian and Kara Sprague to the Trimble Board, two fantastic additions. Operator, we can now open the line to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kristen Owen from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nKristen Owen: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to start with maybe the Q1 guides. It sounds like there's some moving pieces in there. And when I look at this outline that you provided on Slide 12, it looks like Ag is really the driver between the revenue growth numbers there and maybe what we would have expected. So, if you could help us just understand what the underlying growth in the JV assets looks like in the Q1? And just any other moving parts that we should be considering for the 1Q guidance? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Good morning, Kristen. This is Rob, and thanks for the question. So, coming into Q1 and thinking about the guide at the company level, what I would want you to hear is the momentum we have with the ARR and the overall business and the stabilization of the supply chains throughout most of the hardware businesses, which reflects in the total year guide. With respect to the first quarter specifically within the current Resources and Utilities segment, some of this is a quarterization topic, and then when we double click within that, within the Ag business specifically, there's two dynamics to consider: one is, at the overall market level, so call it market sentiment; and then the other is, within the transition of the relationship. So, at the overall Ag market level, you can see that from some of the market statistics from farmer sentiment in the U.S. and Europe, and what we've seen from some of the OEM posts on their numbers and unit expectations coming into the year. So that's part of the topic. And then, the other one is called more the aftermarket side. We're in the transition with the prior corporate relationship we've had and into the new JV relationship. And in that time of transition, there's a natural gap. And so, we never expected, as we've been making this distribution transition, that it was going to be a perfectly linear transition. So, we really think about it at the annual level, not at just a quarter-to-quarter comparison to really track the progress. So, the work is well underway from the integration planning between the teams, from signing up dealers in the aftermarket. So, before you get that revenue in the aftermarket, we've got to be signing up the dealers. And so, it's like comparative to looking at bookings and software business that you got to get the booking before you get the ARR. So, I hope that color helps you, Kristen.\nKristen Owen: Yeah, thanks for that, Rob. The other question that I have is a little bit longer term sort of post this AGCO JV. When we look at some of the momentum that you outlined, particularly around like the TC1 platform, how do you use that as a framework in some of the other areas of the business going forward? If you can outline any areas where maybe you're seeing growth with existing customers, how that's driving that cross-sell revenue? And as you go through these model transitions in some of the field services business, how you can use the success that you've seen in TC1 in those areas?\nRob Painter: Yeah. I'm glad you asked that question, because the work that we're doing around TC1 and currently within the B&I segment, soon to be, you'll hear me talking about it with AECO moving forward, architects, engineers, construction and owners, and the digital transformation work that we've been undertaking, people, process, systems work over these last few years, it's really been vastly proportionate to this construction -- overall construction software part of the business. And really, we see it as the template for the rest of the company. We see it as the tip of the spear. There's a lot of work that's gone into it. There's also a lot of learnings that have come along with it, and I mean that in a very good way. The success of what we see in those bookings is demonstrable proof-point, that the strategy works. So, as we think about taking that into other parts of the business and we look forward, let's say, into the future field systems part of the company, what we saw is -- in the quarter is, that we're growing ARR at a double-digit clip in those businesses. And so, we can already take some of the ideas and frameworks around TC1 into other parts of the business. For example, bundling of our correction services -- positioning services with the hardware products that we have. We've been undergoing some model transitions in some of the hardware businesses, where we can separate value between the underlying hardware and then have a subscription or a term license on top of that. So, it's a -- there are things that happen in parallel. It's not perfectly serial, but for sure on the AECO software side of the business, that is a great template for us, and it has certainly been working so far.\nKristen Owen: Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nRob Painter: Hi, Jerry.\nDavid Barnes: Good morning.\nJerry Revich: Rob, why don't we just talk about, given the organizational change, obviously you laid out the restructuring savings and opportunities, can you comment on just beyond restructuring? How has the P&L responsibility shifted at all? It sounds like there are more changes beyond just cost savings. I'm wondering, if you could just expand on that. You alluded to cutting back, I think, on some lower ROI projects. Can you just talk more about the opportunities of the realignment beyond cost savings?\nRob Painter: Sure, Jerry. Thanks for the question. I'll give you a couple examples. At the AECO leadership, Mark Schwartz is looking after that segment for us now. And at the field systems level, Ron Bisio is looking after that. So, two examples of where we reoriented leaders. Ron's history is long -- baseline history of Trimble is within our hardware businesses and dealer channel expertise. And so, we have all of that consolidated under Ron now, across all the hardware-centric businesses we have. Mark Schwartz has spent the bulk of his Trimble career in that AECO software space, and has just done a terrific job picking up the baton here and taking the business forward. And actually under his leadership, the growth has been accelerating in the business. So that's on the people side of the realignment. A couple of examples on the cost side. Jerry, we took a couple of lenses to this. One was we looked at some bigger areas where we saw that the revenue potential was pushing out from more near to mid term to mid to long term. So, Autonomy is an example of that, where we took, I'd say, a bigger chunk view of -- a realignment view on that, and did a reprioritization of capital allocation. The other one was a fair amount of the cloud investments we were making, platform investments we were doing at the corporate level, and what we decided to do was move those closer to the coalface, closer to the business, so it manifested -- given that AECO is the tip of the spear for the transformation work, move that closer to the AECO leadership, where you have to make those capital allocation trade-offs. They are closer to the coalface. And what I see is some organizational efficiency that comes out of that. So, those are a couple examples on the cost side, when we really took a look at saying, how do we get simpler? How do we get more focused? We've got to execute at a sharper clip. And I think Q4 was evidence that those moves are working, and as we come into Q1 and come into 2024, I'm confident that we've got the right org in place working on the right things.\nJerry Revich: Thank you, Rob. And separately, can I trouble you folks just to flesh out the performance of Transporeon for us? Exiting the fourth quarter, what was organic growth, logo growth, retention rates? You mentioned bookings were good. Can you just expand on some of the quantitative numbers on the performance entering '24?\nRob Painter: Sure. Happy to do that. So just as a reminder, that business model is mostly a transaction model, a consumption model. And so, let's say, at the macro level, the European -- and it's still predominantly European-centric business. The economy hasn't improved. I think, we understand that about Europe when I say that, so that's a headwind to some of the transactions, and there's less spot as compared to contract, which is unfavorable to the business model. Within that, though, we think about control what we can control. So, I'll give you some numbers. Gross retention in the business is essentially 100%. I exclude Russia, where we elected not to do some business, and to get out of that business in Russia, ARR in the high-single digits, operating margins above 20%, and at the deal model level that we had, which means the team is doing a good job working the cost line. The fourth quarter itself was a record bookings in the company's history. At new product introduction level, we have new products such as autonomous procurement, which are driving that book -- part of the reason that's driving that bookings growth beyond the value proposition that we already delivered to the customers. And at a product integration level, our global teams are working together to come to a single -- just one single feature for real-time visibility, bringing the MAPS technology, we already had at Trimble, into the Transporeon business, for example. So those are a few statistics, quantitative and qualitative for you, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ho: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on your thoughts around, I guess, the macroenvironment as it relates to your guidance and the potential impact to, I guess, the organic growth outlook as you start to look to next year?\nRob Painter: Hey, Jonathan. Good morning. It's Rob. On the macro outlook, well, I'll start with North America -- geographically, North America is the strongest of the overall geographies. Europe is still a challenge, and I think will remain a challenge throughout 2024. So, those are the two major geos that impact the overall business, I would say. Asia Pacific feels a little bit more steady as she goes within that context. Within the vertical markets, in construction, it won't surprise you that we overall see strength in subsegments such as infrastructure, renewables, data centers, reshoring, onshoring drive positive momentum for the bookings. Residential remains more challenged on a global level, and worse so in Europe. The freight markets which would impact our Transportation business, those remained quite challenged, I'd say -- I'd really say globally on that. I commented already on Agriculture, and we see those macros challenged a little bit more globally as well. The thing I would overlay on top of that, Jonathan, as we think about coming into 2024 is, just how structurally different our business is as compared to the Trimble of old. And so, I think it's instructive to think about that $1.98 billion of ARR that we closed the year with. And by the way, that's the way we do that calculation. It's averaged across the fourth quarter. So, if you took really the contracted ARR, what we ended with, that would even be higher. So, we woke up on January 1st with that visibility and predictability into the business. We know from the bookings that we closed the fourth quarter with, how that helps accelerate that growth coming in. So, I think it's an important overlay when we look at the business model. And on one axis -- a business models on one axis, and then the overlay of the geographic and end market segments on the other axis to come to a point of view on the macros that support our view on the guide for the year.\nJonathan Ho: Excellent. And just as a follow up, can you maybe help us understand where we are in terms of the distribution partnership realignment? And what does the opportunity look like just given the divestiture coming up and just the changing nature of your positioning within the space? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Jonathan, do you specifically mean Agriculture? Or do you mean distribution realignment across all of Trimble?\nJonathan Ho: The Agriculture segment of it.\nRob Painter: Okay. All right, from -- okay. So, from the realignment on a distribution, there's a few levers there that we work. One is with the C&H aftermarket dealers themselves, and we continue to be able to sign those up as what we refer to internally as retail outlets that work alongside our full-line vantage dealers. So, the sign-ups of the dealers, I'd say, that goes according to plan. And then, with the AGCO realignment coming in with that, I'd say in addition to that, that's been part of the integration planning work that we've got with the team, and we've got a clear line of sight now to how we're going to work with those new partners coming into the mix. So, in terms of the planning work, I would say it's well underway and it's what we need to do to get the business off to the start, we would like to see it get off to.\nJonathan Ho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria: Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much. So, at the last Investor Day, I think you had a slide, you expected about 20% of revenues transacted through the connected digital platform by 2023, and that would go up to 70% by 2024 and 90% by 2025. I know, you're hosting another Analyst Day probably this year. So, where are you in that journey now in terms of getting revenues through that platform?\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Tami, it's David Barnes. One thing I'll say, just as context, is digital transformations and big process and system projects are really hard, and our experience is no different. We ended 2023 with about 15% of our revenue going through the new digital platform, that's principally the North American AECO software businesses. We've been rethinking the scope and focus of our next phase of digital transformation. We'll go from 15% to probably closer to 35% here in early 2024, and that involves bringing more of our businesses. So, including the e-Builder and Cityworks suites, and then expanding the AECO effort all over the globe. We're right now in the process of rethinking how our digital platform interacts best with our hardware businesses and with transportation. So, I'll be -- I'll hold-off in giving a forecast on how we go from 35% to more of the business. I think, we have a more informed and smarter approach now, and we're rethinking our priorities.\nRob Painter: And those priorities, if I can add to that to build on David's comment, is for sure to continue on the software businesses as the priority for the work.\nDavid Barnes: Yeah, that's right. Rob said in his commentary earlier that the AECO business is the tip of the spear. It's where we see the highest, most direct early returns through the digital transformation and TC1 and selling bundles. So, that's where our focus is at the moment.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, David and Rob. The second question I have is, I just wanted to understand the operating margin guidance for this year better. I think, excluding the Ag JV, it seems like you expect about 80 basis points to 180 basis points of operating margin improvement this year. What is really -- what are the building blocks of that? How do you really get there? And also, what is the impact of that 53rd week, if any at all, on that margin guide?\nRob Painter: Tami, I'll start -- this is Rob. I'll start with giving you perspective, and then let's have David build on that. I'll start at the structural level of the company, ending the year at 64.7% gross margin compared to 58% from just five years ago. We look at the operating leverage, we've driven over that five-year timeframe, is at 44%. We talked about the bookings progression in Q4, that adds to the ARR, and that contracted ARR that we would have ended the year with coming into the year. So, at a structural level, the baseline of the business is poised to be able to increase the level of gross margin as we continue to grow the business. And you would see in the web tables the difference between the gross margins at the product level versus at the gross -- product level versus the subscription and software businesses, and just how much higher the gross margin is in the software-centric businesses. So, from a straight mix perspective alone, you drive gross margin up. And I'm talking about that structural gross margin because that is a primary driver of what can enable us to drive that operating margin expansion. We also talked about the costs management in the prepared remarks, which is another side of the equation. And David, do you want to build on that?\nDavid Barnes: Yeah. So, as Rob said, structurally, our recurring revenue businesses are higher gross margin, you can see from disclosure, it's about 80% gross margin on the recurring revenue streams versus about 50% on the product stream. So, a lot of the roughly 100 basis point to 200 basis point margin improvement become -- flows directly from the ongoing mix shift of the business. With regard to the 53rd week, we quantified that that'll have about an $85 million revenue benefit for the year, all in the last quarter. The one thing I'll say though, is that's not the only discreet factor that's impacting our business. As I mentioned in my remarks, our business with big government customers, particularly the U.S. federal government, is lumpy from year-to-year. We talked about that as being a good factor earlier in 2023. So, that'll work against us. And then, we're doing model conversions focused on the software that's bundled with hardware. So, if you actually take the change in the federal business and the impact of the model conversions added to the 53rd week, they roughly offset each other. So, my way of looking at the underlying growth momentum of the business, I would say the 53rd week is a positive. Those other factors offset that positive and they're relatively neutral.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you so much.\nDavid Barnes: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Good morning, Rob. Good morning, David. This is actually [Devin] (ph) on for Jason today. Thanks for taking our questions. I want to start with the construction software business. Nice to hear bookings growth exiting at more than 30% over there. Really strong results. Maybe looking at 2024, seems like macro could be improving and TC1 really seeing strong traction there. How are you kind of thinking about bookings growth to trend for 2024 and any additional maybe puts and takes you can kind of give us on how the different sub-product group would kind of perform for the year?\nRob Painter: Devin. Hey, good morning. This is Rob. Let me give you my perspective and thoughts on the bookings opportunity we have within the AECO software business. And this is a business now that comes into the year with, call it, in the range of $1 billion of ARR to start with, so of the company's, call it, $2 billion of ARR. So, we're talking some law of large numbers to continue to grow at that double-digit ARR clip, and we have to continue to be able to book at a healthy level. And all of 2023 was evidence of that, and accelerated even into the fourth quarter of 2023. So, we come in with some momentum and confidence around that. The color I'd like to put around that with Trimble Construction One is that it unlocks the cross-sell and up-sell by putting in place a framework that allows our customers to easily scale with us, that in turn unlocks our bundles and the offerings that meet the customers' needs. And so, that then creates an environment where inside the company, we're working together to help scale a customer's usage of our products with a lot less friction that they would have had in the past. And we're seeing faster times to close deals. We're seeing a greater share of wallet share captured when a new logo enters our ecosystem. And one of the things we said in the prepared remarks was that our TC1 agreements have now accelerated to make up 50% of the bookings that we had in the fourth quarter. And those agreements are the basis that powers that cross-sell penetration and that made up 25% of the fourth quarter bookings that we had. Coming into 2024, we'll continue to expand TC1 by rolling it out to more regions, for example, Asia-Pacific, and we'll roll it out into more of the portfolio. For example, that's the \"O\" and the AECO. So, we play those factors forward. We've got a belief set that we can continue to grow those bookings in the AECO space at a quite healthy double-digit level.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. No, that's very helpful color. And then, just a quick follow-up on TC1. It seems like things are really picking up over there. I want to ask, are you still mainly seeing adoptions among existing customers that are opting for TC1? Or are you seeing more new customers kind of adopting that product? And then, in terms of kind of the ASP opportunity, are you still kind of seeing the 2 to 3 times uplift that you kind of highlighted at your Analyst Day from TC1?\nRob Painter: Yeah. Good question, Devin. So, there is both, it's existing customers and new customers. At the existing customers, for sure, and call it in the construction ERP space, those are uplifts that we've continued to drive, the conversions from on-prem to the cloud. And as you make that transition from on-prem to the cloud, doing more than just a lift and shift actually changing the nature of the offering. And it's not just a pricing mechanism, it's a value-based mechanism because then you can get access to the broader array of what we have to offer our customers. We do continue to see a healthy uplift when we make those conversions above a 2x rate. And then, on the new logos, well actually within -- it's sort of a blur between existing customers and new customers. What we can see from the cross-sell data is that the customers who still predominantly are buying one or two solutions from us are picking up that third, fourth, fifth, depending on the nature of the exact bundle that they're buying from us. And then on a straight new logo basis, we are certainly continuing to see wins from new customers. So really, it's all of the above answer. When you have new customers, of course, there's not an uplift in the equation. It's all straight new revenue.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for all the details.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nChad Dillard: Hi. Good morning, guys. So, I wanted to go back to your question about the adjusted operating margins, and I was hoping you could bridge from '23 to '24. Just trying to understand like the moving parts of cost savings mix, operating leverage and more specifically, the impact of the AG divestiture.\nDavid Barnes: Okay. Let me start with the last point. So, when we announced the Ag deal, we said that the impact on a '23 pro forma basis of the divestiture of Ag was about 70 basis points negative to operating margins, so that's where we started, and you can see the '24 outlook in our as-adjusted table. The principal drivers from there, as I mentioned earlier, we're planning on an as-adjusted basis, i.e., without the Ag business in the base, 100 basis points to 200 basis points of margin improvement. One way to think of that, Chad, is essentially all of it is in the gross margin improvement, which is a natural impact of mix. If you drill down a little more, we do have the benefit of cost reduction, but we are adding resources where it's driving growth. In fact, all or slightly more than all of our year-on-year OpEx is in our AECO business, where we had over 30% bookings growth, and we have about 20% ARR growth, we are really allocating our operating capital to pour the coal on that on that business. So, you can think of it as taking the cost reductions we've taken and reallocating it to the highest-return, highest-growth business.\nRob Painter: And if I can build on David's comment, which is exactly right, in that capital allocation call. So, the capital allocation call within the P&L to continue to put that go-to-market OpEx into the AECO space. One of the things I should have said in the response to one of Devin's questions was when we look at the net retention ratio, we're near 110% in the AECO part of the business. It's a terrific, terrific outcome that the team is driving. We look for -- what's an instructive measurement for us is looking at the customer lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition costs. And what that data is telling us is that we're well above three on that is -- that tells us that is a place to continue to put OpEx into. You don't get an ROI on that OpEx in year one. So there's, call it, a trade-off there is that we're playing the long-term game to continue to fuel that bookings growth, which will generate long-term sustainable ARR growth, and of course, overall revenue growth.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And then, just on the segment reorg, can you talk about the impact on your distribution in go-to-market? Just trying to understand like the operational changes here. I guess like what you can do better now versus before under the old structure?\nRob Painter: Yeah, Chad, I'm glad you asked that, and that's a good question. And let's take the what we are calling field systems now. So think of that as the -- in the old segmentation, the Geospatial businesses that we have, predominantly the one you'll know the best is survey, and then we have the machine control business that distributes through our SITECH that traditionally have gone through the B&I segment. So those come together under Field Systems, Ron Bisio is looking after that. I'll give you a demonstrable evidence of a change that we already made. We have one person responsible for sales now for all the Field Systems. One in APAC, one in the Americas, and one in Europe, Middle East and Africa. So, one person in each to call that three. And that would have been six people, because we would have had that duplicated just a few months ago. What that does, beyond just driving some -- just efficiencies that you could expect, it actually also allows us to rethink the allocation of how we use resources. That frees up some capability for us to put time and effort and money and people into ongoing dealer development. So, beyond the chase, the short to mid term numbers is actually having resources that can help our dealers think about a long term business. In some cases, Chad, we have dealers who cover multiple businesses for Trimble. Some do both civil and survey, some do ag and survey, some do ag and survey and civil. And with one set of eyes or one set of accountability overall of those is we can make more cogent decisions about how we make natural trade-offs that will happen between the portfolios. If I look at the product -- that's the go-to-market. If I look at the product side, what it unlocks is, I'd say, more efficiency in how we think about measuring the hardware SKUs that we have. Over the last few years, we've reduced the SKUs by 10% in the company. That drives simplification and underlying systems. We have one view on our GNSS portfolio, for example, that goes across the business, one point of view now on the total stations and the scanners that can be used across multiple parts of the portfolio. So, I think it drives just a lot sharper portfolio thinking when we look at it at the product lens. So, we put that product lens together with a go-to-market lens, and I think that positions us well. I think, this is -- I think, it was time to do it, and the announcement of the JV gave us a reason to really rethink how we did things and to move fast to put it in place. And the teams, they did all the planning work in the fourth quarter and they've come out of the gate, I'd say, quite strong here as a team, as an aligned team with a defined set of OKRs, objectives and key results, that we've defined by each of these major businesses.\nChad Dillard: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Tilton: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. In the prepared remarks, you guys talked about being open to continuing to divest certain aspects of the business. When you look across your three new reporting segments, where do you see the most opportunity to maybe divest over the next 12 months and continue to simplify the portfolio?\nRob Painter: Well, good morning. Hey, thanks for the question. This is Rob, I'll give you the lens I have on it. I think about two axes on this one. One axis is the financial profile of the business, call it, the -- yes, there's a short-term view on the profile and then there's a long-term profile view on a business. And can it meet the expectation of returns that we have, whether it's return on invested capital or accretion at an ARR growth or at an EBITDA level. On the other axis, we'll look at the strategic attractiveness of that. That could involve the competitive position, but it also looks a lot at an individual businesses or product, let's say, capability to make the whole stronger. And if something sits on its own and isn't making the whole of the business stronger, so it doesn't contribute to a stronger Transportation business or a stronger Construction business, then it's not in the -- let's say, in the favorable side -- it's on a less favorable side of my 2x2 that I'm laying out, and the financial one speaks for itself on that 2x2. So, if I look and apply it against the portfolio, one of the things, if I take Field Systems as an example, within that, going back to the financial crisis back in 2008, there was a time when we had to step in and be the ballast for some of the dealers at the company. And we came in and we acquired a few of the dealers. But we're not ultimately long-term the best owners of a distribution business. We really think that belongs with entrepreneurs out in the field, very, very local businesses. So that would be an example of the divestiture we talked about here in just actually the last few weeks, as an example. So, we would look for parts of the business like that, that really we don't see ourselves as the best owner. So, I'll comment there as opposed to specifics within each of the businesses. But I think we can demonstrably say that we've had the courage to take a look in the mirror, as evidenced by 21 of the divestitures in the last few years driving this simplification and this focus, because we think that that drives the efficiency and the output and the outcomes for the company.\nJoshua Tilton: Very helpful. And then, it also sounds like we're going to get a little more color around the '24 guidance in context of these new reporting segments when you give us that additional disclosure. But maybe if I just step back and take a little bit longer view, like how do you guys think or how should investors think about the different growth rates across those three segments over the next, call it, three to five years?\nRob Painter: Yeah. So I'm going to stay pretty high level on that because, I think, it'll be more appropriate to take that view when we do the next Investor Day. On the slide, I think it's Slide 5 in the presentation that was attached to the prepared remarks, we did give a sizing of AECO Field Systems and Transportation and Logistics, sizing from a view, and it's plus or minus on the revenue for 2024, and maybe more instructively, at the -- with the software breakdown and the recurring revenue breakdown within each of those segments that we'll have. What I can say on top of that, at company level and what we've talked about in the past is we think we can continue to drive the double-digit level of growth of the annualized recurring revenue. And so, that's number one or two on the top strategic priorities I've got for the company. Field Systems makes up the hardware businesses. That's one, I think is instructive to look back to 2019. And if you look at that longitudinal growth of the CAGR over that timeframe, it is in the range of what we have put forward at prior Investor Days in terms of, call it, at a four to 6%, depending on which part of the business, the survey business we've historically talked about at 4% to 6% level, with some of the other hardware being a little bit higher. But that's what compromises that. So you could look at that past data and I think that 2019 to 2023, or you could extend it into 2024 view, fits within the range. We've got that. And obviously, it's been up or down and the standard deviations have been high within a quarter-to-quarter view. That's why we think it's instructed to look at a long baseline view. And then, you'd come to the Transportation business and what's new of course, since the last time we would have done in -- an analyst model or an Investor Day, would have been the addition of Transporeon into the portfolio. So, I'll give you that view to start with, and let's stay tuned. But maybe one thing that's -- an additional thing I'll say that could be interesting is when we last did the Investor Day, we said by -- if you did the math by 2027, that we would be a 60% recurring revenue business. And if you take David's prepared remarks and guide at a pro forma level, we think we'll be there in 2024. I'll leave you with that.\nJoshua Tilton: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRob Wertheimer: Yes. Hi. So, I wanted to ask two on the Transportation market, if I may, and you touched on this earlier, Rob, on Transporeon, where you had a good bookings quarter in the midst of, I assume, a pretty weak European market. So, any further commentary on what you changed there, or if anything changed to drive that growth? And given that business is levered to spot transactions and rates, any insight as to what the sustainable growth might be when that market comes back? And then just the second question will be simply on the idea of de-emphasizing hardware sales to OEMs in Transportation, and focusing on the flow of data. Is there any strategic link there? Do you get less flow of data if you don't have as much in the field on devices? And could you just talk around that issue? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Yeah, Rob, thanks for the question. So, let's take them in order with the bookings growth in the fourth quarter, and what is still a difficult market overlay. I think it demonstrates the value proposition that the technology provides, and I had a chance to go to our customer conference in Barcelona in September, and what you see in a room like that, and what you can see on the PowerPoint slides are some of the very largest logos in the world who use our Transporeon technology. It's really quite impressive, whether it's retail or CPG, or packaging or building construction materials. When you look through the different verticals, it's really an impressive array of companies and a difficult market environment while companies can be reluctant to either spend the money or to spend the organizational effort to make a change, to do something different, the fact of the matter is that we can drive efficiencies and productivities -- productivity into our customers. What we see is that our win rates are as high as they've ever been. And so to us, that's an important factor in how we think about the business. And the control of what you can control, and not losing market share is an important metric. And we think that the bookings, while they're less than we would like on an overall annualized basis, I'll be clear on that, within what we've got, that they are showing that we're holding, if not gaining share in the market. So, I do have my gratitude to the team for delivering that and fighting it out every day. And you asked about the spot contract mix and what could that look like on the other side. It's like I heard Jamie Dimon, when asked what's the definition of a recession, he said, it's something that happens every seven years. So, take some version of that quote. If it was actually true, take some version of that quote. We know that the freight markets go up and down. So, the market will -- and it does show signs of having stabilized. Now stabilized is different from increasing. What we can see over a long baseline is that the business out of freight recessions has accelerated strongly coming out of that. And it makes sense, and it's a consumption-based model, is that we would expect if the market inflects, and I'm not making a call that it will inflect in 2024, to be clear, as it inflects, the business just naturally can significantly increase the level of revenue that comes through. And I'd say at a strong double-digit level is what I would expect that to move to. And then, last you asked about at the OEM level and the de-emphasizing of the hardware. I'd say the hardware in the Transportation segment is quite different than the hardware around the rest of Trimble. There is less differentiation in that onboard compute, and these days even more of our own in call them, in-cab hardware devices are close to commercial off the shelf tablets. So, making our own hardware years ago was a unique, differentiated factor and it seamlessly integrated into our full software offering, and you are kind of like one throat to choke, offer the full solution. As that technology landscape changed, it's just not a great place to be. We refer to it internally as the lower calorie -- low-calorie revenue, because there's just not attractive margins or [indiscernible] margins with all of the hardware. Not all of the hardware is equal, but at that OEM level, if OEM wants to value engineer the lowest cost hardware, it's just not a place, I think we're going to ever be the best doing that at some kind of global scale. Thus, looking at the data integration. When we look at the data, OEMs have one set of data that they're interested in, which is frankly different than what customers are interested in to run their businesses. That is to say that data on machine health is extraordinarily valuable to the OEMs. And by the way, it is important to customers, but it usually comes to customer service agreements, whereas customers operate mixed fleets of equipment and the customers are trying to drive their own productivity and efficiency and safety and visibility, and to operate within whatever installed base of technology that they've got. And so, we think that data feed will continue to be necessary both at the -- for the OEM level, but also you need to be able to provide a gateway, so to speak, to be able to bring the customers on to a more fully functional, in this case, telematic solution. And by the way, whether that's Trimble or not Trimble solutions, I think that would be true for the market to have that flexibility. So Rob, I hope that helps provide some color.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining us today. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before we get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which refer to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. Strategic progression takes place as a series of a thousand little steps, periodically punctuated by non-linear moves and events. Reflecting on the quarter and the year, 2023 represented a transformative year for Trimble. Within the portfolio, the Transporeon acquisition and the announcement of the agriculture joint venture with AGCO represent two of the larger moves in the history of our company. Reflecting on our Connect & Scale strategy over a five-year timeframe, the structural improvement in the business is self-evident and is the result of methodical work over the last few years by our colleagues and partners. Annualized recurring revenue finished 2023 at a record $1.98 billion, up 13% organically, and represents the single biggest lever we have to increase shareholder value. This compares with ARR of $1.1 billion five years ago. Recurring revenue was 49% of our total revenue in 2023 and 53% in the fourth quarter versus 31% in 2018. Remaining performance obligations closed the year at $1.8 billion. Gross margin closed at a record 64.7% in 2023, up 470 basis points over 2022. This compares to 58% five years ago. This is definitive structural improvement. EBITDA margin closed at a record 26.6% for the year. In dollars, we crossed the threshold of $1 billion of EBITDA. This compares to EBITDA of 22.6% five years ago. Operating leverage has been 44% over a five-year timeframe. We are running with negative working capital, and we closed with free cash flow of $555 million, up 60% over prior year. Our ARR and low capital intensity punctuate the difference between industrial technology and industrial. While the evolution of our financial metrics during our transformation have been compelling, the bigger takeaway is how this positions the company today for success now and in the future. Trimble has never been in a better position to help our customers succeed with solutions that address the growing intersection of the physical and digital worlds. We are eager to leverage our strong market position and unique assets to drive continued profitable growth in software and technology-enabled services, to expand margins and to showcase our ability to increase the company's overall returns through smart capital allocation. We believe this framework is the winning formula for a world-class industrial technology company, and we believe executing against this plan will allow Trimble to unlock and sustainably compound value for shareholders. With that structural context, let's turn to Slide 3 and talk about our three-fold framework that guides our capital allocation priorities looking back on 2023 and forward into 2024. First, we remain committed to executing our Connect & Scale strategy. Over the last several years, our P&L investments have been heavily biased towards our software assets in architecture, engineering, construction and owners, which we refer to as AECO. This focus is driven by the size and immediacy of the secular opportunity. Our transformation of AECO software represents the tip of the spear for the company and increasingly provides a template for how we will operate across all of Trimble. Looking at tactical proof points of progression, let's start with our product strategy. Trimble Construction One, or TC1, can be thought of as a commercial framework around pre-packaged bundled offerings. In the fourth quarter, we doubled the number of these pre-packaged offerings by serving more users across more vertical segments. Nearly half of our AECO bookings in the fourth quarter were TC1 bookings. We come into 2024 with a strong portfolio, and we will learn, adapt and expand these offerings. As we connect more of our data and workflows, we will continue to expand these offerings, powered by the investments we have been making in our underlying systems and enhanced by our process transformation. After a couple of years of hard work, we can now see a 360-degree view of our customer set, which unlocks marketing and selling insights to enhance our go-to-market motion with more advanced marketing and selling strategies that are more efficient and cost effective. We will continue to roll-out functionality in 2024 and we will expand the capabilities across more geographies and more of the product portfolio. And it goes further, because product, systems and process work have to link to an aligned go-to-market organization in order to turn possibility into a reality. As measured by cross-sell activity, more than 20% of 2023 annualized contract value, or ACV, bookings in AECO were cross-sell bookings. In the fourth quarter, this number accelerated to over 25%. This didn't happen by accident. The acceleration comes from a packaging of solutions across business lines and is enabled by our digital transformation. We are winning on the breadth of capability. To put this into further context, the AECO teams delivered over 30% ACV bookings growth in 2023 and had a record fourth quarter. Slide 4 shows a number of quotes from our customers, who've continued to give us positive feedback about our direction. We are delivering lifecycle value and uniquely connecting workflows, all while making ourselves easier to do business with. As we come into 2024, we are moving towards an account-based selling model, which will further align ourselves to sell TC1 and cross-sell offerings. This capital allocation is working, and is built on our strategy around the construction continuum that has been accelerated by successful M&A over the last 10 years. Back to Slide 3, the second of our three capital allocation priorities is to further simplify and focus our business. In the last four years, we have divested 21 businesses that did not meet the must-have threshold of a connect and scale business, namely the ability to further a connected industry solution while delivering compelling and sustainable financial results. In early 2024, we divested a small water metering business and a steeler business that we owned in Germany. We continue to look for areas where we can further simplify our portfolio, which goes beyond divestitures. We have reduced thousands of SKUs in the last couple of years and turned a number of standalone products into features within larger bundled solutions. In September, we announced our joint venture with AGCO, which naturally led us to rethink how we organize ourselves, which in turn unlocked an ability for us to further simplify and focus our teams. In the second half of 2023, we undertook $50 million of run rate cost reductions, $10 million ahead of our commitment in November, recognizing that we needed to say no to more things so that we could further focus on the organization. Given the pending AGCO JV and the new organizational structure that officially went into effect in January, we reorganized the business under three pillars: AECO, Field Systems and Transportation and Logistics. This structure brings similar businesses together, enhancing our ability to achieve scale and growth. The new organization in place is already off to a good start, and hats off to the team for executing these changes seamlessly. Beginning with the first quarter, we will naturally re-segment our reporting results to reflect the way we view our business. And when we do this, we will simultaneously be able to deliver an increased level of clarity on our business models that many of you have been seeking. Slide 5 provides an overview of the direction we are going with these three segments, while providing a bit of color on the software and recurring revenue centricity of each segment. Returning again to Slide 3, let's talk about the third of our three capital allocation priorities, which is return the capital to shareholders. In September, when we announced the JV, we communicated our plan to pay down debt and return capital to shareholders via a buyback. In the fourth quarter, we executed $100 million of buyback. On January 30, our Board approved a new buyback authorization of $800 million, replacing the remaining authority under the prior plan. We reiterated our intention to pay down $1.1 billion of debt and communicated that our near-term intentions on M&A are to focus on tuck-in opportunities. These capital allocation priorities sit against the backdrop of our day-to-day execution. They also sit within a context of what we are seeing in our end markets across the global economy. Geographically speaking, North America has been overall healthy. Europe remains quite challenged. The agriculture and transportation markets face macro headwinds, a result of commodity prices and overcapacity in trucking. The engineering and construction markets have proved to be more resilient, with puts and takes across sub-segments. Control what we control is the operating theme in place. We deliver an enduring value proposition in the form of productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. Record bookings in parts of the business such as AECO software and Transporeon, demonstrate the durability of the business. David, over to you. Thanks, David. We were busy in the fourth quarter preparing ourselves to come into 2024 with a running start. We were with over 10,000 customers at Trimble user conferences in September, October and November. We recommitted to our capital allocation priorities, undertook cost reduction, prepared to reorganize the company and made our numbers for the quarter. We plan to host an Investor Day later in the year to discuss the evolution of the business and to provide investors with more financial detail, including updated targets. I will end by taking a moment to welcome Ron Nersesian and Kara Sprague to the Trimble Board, two fantastic additions. Operator, we can now open the line to questions. Good morning, Kristen. This is Rob, and thanks for the question. So, coming into Q1 and thinking about the guide at the company level, what I would want you to hear is the momentum we have with the ARR and the overall business and the stabilization of the supply chains throughout most of the hardware businesses, which reflects in the total year guide. With respect to the first quarter specifically within the current Resources and Utilities segment, some of this is a quarterization topic, and then when we double click within that, within the Ag business specifically, there's two dynamics to consider: one is, at the overall market level, so call it market sentiment; and then the other is, within the transition of the relationship. So, at the overall Ag market level, you can see that from some of the market statistics from farmer sentiment in the U.S. and Europe, and what we've seen from some of the OEM posts on their numbers and unit expectations coming into the year. So that's part of the topic. And then, the other one is called more the aftermarket side. We're in the transition with the prior corporate relationship we've had and into the new JV relationship. And in that time of transition, there's a natural gap. And so, we never expected, as we've been making this distribution transition, that it was going to be a perfectly linear transition. So, we really think about it at the annual level, not at just a quarter-to-quarter comparison to really track the progress. So, the work is well underway from the integration planning between the teams, from signing up dealers in the aftermarket. So, before you get that revenue in the aftermarket, we've got to be signing up the dealers. And so, it's like comparative to looking at bookings and software business that you got to get the booking before you get the ARR. So, I hope that color helps you, Kristen. Yeah. I'm glad you asked that question, because the work that we're doing around TC1 and currently within the B&I segment, soon to be, you'll hear me talking about it with AECO moving forward, architects, engineers, construction and owners, and the digital transformation work that we've been undertaking, people, process, systems work over these last few years, it's really been vastly proportionate to this construction -- overall construction software part of the business. And really, we see it as the template for the rest of the company. We see it as the tip of the spear. There's a lot of work that's gone into it. There's also a lot of learnings that have come along with it, and I mean that in a very good way. The success of what we see in those bookings is demonstrable proof-point, that the strategy works. So, as we think about taking that into other parts of the business and we look forward, let's say, into the future field systems part of the company, what we saw is -- in the quarter is, that we're growing ARR at a double-digit clip in those businesses. And so, we can already take some of the ideas and frameworks around TC1 into other parts of the business. For example, bundling of our correction services -- positioning services with the hardware products that we have. We've been undergoing some model transitions in some of the hardware businesses, where we can separate value between the underlying hardware and then have a subscription or a term license on top of that. So, it's a -- there are things that happen in parallel. It's not perfectly serial, but for sure on the AECO software side of the business, that is a great template for us, and it has certainly been working so far. Hi, Jerry. Sure, Jerry. Thanks for the question. I'll give you a couple examples. At the AECO leadership, Mark Schwartz is looking after that segment for us now. And at the field systems level, Ron Bisio is looking after that. So, two examples of where we reoriented leaders. Ron's history is long -- baseline history of Trimble is within our hardware businesses and dealer channel expertise. And so, we have all of that consolidated under Ron now, across all the hardware-centric businesses we have. Mark Schwartz has spent the bulk of his Trimble career in that AECO software space, and has just done a terrific job picking up the baton here and taking the business forward. And actually under his leadership, the growth has been accelerating in the business. So that's on the people side of the realignment. A couple of examples on the cost side. Jerry, we took a couple of lenses to this. One was we looked at some bigger areas where we saw that the revenue potential was pushing out from more near to mid term to mid to long term. So, Autonomy is an example of that, where we took, I'd say, a bigger chunk view of -- a realignment view on that, and did a reprioritization of capital allocation. The other one was a fair amount of the cloud investments we were making, platform investments we were doing at the corporate level, and what we decided to do was move those closer to the coalface, closer to the business, so it manifested -- given that AECO is the tip of the spear for the transformation work, move that closer to the AECO leadership, where you have to make those capital allocation trade-offs. They are closer to the coalface. And what I see is some organizational efficiency that comes out of that. So, those are a couple examples on the cost side, when we really took a look at saying, how do we get simpler? How do we get more focused? We've got to execute at a sharper clip. And I think Q4 was evidence that those moves are working, and as we come into Q1 and come into 2024, I'm confident that we've got the right org in place working on the right things. Sure. Happy to do that. So just as a reminder, that business model is mostly a transaction model, a consumption model. And so, let's say, at the macro level, the European -- and it's still predominantly European-centric business. The economy hasn't improved. I think, we understand that about Europe when I say that, so that's a headwind to some of the transactions, and there's less spot as compared to contract, which is unfavorable to the business model. Within that, though, we think about control what we can control. So, I'll give you some numbers. Gross retention in the business is essentially 100%. I exclude Russia, where we elected not to do some business, and to get out of that business in Russia, ARR in the high-single digits, operating margins above 20%, and at the deal model level that we had, which means the team is doing a good job working the cost line. The fourth quarter itself was a record bookings in the company's history. At new product introduction level, we have new products such as autonomous procurement, which are driving that book -- part of the reason that's driving that bookings growth beyond the value proposition that we already delivered to the customers. And at a product integration level, our global teams are working together to come to a single -- just one single feature for real-time visibility, bringing the MAPS technology, we already had at Trimble, into the Transporeon business, for example. So those are a few statistics, quantitative and qualitative for you, Jerry. Hey, Jonathan. Good morning. It's Rob. On the macro outlook, well, I'll start with North America -- geographically, North America is the strongest of the overall geographies. Europe is still a challenge, and I think will remain a challenge throughout 2024. So, those are the two major geos that impact the overall business, I would say. Asia Pacific feels a little bit more steady as she goes within that context. Within the vertical markets, in construction, it won't surprise you that we overall see strength in subsegments such as infrastructure, renewables, data centers, reshoring, onshoring drive positive momentum for the bookings. Residential remains more challenged on a global level, and worse so in Europe. The freight markets which would impact our Transportation business, those remained quite challenged, I'd say -- I'd really say globally on that. I commented already on Agriculture, and we see those macros challenged a little bit more globally as well. The thing I would overlay on top of that, Jonathan, as we think about coming into 2024 is, just how structurally different our business is as compared to the Trimble of old. And so, I think it's instructive to think about that $1.98 billion of ARR that we closed the year with. And by the way, that's the way we do that calculation. It's averaged across the fourth quarter. So, if you took really the contracted ARR, what we ended with, that would even be higher. So, we woke up on January 1st with that visibility and predictability into the business. We know from the bookings that we closed the fourth quarter with, how that helps accelerate that growth coming in. So, I think it's an important overlay when we look at the business model. And on one axis -- a business models on one axis, and then the overlay of the geographic and end market segments on the other axis to come to a point of view on the macros that support our view on the guide for the year. Jonathan, do you specifically mean Agriculture? Or do you mean distribution realignment across all of Trimble? Okay. All right, from -- okay. So, from the realignment on a distribution, there's a few levers there that we work. One is with the C&H aftermarket dealers themselves, and we continue to be able to sign those up as what we refer to internally as retail outlets that work alongside our full-line vantage dealers. So, the sign-ups of the dealers, I'd say, that goes according to plan. And then, with the AGCO realignment coming in with that, I'd say in addition to that, that's been part of the integration planning work that we've got with the team, and we've got a clear line of sight now to how we're going to work with those new partners coming into the mix. So, in terms of the planning work, I would say it's well underway and it's what we need to do to get the business off to the start, we would like to see it get off to. And those priorities, if I can add to that to build on David's comment, is for sure to continue on the software businesses as the priority for the work. Tami, I'll start -- this is Rob. I'll start with giving you perspective, and then let's have David build on that. I'll start at the structural level of the company, ending the year at 64.7% gross margin compared to 58% from just five years ago. We look at the operating leverage, we've driven over that five-year timeframe, is at 44%. We talked about the bookings progression in Q4, that adds to the ARR, and that contracted ARR that we would have ended the year with coming into the year. So, at a structural level, the baseline of the business is poised to be able to increase the level of gross margin as we continue to grow the business. And you would see in the web tables the difference between the gross margins at the product level versus at the gross -- product level versus the subscription and software businesses, and just how much higher the gross margin is in the software-centric businesses. So, from a straight mix perspective alone, you drive gross margin up. And I'm talking about that structural gross margin because that is a primary driver of what can enable us to drive that operating margin expansion. We also talked about the costs management in the prepared remarks, which is another side of the equation. And David, do you want to build on that? Devin. Hey, good morning. This is Rob. Let me give you my perspective and thoughts on the bookings opportunity we have within the AECO software business. And this is a business now that comes into the year with, call it, in the range of $1 billion of ARR to start with, so of the company's, call it, $2 billion of ARR. So, we're talking some law of large numbers to continue to grow at that double-digit ARR clip, and we have to continue to be able to book at a healthy level. And all of 2023 was evidence of that, and accelerated even into the fourth quarter of 2023. So, we come in with some momentum and confidence around that. The color I'd like to put around that with Trimble Construction One is that it unlocks the cross-sell and up-sell by putting in place a framework that allows our customers to easily scale with us, that in turn unlocks our bundles and the offerings that meet the customers' needs. And so, that then creates an environment where inside the company, we're working together to help scale a customer's usage of our products with a lot less friction that they would have had in the past. And we're seeing faster times to close deals. We're seeing a greater share of wallet share captured when a new logo enters our ecosystem. And one of the things we said in the prepared remarks was that our TC1 agreements have now accelerated to make up 50% of the bookings that we had in the fourth quarter. And those agreements are the basis that powers that cross-sell penetration and that made up 25% of the fourth quarter bookings that we had. Coming into 2024, we'll continue to expand TC1 by rolling it out to more regions, for example, Asia-Pacific, and we'll roll it out into more of the portfolio. For example, that's the \"O\" and the AECO. So, we play those factors forward. We've got a belief set that we can continue to grow those bookings in the AECO space at a quite healthy double-digit level. Yeah. Good question, Devin. So, there is both, it's existing customers and new customers. At the existing customers, for sure, and call it in the construction ERP space, those are uplifts that we've continued to drive, the conversions from on-prem to the cloud. And as you make that transition from on-prem to the cloud, doing more than just a lift and shift actually changing the nature of the offering. And it's not just a pricing mechanism, it's a value-based mechanism because then you can get access to the broader array of what we have to offer our customers. We do continue to see a healthy uplift when we make those conversions above a 2x rate. And then, on the new logos, well actually within -- it's sort of a blur between existing customers and new customers. What we can see from the cross-sell data is that the customers who still predominantly are buying one or two solutions from us are picking up that third, fourth, fifth, depending on the nature of the exact bundle that they're buying from us. And then on a straight new logo basis, we are certainly continuing to see wins from new customers. So really, it's all of the above answer. When you have new customers, of course, there's not an uplift in the equation. It's all straight new revenue. And if I can build on David's comment, which is exactly right, in that capital allocation call. So, the capital allocation call within the P&L to continue to put that go-to-market OpEx into the AECO space. One of the things I should have said in the response to one of Devin's questions was when we look at the net retention ratio, we're near 110% in the AECO part of the business. It's a terrific, terrific outcome that the team is driving. We look for -- what's an instructive measurement for us is looking at the customer lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition costs. And what that data is telling us is that we're well above three on that is -- that tells us that is a place to continue to put OpEx into. You don't get an ROI on that OpEx in year one. So there's, call it, a trade-off there is that we're playing the long-term game to continue to fuel that bookings growth, which will generate long-term sustainable ARR growth, and of course, overall revenue growth. Yeah, Chad, I'm glad you asked that, and that's a good question. And let's take the what we are calling field systems now. So think of that as the -- in the old segmentation, the Geospatial businesses that we have, predominantly the one you'll know the best is survey, and then we have the machine control business that distributes through our SITECH that traditionally have gone through the B&I segment. So those come together under Field Systems, Ron Bisio is looking after that. I'll give you a demonstrable evidence of a change that we already made. We have one person responsible for sales now for all the Field Systems. One in APAC, one in the Americas, and one in Europe, Middle East and Africa. So, one person in each to call that three. And that would have been six people, because we would have had that duplicated just a few months ago. What that does, beyond just driving some -- just efficiencies that you could expect, it actually also allows us to rethink the allocation of how we use resources. That frees up some capability for us to put time and effort and money and people into ongoing dealer development. So, beyond the chase, the short to mid term numbers is actually having resources that can help our dealers think about a long term business. In some cases, Chad, we have dealers who cover multiple businesses for Trimble. Some do both civil and survey, some do ag and survey, some do ag and survey and civil. And with one set of eyes or one set of accountability overall of those is we can make more cogent decisions about how we make natural trade-offs that will happen between the portfolios. If I look at the product -- that's the go-to-market. If I look at the product side, what it unlocks is, I'd say, more efficiency in how we think about measuring the hardware SKUs that we have. Over the last few years, we've reduced the SKUs by 10% in the company. That drives simplification and underlying systems. We have one view on our GNSS portfolio, for example, that goes across the business, one point of view now on the total stations and the scanners that can be used across multiple parts of the portfolio. So, I think it drives just a lot sharper portfolio thinking when we look at it at the product lens. So, we put that product lens together with a go-to-market lens, and I think that positions us well. I think, this is -- I think, it was time to do it, and the announcement of the JV gave us a reason to really rethink how we did things and to move fast to put it in place. And the teams, they did all the planning work in the fourth quarter and they've come out of the gate, I'd say, quite strong here as a team, as an aligned team with a defined set of OKRs, objectives and key results, that we've defined by each of these major businesses. Well, good morning. Hey, thanks for the question. This is Rob, I'll give you the lens I have on it. I think about two axes on this one. One axis is the financial profile of the business, call it, the -- yes, there's a short-term view on the profile and then there's a long-term profile view on a business. And can it meet the expectation of returns that we have, whether it's return on invested capital or accretion at an ARR growth or at an EBITDA level. On the other axis, we'll look at the strategic attractiveness of that. That could involve the competitive position, but it also looks a lot at an individual businesses or product, let's say, capability to make the whole stronger. And if something sits on its own and isn't making the whole of the business stronger, so it doesn't contribute to a stronger Transportation business or a stronger Construction business, then it's not in the -- let's say, in the favorable side -- it's on a less favorable side of my 2x2 that I'm laying out, and the financial one speaks for itself on that 2x2. So, if I look and apply it against the portfolio, one of the things, if I take Field Systems as an example, within that, going back to the financial crisis back in 2008, there was a time when we had to step in and be the ballast for some of the dealers at the company. And we came in and we acquired a few of the dealers. But we're not ultimately long-term the best owners of a distribution business. We really think that belongs with entrepreneurs out in the field, very, very local businesses. So that would be an example of the divestiture we talked about here in just actually the last few weeks, as an example. So, we would look for parts of the business like that, that really we don't see ourselves as the best owner. So, I'll comment there as opposed to specifics within each of the businesses. But I think we can demonstrably say that we've had the courage to take a look in the mirror, as evidenced by 21 of the divestitures in the last few years driving this simplification and this focus, because we think that that drives the efficiency and the output and the outcomes for the company. Yeah. So I'm going to stay pretty high level on that because, I think, it'll be more appropriate to take that view when we do the next Investor Day. On the slide, I think it's Slide 5 in the presentation that was attached to the prepared remarks, we did give a sizing of AECO Field Systems and Transportation and Logistics, sizing from a view, and it's plus or minus on the revenue for 2024, and maybe more instructively, at the -- with the software breakdown and the recurring revenue breakdown within each of those segments that we'll have. What I can say on top of that, at company level and what we've talked about in the past is we think we can continue to drive the double-digit level of growth of the annualized recurring revenue. And so, that's number one or two on the top strategic priorities I've got for the company. Field Systems makes up the hardware businesses. That's one, I think is instructive to look back to 2019. And if you look at that longitudinal growth of the CAGR over that timeframe, it is in the range of what we have put forward at prior Investor Days in terms of, call it, at a four to 6%, depending on which part of the business, the survey business we've historically talked about at 4% to 6% level, with some of the other hardware being a little bit higher. But that's what compromises that. So you could look at that past data and I think that 2019 to 2023, or you could extend it into 2024 view, fits within the range. We've got that. And obviously, it's been up or down and the standard deviations have been high within a quarter-to-quarter view. That's why we think it's instructed to look at a long baseline view. And then, you'd come to the Transportation business and what's new of course, since the last time we would have done in -- an analyst model or an Investor Day, would have been the addition of Transporeon into the portfolio. So, I'll give you that view to start with, and let's stay tuned. But maybe one thing that's -- an additional thing I'll say that could be interesting is when we last did the Investor Day, we said by -- if you did the math by 2027, that we would be a 60% recurring revenue business. And if you take David's prepared remarks and guide at a pro forma level, we think we'll be there in 2024. I'll leave you with that. Yeah, Rob, thanks for the question. So, let's take them in order with the bookings growth in the fourth quarter, and what is still a difficult market overlay. I think it demonstrates the value proposition that the technology provides, and I had a chance to go to our customer conference in Barcelona in September, and what you see in a room like that, and what you can see on the PowerPoint slides are some of the very largest logos in the world who use our Transporeon technology. It's really quite impressive, whether it's retail or CPG, or packaging or building construction materials. When you look through the different verticals, it's really an impressive array of companies and a difficult market environment while companies can be reluctant to either spend the money or to spend the organizational effort to make a change, to do something different, the fact of the matter is that we can drive efficiencies and productivities -- productivity into our customers. What we see is that our win rates are as high as they've ever been. And so to us, that's an important factor in how we think about the business. And the control of what you can control, and not losing market share is an important metric. And we think that the bookings, while they're less than we would like on an overall annualized basis, I'll be clear on that, within what we've got, that they are showing that we're holding, if not gaining share in the market. So, I do have my gratitude to the team for delivering that and fighting it out every day. And you asked about the spot contract mix and what could that look like on the other side. It's like I heard Jamie Dimon, when asked what's the definition of a recession, he said, it's something that happens every seven years. So, take some version of that quote. If it was actually true, take some version of that quote. We know that the freight markets go up and down. So, the market will -- and it does show signs of having stabilized. Now stabilized is different from increasing. What we can see over a long baseline is that the business out of freight recessions has accelerated strongly coming out of that. And it makes sense, and it's a consumption-based model, is that we would expect if the market inflects, and I'm not making a call that it will inflect in 2024, to be clear, as it inflects, the business just naturally can significantly increase the level of revenue that comes through. And I'd say at a strong double-digit level is what I would expect that to move to. And then, last you asked about at the OEM level and the de-emphasizing of the hardware. I'd say the hardware in the Transportation segment is quite different than the hardware around the rest of Trimble. There is less differentiation in that onboard compute, and these days even more of our own in call them, in-cab hardware devices are close to commercial off the shelf tablets. So, making our own hardware years ago was a unique, differentiated factor and it seamlessly integrated into our full software offering, and you are kind of like one throat to choke, offer the full solution. As that technology landscape changed, it's just not a great place to be. We refer to it internally as the lower calorie -- low-calorie revenue, because there's just not attractive margins or [indiscernible] margins with all of the hardware. Not all of the hardware is equal, but at that OEM level, if OEM wants to value engineer the lowest cost hardware, it's just not a place, I think we're going to ever be the best doing that at some kind of global scale. Thus, looking at the data integration. When we look at the data, OEMs have one set of data that they're interested in, which is frankly different than what customers are interested in to run their businesses. That is to say that data on machine health is extraordinarily valuable to the OEMs. And by the way, it is important to customers, but it usually comes to customer service agreements, whereas customers operate mixed fleets of equipment and the customers are trying to drive their own productivity and efficiency and safety and visibility, and to operate within whatever installed base of technology that they've got. And so, we think that data feed will continue to be necessary both at the -- for the OEM level, but also you need to be able to provide a gateway, so to speak, to be able to bring the customers on to a more fully functional, in this case, telematic solution. And by the way, whether that's Trimble or not Trimble solutions, I think that would be true for the market to have that flexibility. So Rob, I hope that helps provide some color."

            "name": "David Barnes",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Slides 6, 7 and 8 cover the financial highlights for the quarter and the year. Organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter was plus 3% and for the year was plus 1%. Excluding the agriculture business, growth was 6% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the year. Standout metrics for 2023 include a 470 basis point improvement in gross margin and $555 million in free cash flow, enabled by profit growth and the success of our efforts to bring inventory levels down. With net debt at $2.8 billion, we remain ahead of the deleverage plan we put in place at the time of the Transporeon acquisition. We have paid down $268 million of the debt incurred to finance the deal. We ended the year with net leverage of 2.8 times, only modestly above our long-range target of 2.5 times. The JV with AGCO is pending regulatory approval, and we continue to expect that the transaction will close in the first half of this year. For modeling purposes, we have assumed that the deal closes early in the second quarter. With debt paydown following the AGCO JV transaction close, our leverage will be below 2 times. Slide 9 covers revenue trends by geography and business model. $1.98 billion of ARR is the standout highlight, up 24% year-on-year and up 13% on an organic basis. Product revenues, which are non-recurring and predominantly our bundled hardware and perpetual software, were down 3% year-on-year. Excluding agriculture, product revenues were down less than 1%, reflecting the stabilization of these businesses now that dealer inventories have come well down from their peak in early 2022. Dealer inventories are now broadly in line with dealers' business outlook, and our sales trends going forward are expected to track underlying demand trends. By geography, growth in North America reflects the relative strength that Rob referenced earlier. APAC revenues were strong, driven by growth in Australia and India. Revenues were down organically in Europe, reflecting challenging macroeconomic conditions across many the end markets we serve there. Slide 10 breaks down performance at the segment level. In Buildings and Infrastructure, the highlight in the quarter was the strong performance of our recurring revenue offerings. Bookings in our AECO software businesses increased over 30% year-on-year, driven in part by the strong cross-sell and TC1 performance, which Rob mentioned earlier. Aided by the bookings performance, segment ARR grew year-on-year by just under 20%, with net retention over 110%, and at the highest levels this business has seen. Segment revenues of non-recurring offerings, principally machine control for civil construction customers, were relatively flat year-on-year, resulting in total segment revenue up organically by 10%. Segment margins were up by 290 basis points year-on-year, driven both by fixed cost leverage and by the mix shift toward higher margin software offerings. In Geospatial, revenues grew organically by 1%. Our && revenue in this segment breaks down across three broad categories: field sales to end users, government business, and OEM business. Sales of our core survey and mapping products to end users returned to meaningful growth in the quarter, reflecting a healthier state of dealer inventories and improving underlying market conditions. Offsetting the strong end user growth, component sales to OEMs were down as we lapped some unusually large shipments a year ago. Segment margins were up by 180 basis points, driven principally by lower component input costs versus year-ago levels. In Resources and Utilities, organic revenue for the quarter was down year-on-year by 4%. Excluding sales of products to agriculture customers, Resources and Utilities revenues were up by approximately 10%. Segment operating margins were lower year-on-year by 160 basis points, driven principally by lower revenue. In Transportation, revenue was up 1% organically. Segment organic ARR was up mid-single digit as growth in our transportation enterprise software and MAPS businesses offset the anticipated impact of churn in our North American mobility offerings. Transporeon remains an inorganic comparison, and the highlight in the quarter for Transporeon was achieving a record level of bookings, up over 20% versus prior year. We were encouraged by the sales performance of the team in light of the difficult macro dynamics in Transporeon's core European market. Segment margins increased year-on-year by 610 basis points, reflecting the higher margins of Transporeon and margin progression in the balance of the segment. Let's move now to 2024 guidance on Slide 11. I will focus on our performance, excluding our Agriculture business and including on a go-forward basis, our more limited exposure to Ag, as a 15% owner of the JV and a supplier of products to the JV. For the sake of completeness, we show on Page 11, two views: a reported view with the Ag business included through the first quarter of 2024; and an as-adjusted view without the agriculture business, which will ultimately be operated within the JV. The outlook for ARR growth remains strong, driven by momentum across our AECO software businesses. We expect full year organic growth rates in the 11% to 13% range, off our year-end 2023 levels of $1.98 billion. As-adjusted organic revenues are expected to grow for the year in the 4% to 7% range. Please note that our fiscal 2024 will include 53 weeks, and the extra week will increase full year and fourth quarter revenues by approximately $85 million. On an as-adjusted basis, we expect margins to improve, with EBITDA margins between 26.5% and 27.5%. This represents margin improvement year-on-year of between 100 basis points and 200 basis points. The margin improvement will come from a combination of improved software mix and the impact of the cost actions we took coming out of 2023. From a cash flow perspective, we expect full year cash flow of approximately 0.85 times non-GAAP net income. Excluding the costs relating to our AGCO JV transaction and the impact of the 53rd week, free cash flow is estimated to be approximately equal to non-GAAP net income. Our base cash flow forecast assumes no change in tax legislation. A bill moving through the U.S. Congress will, if enacted, restore the immediate expensing of R&D for tax purposes. If passed, this legislation would improve incrementally our cash outlook for 2024 by approximately $130 million. Our EPS forecast for the year reflects the beneficial impact of our planned deleveraging following the close of the AGCO JV and up to $800 million of share repurchase. We expect EPS for the year in the range of $2.60 to $2.80. I'll finish by offering a few comments on how our guidance for 2024 breaks out by quarter and by segment. We expect organic revenue growth to be strongest in Buildings and Infrastructure. Software businesses in Buildings and Infrastructure are expected to grow in the mid to high teens with product-related businesses up slightly, leading to organic revenue growth for the full year of between 11% and 13%. Buildings and Infrastructure organic growth includes approximately $70 million from the 53rd week. We plan to accelerate model conversions from perpetual to subscription software, tied with hardware in our civil construction business. Geospatial revenue is expected to be down slightly on an organic basis, with growth in field sales and survey offset by lower sales to U.S. federal customers where business tends to be lumpy from year-to-year. We will also accelerate model conversions from perpetual to subscription software in our survey and mapping business. Resources and Utilities as-adjusted organic growth will be up in the high-single digits, led primarily by continued growth in our positioning services business. Transportation revenues are expected to be up in the mid-single digits for the year and relatively flat on an organic basis, with growth in Transporeon offset by lower North American mobility revenue. We expect reduced hardware revenue in mobility, as we are intentionally pivoting that business away from lower-margin hardware sales to OEMs, instead focusing on the higher value-added data flows. From an operating margin perspective, we expect to grow margins year-over-year in the Buildings and Infrastructure and Resources and Utilities segments. Transportation margins will be up slightly, while Geospatial segment margins are expected to be down year-over-year due to changes in customer and product mix. For the first quarter, let's turn to Slide 12 for additional color. On an as-adjusted basis, we expect organic growth between 2% and 6%, and EBITDA margin between 26% and 27%. Buildings and Infrastructure is expected to drive most of the organic growth in the first quarter, with low-single digit growth in Geospatial. As-adjusted Resources and Utilities is expected to post high-single digit revenue growth in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we expect to see softness in Ag. Weakness in the global ag market is certainly a factor, but the bigger driver is the expected impact of the transition in our distribution strategy. Transportation revenues in the quarter are expected to be down modestly on an organic basis. Overall, we expect sequential improvement in Transportation segment organic growth rates as the year progresses, driven by gradually improving end market conditions and the inclusion of Transporeon in our organic trends, beginning in the second quarter. As Rob mentioned earlier, we are moving to implement a new segment reporting structure that reflects our updated organization and the way we will evaluate our businesses and allocate capital going forward. Our plan is to publish more details on our new segment reporting structure later in the first quarter, with financials going back two years and the perspective on how our 2024 annual guidance cascades to the new segments. We will have a separate conference call with investors to review that information when it is available. Rob, I'll turn it back over to you. Good morning. Hey, Tami, it's David Barnes. One thing I'll say, just as context, is digital transformations and big process and system projects are really hard, and our experience is no different. We ended 2023 with about 15% of our revenue going through the new digital platform, that's principally the North American AECO software businesses. We've been rethinking the scope and focus of our next phase of digital transformation. We'll go from 15% to probably closer to 35% here in early 2024, and that involves bringing more of our businesses. So, including the e-Builder and Cityworks suites, and then expanding the AECO effort all over the globe. We're right now in the process of rethinking how our digital platform interacts best with our hardware businesses and with transportation. So, I'll be -- I'll hold-off in giving a forecast on how we go from 35% to more of the business. I think, we have a more informed and smarter approach now, and we're rethinking our priorities. Yeah, that's right. Rob said in his commentary earlier that the AECO business is the tip of the spear. It's where we see the highest, most direct early returns through the digital transformation and TC1 and selling bundles. So, that's where our focus is at the moment. Yeah. So, as Rob said, structurally, our recurring revenue businesses are higher gross margin, you can see from disclosure, it's about 80% gross margin on the recurring revenue streams versus about 50% on the product stream. So, a lot of the roughly 100 basis point to 200 basis point margin improvement become -- flows directly from the ongoing mix shift of the business. With regard to the 53rd week, we quantified that that'll have about an $85 million revenue benefit for the year, all in the last quarter. The one thing I'll say though, is that's not the only discreet factor that's impacting our business. As I mentioned in my remarks, our business with big government customers, particularly the U.S. federal government, is lumpy from year-to-year. We talked about that as being a good factor earlier in 2023. So, that'll work against us. And then, we're doing model conversions focused on the software that's bundled with hardware. So, if you actually take the change in the federal business and the impact of the model conversions added to the 53rd week, they roughly offset each other. So, my way of looking at the underlying growth momentum of the business, I would say the 53rd week is a positive. Those other factors offset that positive and they're relatively neutral. Sure. Okay. Let me start with the last point. So, when we announced the Ag deal, we said that the impact on a '23 pro forma basis of the divestiture of Ag was about 70 basis points negative to operating margins, so that's where we started, and you can see the '24 outlook in our as-adjusted table. The principal drivers from there, as I mentioned earlier, we're planning on an as-adjusted basis, i.e., without the Ag business in the base, 100 basis points to 200 basis points of margin improvement. One way to think of that, Chad, is essentially all of it is in the gross margin improvement, which is a natural impact of mix. If you drill down a little more, we do have the benefit of cost reduction, but we are adding resources where it's driving growth. In fact, all or slightly more than all of our year-on-year OpEx is in our AECO business, where we had over 30% bookings growth, and we have about 20% ARR growth, we are really allocating our operating capital to pour the coal on that on that business. So, you can think of it as taking the cost reductions we've taken and reallocating it to the highest-return, highest-growth business."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Trimble Third Quarter 2023 Results Call. [Operator Instructions] And finally, I would like to advise all participants that this call is being recorded. Thank you. I\u2019d now like to welcome Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer to begin the conference. Rob, over to you.\nRob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which refer to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. Simplification, focus and execution are the themes of today. I will start with a review of the third quarter, then put a Trimble lens in the current market environment we see, followed by an overview of how we are taking action to maintain our strategic and financial progression. Let\u2019s begin on Slide 2 with a review of the third quarter. The clear highlights were continued ARR growth and gross margin progression, which translated into EBITDA progression. ARR stands at a record $1.94 billion, up 25% and up 13% organically. 50% of our revenue is now recurring. Gross margin finished at a record 65%, a reflection of our Connect and Scale strategy translating into a more durable and attractive business model. EBITDA at 28% is also a record. The big strategic news of the quarter was the announcement of our joint venture with AGCO in our agriculture business. Slide 3 reviews our key messages to shareholders. The venture positions us to simplify, focus and derisk our business while deleveraging and returning capital to shareholders. As we discussed on our announcement call, the impact on pro forma 2023 numbers moves Trimble to 72% software and 55% recurring revenue. We are proud to partner with Eric Hansotia and his team at AGCO to be a global leader in mixed fleet smart farming and autonomy solutions. We expect the transaction to close in the first half of next year. And I\u2019d like to say that we are really pleased thus far with the internal and external reaction to our partnership. In the quarter, we also divested our Landfolio business, which had approximately $10 million of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. We have now divested 18 businesses over the last 3 years and pursued a simplification and better focus to execute our strategy. Looking at the business with a global macroeconomic lens, we see increasing signs of weakness and stress across many end markets and geographies, exacerbated by interest rates, war and geopolitical tensions. These factors contribute to our updated view on the fourth quarter, which have embedded bearish and bullish signals. On the bearish side, we see the downturn in residential construction impacting our hardware businesses in both Buildings & Infrastructure and Geospatial. While we see strength in major projects, renewables and onshoring of manufacturing, we aren\u2019t seeing enough earthmoving activity to overcome this dynamic, especially in Europe. In agriculture, within resources and utilities, we see emerging signs of weakness also notably in Europe. We also expect some choppiness in the numbers as we execute our new distribution strategy in preparation for our AGCO joint venture. In transportation, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we are in a down freight market, and we\u2019ve seen some trucking and technology companies either go out of business or cut back their ambitions significantly. On the bullish side, let\u2019s remember that we sell productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. This is a secular value proposition. In Buildings and Infrastructure, software bookings were up more than 30%, demonstrable evidence that the strategy works and that the dollar volume of construction is healthy. Our Trimble Construction One business model framework is delivering results. We are releasing a series of customer persona-based targeted offerings and our systems enhancements are providing new levels of visibility and insight into our customers. Machine control as a service offering also exceeded bookings expectations in the quarter. In Geospatial, we continue to innovate to drive the replacement cycle and our new business models contribute to ARR growing at a double-digit rate within the surveying and mapping business. Next week, we will hold our Annual Trimble Dimensions Engineering and Construction User Conference, where thousands of industry participants will come together to learn and engage in our latest innovations. In resources and utilities, our non-ag businesses collectively grew ARR double-digits. In transportation, the shakeout in the industry will, in time, have the appropriate effect of restoring the balance in capacity and demand and bringing more discipline to the competitive landscape. Against this backdrop, we are taking action to protect our financial model, starting with a greater than $40 million run-rate cost reduction initiative as we take action to simplify and better focus our company to operate efficiently and effectively. This is in addition to cost containment initiatives that we undertook in the third quarter. We will simplify by reorganizing our operating businesses and bringing corporate resources closer to customers. For example, we have incubated our industry cloud platform work at a corporate level the last couple of years. It\u2019s now time to embed that within the business and sharpen capital allocation. We will focus by getting the right leaders in the right seats and scaling back some of our initiatives to enable the core to better deliver short and mid-term outcomes. David, over to you.\nDavid Barnes: Thank you, Rob. Let\u2019s start on Slide 4 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue of $957 million was up 8% in total and up 2% organically. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 1%, while acquisitions net of divestitures increased revenue by 5%. Subscription and recurring revenue continued to grow at a strong rate. As Rob mentioned a moment ago, the weakening macro environment adversely impacted customer sentiment and demand across all of our hardware end markets. Gross margin in the third quarter was a record 65%, up 410 basis points year-over-year, driven by an increasingly favorable business mix and the ongoing net impact of pricing and reduced input cost inflation. Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins also expanded year-over-year due to the progression in gross margins and the benefit of cost reduction actions we took early in the quarter. Net income dollars increased by 4% and earnings per share grew year-over-year to $0.68, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance range. We are very pleased with our margin performance in the third quarter, delivering strong bottom line results even in the face of a tougher macroeconomic environment. Turning now to Slide 5, I\u2019ll review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends. On this and the next few pages, I will focus on organic growth rates, excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations. ARR was up 13%, driven in part by strong bookings across our construction software businesses. Our digital platform work is enabling cross-sell of bundled solutions. Our non-recurring revenue streams, including hardware and perpetual software, contracted by 8% year-over-year and came in below our expectations. The macro environment worsened late in the quarter across many of our hardware end markets with weakening customer sentiment and propensity to invest. The impact was especially visible in Europe, where macro trends are the most difficult. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 5%. In Europe, revenues were down 1%. Moving to Slide 6. Our cash flow from operations was $147 million with free cash flow of $134 million, both of which are up significantly versus prior year. Our cash flow in the quarter benefited from lower purchases of inventory, lower tax payments and higher profitability. The working capital dynamics of our business remains strong with negative net working capital. We entered the fourth quarter with $1.6 billion in backlog inclusive of ag committed backlog expected to ship before our ag JV transaction closes. We project that $1.1 billion of our backlog will be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months. We ended the quarter with leverage measured as net debt to EBITDA of 2.9x, reflecting the repayment of $115 million of net debt during the quarter and repayment of $270 million since the closing of the Transporeon acquisition. Note that we are ahead of our time line to pay-down our Transporeon debt with leverage going below 3x one quarter ahead of the commitment we made when the deal was announced. Finally, I\u2019ll repeat what Rob mentioned earlier. During the quarter, we reached an important milestone with half of our revenue now coming from recurring revenue streams. The formation of our ag JV will further accelerate our business in the direction of majority recurring revenue, making our business both more predictable and more resilient. Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 7 for additional detail on each of our reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 6%. Revenue growth was strong across our software businesses in the segment with double-digit year-over-year ARR and revenue increases at e-Builder, Viewpoint, SketchUp and Tekla. This broad-based growth reflects the success and momentum of our Connect and Scale strategy, evidenced by growing bookings, especially of larger and broader bundles. Our Civil Construction business was down year-over-year at a high single-digit rate as the demand environment weakened among dealers and end customers. Geospatial revenue was down 2%, reflecting lower demand across many survey end markets. One bright spot for our Geospatial business in the quarter was with our U.S. federal government customers, who continue to place orders well ahead of prior year levels and above our expectations earlier in the year. Resources and Utilities revenue was down 4%, reflecting both declining farmer sentiment and the impact of our distribution network changes. Revenue declines were most pronounced in Europe, which makes up the largest portion of our ag hardware business. Partially offsetting the weakness in hardware demand, we experienced double-digit segment ARR growth in Positioning Services, forestry and Cityworks. Financial results in our Transportation segment showed progression in a number of areas. Organic ARR was up at a mid-single-digit rate and margins expanded for the seventh quarter in a row. On the other hand, our mobility business in North America has not seen the uptick in bookings that we originally expected. With planned chart notifications in the quarter, our Transportation segment ARR momentum will moderate going into next year. Transporeon top line trends remain below our expectations when we bought the business, driven almost entirely by a contraction in overall industry shipment volumes and the depressed spot market. Importantly, we have maintained our customers and our market share. And with our transaction-based recurring model, we are positioned to recover with an improvement in the overall European goods economy when the inevitable upswing takes place. The Transporeon team has managed costs well in this tough environment, and our operating margin since the deal closed remained in line with our original expectations. Moving to Slide 8, I will now discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our third quarter results reflect a weakening demand environment. We expect this weakness to extend through the fourth quarter and into next year. We now project fourth quarter revenue between $890 million and $930 million. Our fourth quarter outlook reflects 13% growth in ARR, offset by a decline in our hardware and perpetual software at a low to mid-single-digit rate. This yields a full year revenue outlook of $3.76 billion to $3.80 billion. A significant majority of the reduction in revenue outlook is in our hardware businesses with the biggest impact in Civil Construction Hardware. For perspective, it is helped to look back to the pre-COVID period to determine the underlying long-term trends of our hardware businesses. All three of our core hardware businesses, Geospatial, Agriculture and Civil Construction, have grown at a compound rate of mid-single digit or better since 2019, and our fourth quarter guidance reflects a continuation of this long-term trend. We project that the combined impact of higher gross margins and lower operating expense versus our prior outlook will offset much of the impact of our lower revenue forecast, resulting in an EPS range for the fourth quarter of $0.55 to $0.63. Our updated full year guidance for EPS is $2.58 to $2.66. Fourth quarter operating margins are projected to be in the range of 24.5% to 25%, a meaningful improvement from year ago levels, but sequentially down from the third quarter, driven primarily by mix. Within the overall outlook for the fourth quarter, we anticipate the following segment trends. Buildings and Infrastructure will remain our strongest segment with organic revenue in the quarter accelerating from third quarter levels to the mid- to high single digits. Even in the current macro environment, we see strong demand for our software offerings, while our hardware businesses are expected to be down at a mid-single-digit rate. Geospatial segment revenues are expected to be down at a low to mid-single-digit rate in the fourth quarter. Gradual improvement across some areas of our core field survey business will be offset by lower sales in the fourth quarter to the U.S. federal government. Geospatial margins in the fourth quarter will come down sequentially from third quarter levels due to a less favorable business mix. Resources and Utilities revenue are expected to be flat to down at a low single-digit rate. This fourth quarter outlook reflects both the adverse overall demand environment and the impact of our ongoing aftermarket dealer network transition. ARR growth in the segment will remain at a strong double-digit level. Transportation segment revenues will be flat or down modestly as the impact of higher customer churn in our North American mobility business offsets the growth across the rest of our transportation offerings. This outlook assumes no meaningful improvement in Transporeon\u2019s core European transportation market in the fourth quarter. From a cash flow perspective, we expect full year 2023 free cash flow in the range of $530 million to $555 million. Excluding the impact of full year transaction-related and restructuring-related cash outflows of approximately $100 million, this outlook represents free cash flow of approximately 1x net income. With our strong year-to-date cash flow performance and with contractual certainty on the upcoming close of our Ag JV transaction, we plan to reinitiate share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Consistent with past practice, we plan to issue guidance for 2024 at our fourth quarter earnings release in February. At this point, our outlook for next year can be characterized threefold. First, we expect that organic revenue growth trends will be better than those we posted this year as our hardware business has stabilized following the declines of 2023 and as recurring revenue sources make up a growing proportion of our total revenue base. Second, we believe ARR will continue to grow at a double-digit rate. Even in the context of a tough macro environment, our bookings and net retention performance continue to support this outlook. Third, with the cost reduction actions we are taking, we expect to hold or improve EBITDA margins even with the impact of the close of our AGCO deal. This outlook leaves us on track to achieve the EBITDA margin goals we put forward in our Investor Day last year. Rob, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.\nRob Painter: I want to end the call on the same themes we started with today simplification, focus and execution. The cost action and the organizational moves we\u2019ve discussed, in addition to the forthcoming Ag joint venture, all drive simplification and enhanced focus on our Connect and Scale strategy. On execution, we humbly learned from our failures and successes. We also have the confidence and conviction to manage through this economic environment. We\u2019ve done this for decades, we know what we need to do, and we will stay focused on delivering productivity, quality, safety, transparency and sustainability for our customers. And we will continue to invest and innovate against our best growth opportunities. We will exit this economic downturn on a stronger competitive footing. Finally, we are announcing today that David Barnes has decided that he will retire as our CFO in May. Phil Sawarynski, our Vice President of Corporate Development, Treasurer and Co-Head of Trimble Ventures, will succeed David. David, Phil and our strong finance team will work together to ensure a smooth transition over that timeframe. I\u2019m very grateful for having had David\u2019s steady hand over the last 4 years as we\u2019ve navigated crises that neither of us ever envisioned. True character reveals itself in a crisis. David\u2019s character represents something we would all benefit from emulating. Phil comes into the role having been at Trimble for 14 years, having worked across a very diverse set of roles along the way. Phil\u2019s mandate for the role is straightforward to leverage his deep knowledge of the company to unlock shareholder value. Operator, we can now open the line to questions.\nOperator: Thank you for the presentation. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning everyone and David congratulations.\nDavid Barnes: Thanks, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Rob, David, I\u2019m wonder if you could just talk about the outlook for ARR growth for the construction software portfolio. It looks like you\u2019re seeing a slowing into the fourth quarter based on the ARR guidance revision. Can you just expand on what that means for the construction portfolio, specifically where you\u2019re nearly 20% in the quarter, what magnitude of slowing are you seeing there and touch on other moving pieces, if you don\u2019t mind.\nRob Painter: Hi. Good morning, Jerry and thanks for the question. This is Rob. I\u2019ll take it. Actually, the bookings for the software businesses and construction continue to be strong in the third quarter. The ARR growth in the B&I segment was over 20% for the quarter as well in Q3. So actually, I see continued strengths into the fourth quarter with our view on ARR growth in that segment. So actually, I would say really the narrative holds there. FX is a bit of a headwind to the ARR growth that will be posted at the top line. So adjusted for that, I think we remain on track.\nDavid Barnes: Yes, hey, Jerry the changes in ARR growth, we\u2019re talking tens of basis points. The big story is that the growth is sustained as Rob said, bookings are really good. There\u2019s no fundamental change in the momentum of our B&I ARR business.\nJerry Revich: Okay. So FX is a key driver then. Okay. And then can we shift gears and talk about the margin trajectory, given that performance in the quarter and exiting the year. I know we\u2019re not talking about \u201824 guidance yet, but it feels like you\u2019ve got margin tailwinds versus the run rate in the first half of 2023. So as we think about the puts and takes around what \u201824 might look like, obviously, some end market challenges. But it feels like, at least on a year-over-year basis, there should be some margin momentum. I\u2019m wondering, if you wouldn\u2019t mind commenting on any other puts and takes we should keep in mind?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. Sure, Jerry. I\u2019ll reiterate the comments in the prepared remarks. Our margin trends are very strong. We think sequentially, Q4 won\u2019t look quite as good as Q3. We had \u2013 that\u2019s a mix issue, both between software and hardware and within the hardware part of our portfolio. But fundamentally, our margin story is really good. And we\u2019ve taken actions to manage our operating expense very carefully. Actually, that started early this year. Rob mentioned that we\u2019re going to move even further here in Q4. Our goal is looking into next year to be in a position where we can maintain or grow our EBITDA margins. And I\u2019ll point out that we\u2019re \u2013 that includes the impact of the creation of the Ag JV. And if you go back to the financial remarks we had when we made that announcement, we said the creation of the JV puts downward pressure of 70 basis points on our EBITDA margin. We\u2019re looking to cover that. So yes, margin is a great story. Obviously, the top line on the hardware part of our business has been softer than we anticipated. But the margin story is even better, and that\u2019s something we are carefully managing looking into next year.\nJerry Revich: Super. And lastly, can you just comment on leading indicators within Transporeon? I don\u2019t know if you folks have visibility based on that business in terms of customers prepared shipping plans or anything along those lines. And how are you thinking about fourth quarter seasonally for that part of the portfolio?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. So as you can imagine, we\u2019re \u2013 we have visibility every day to a very significant portion of the European transportation market. I think I\u2019d characterize it as stabilizing after a very weak period over \u2013 after the last three or four quarters, well, since we bought the business. We\u2019re not declaring a turnaround yet. But if you look at the metrics of transportation volumes, spot pricing, capacity utilization, not necessarily getting better, but it stopped getting worse. So we can see the stabilization and over time, very hard to predict exactly when. But over time, those will recover and with our transaction-based ARR model, the business will recover with it. So it\u2019s stabilizing. It\u2019s still the freight market in Europe. And I think in America, you characterize it as in recession, particularly some of the end markets. Actually, we can see by part of the economy what\u2019s weak, where there is fewer trucks on the road, shipping goods. But construction equipment, paper and packaging are way down versus last year, reflecting the overall macroeconomic weakness. So we think we\u2019ve stabilized. That\u2019s the basis of our fourth quarter, and we will plan for some improvement looking into next year, but we will be cautious, given the magnitude of the drop that occurred over the last three quarters.\nRob Painter: And Jerry, if that\u2019s the macro. When I look at the micro to complement that, we have 100% customer retention and our win-loss ratios are holding. So our market share is holding in the region. I think that\u2019s important to keep in mind as well for the underlying health of the business.\nJerry Revich: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRob Wertheimer: Hi, I have two questions, if I may. The first one is a little bit micro, I guess. But could you look at channel inventory across the businesses on the hardware side? And just do you have an estimate or a ballpark of how much channel inventory there is to come out if you could see a destock and how long that might take? And then the second question is really for Rob, because your tone obviously indicates a more negative macro environment kind of already here. And I\u2019m a bit curious if you\u2019re seeing that in today\u2019s construction market or whether that\u2019s more of a forecast? Thanks.\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Rob, it\u2019s David. I\u2019ll take the dealer inventory question first. We did see a very meaningful inventory destock in the first half of this year, particularly in the first quarter. You probably recall, I said we estimate it was about $40 million in the first quarter, less than that in the second quarter. It\u2019s not really a factor in the back half of this year. Actually, in some of our end markets, dealer inventory went up by just a little bit in Q3. The one change we\u2019re seeing, and Rob referenced this in his remarks, is that on the civil side, we\u2019re seeing the set point, the desired inventory level for our dealers has actually come down. That reflects higher interest rates, so higher cost of carrying inventory. It reflects the uncertainty about the demand market and frankly, our very good product supply. So the need to hold inventory is less than it was. So that won\u2019t be helpful to us. I think we will see a modest correction. Nowhere near like Q1 and Q4. We\u2019re talking in the $10 million to $20 million range. But we think dealer inventories in aggregate are close to where they will be over the longer-term.\nRob Painter: I\u2019ll take the second part, Rob, on the macro and what we\u2019re seeing. There is a tale of geographies embedded within that \u2013 within the answer. So I\u2019ll roughly speaking to North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Let\u2019s look at North America. You won\u2019t be surprised that sub-segments such as the data centers, the renewable energy, the onshoring and manufacturing, those are all positive catalysts. The Infrastructure Bill remains a positive catalyst. The asterisk on that one is when you compare the dollar volume within the dollars associated with infrastructure build, compared to the dirt actually moved is what we see as inflation has been eating up a fair amount of that additional spend. And then residential. For sure, we see interest rates having an impact in the residential markets. In Europe, I would say you have the same factors, but you have residential is worse than what we see in the U.S. And Asia Pacific, we see \u2013 well, not surprisingly, we see India being better. We see China being worse. You connect the China economy to a decent amount of the Australian economy, and we see some of the residential construction being slower in that market. So add those up and you have our view on the present state of construction. And let me be clear, within that is we have software businesses and we have hardware businesses. I mentioned it during the first question that we had 30% bookings increase in our construction software business in the third quarter. We had ARR growing over 20% in B&I. So there is a different behavior happening within the software business and within the hardware business. The feedback that we get from the market on that is that customers, they continue to have trouble finding qualified labor, managing that labor. They have strong overall backlog, particularly in the Americas. And so that backlog and that complexity and managing the workout in the field is a catalyst for the software adoption and that plays through into the numbers we have. So now we take the present and we map to the future, which was the other part of your question. We\u2019re essentially saying we don\u2019t see it getting better, fundamentally better, fundamentally inflecting, particularly on the residential, and that\u2019s the one probably I should comment on most discretely as our planning assumption at this point is assumed into 2024 that it doesn\u2019t get better. Of course, when interest rates come down, that will be a positive thing next year. And we know in places like here in the U.S. that we do need additional housing. So there is a dislocation, fundamental dislocation. So as the interest rates moderate, I think it\u2019s reasonable to think that, that will get better. But for now, our planning assumption, I think the smart thing to do is just assume it doesn\u2019t.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason from Baird. Your line is open.\nRob Mason: Hi. Yes, good morning. Just to go back to the expectations around overall ARR. Like you said, it did not sound like there is much movement in your outlook around the B&I related to ARR. What about transportation? Should we expect that, that still tracks up mid-single digits, the track that it\u2019s been on?\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Rob, it\u2019s David Barnes. I\u2019ll take that. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that bookings are coming in soft in our North American mobility business in transportation and we received notification turn that will occur going forward. So our \u2013 while our ARR has been looking better recently, we do think that will \u2013 the churn we have in our North American mobility business will adversely affect transportation ARR growth in Q4 and going into next year by somewhere around 200 basis points. Now I\u2019ll emphasize that the rest of the transportation ARR base is doing really well. Our Maps business is growing ARR at double-digit rate, even Transporeon were growing ARR. Our enterprise business is growing ARR. Actually, our mobility business in Europe and in Brazil is good. So the North American mobility business represents about quarter of transportation ARR, and that \u2013 the trends there are going to be more adverse. So the sort of core base outlook is for transportation, ARR growth to be adversely impacted by a couple of hundred basis points going forward because of the churn dynamic in North American mobility.\nRob Mason: Understood. Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up then. I understand you don\u2019t want to speak too broadly about 2024, and this may just be somewhat of a transitory dynamic with the AGCO transaction coming up. But just how should we think about the ending of the CNH aftermarket agreement and the impact relative to your efforts to try to backfill that. Obviously, AGCO is a solution. But until that transaction closes, I\u2019m just curious how to think about modeling that impact next year.\nRob Painter: Hey, Rob, that\u2019s a good question. I\u2019ll take that one. CNH continues to be an important customer and partner for Trimble and for the JV on an ongoing basis. So the nature of the agreement when we changed our approach to ag distribution and made the announcement the change in the relationship with that CNH aftermarket distribution, which we did earlier in the year. That\u2019s not a change from CNH as a customer and a partner, it really was saying we\u2019re going to \u2013 as we work with the dealers in the future, we need as part of our \u2013 through our strategy to be able to work with the dealers directly to have more of that signal of what\u2019s happening in the market and being closer to the end customer. So they have been an important customer. They are an important customer. They will be an important customer going forward, as well AGCO, obviously, through the nature of the joint venture and say, remember, we serve the mixed fleet. And that means all colors of iron, including over 100 OEMs that we work with today. So that\u2019s our view on the shape of the market. Now clearly, CNH will have an ambition set to have more of their own technology. And we know that \u2013 and you know that through the acquisitions that they have done. So in time, that will be, I\u2019d say, a topic but let\u2019s remember that we have hundreds of thousands of units out in the machine. We have many, many farms who operate on Trimble technology, and we believe we will continue to do so in the future. So there will be some disruption as we go through the change for sure. And we expected that. That\u2019s been largely in the numbers we\u2019ve had and certainly part of the conversation we had with AGCO when we establish a joint venture.\nRob Mason: Is there a way, Rob, to isolate how much \u2013 there was some reference to the distribution transition in the third quarter, how much impact that\u2019s causing the R&D segment today?\nRob Painter: I would measure it in, I\u2019d say, some millions of dollars, like so call it in the low single-digit percentage of the disruption. But I also think that, that could very well be a timing topic. In fairness to CNH dealers, in this case, there were two announcements this year, one when at the beginning of the year, when we talked about changing the arc of the relationship; and the second was the JV announcement. So I think it is reasonable to assume that some of these dealers have taken a step back and paused and sort of hear, hey, what does this mean and where do we go. There is demand out there in the market and customers use our technology. So we believe through our new distribution strategy, the Vantage distribution strategy, that we can capture and meet that need out in the marketplace. It just may shift from, I\u2019d say, this year into next year.\nRob Mason: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to, I guess, better understand sort of your commentary around the bundling opportunities in the B&I business. Can you maybe help us understand maybe what the customers are seeing as they are starting to adopt Trimble One and some sort of your broader platform approach and maybe what that means from an upsell and ASP opportunity perspective?\nRob Painter: Good morning, Jonathan, good question. What we hear from \u2013 well, let\u2019s talk about what we\u2019re doing and what we hear from the customers. What we hear from customers is that similar to my remarks earlier is that they are looking to work with us in a differential way. They are looking to move from delivering task productivity to system productivity. They are looking to manage the volume of work that they have and the complexity they are in. They are looking at us and saying, we want to do more business with you, Trimble. It\u2019s in the \u2013 part of the consistent theme has been make yourselves easier to do business with. And that\u2019s where Trimble Construction One is part of that \u2013 is part of delivering that. And what we see from the data is we continue to grow the cross-sells. So we look at the cross-selling on a year-over-year basis, and it\u2019s a strong double-digit increase in the amount of cross-selling. And so we can manifest that cross-selling through, think of it as the TC1 offering. TC1 is a framework agreement essentially makes it easier to buy more Trimble solutions together in that bundle. And then where we go further with those bundles is defining those at a persona-based level, a customer persona-based level. That is to say a steel fabricator could use and benefit from a set of Trimble solutions different than the mechanical contract or different than the general contract or different than the architect. And so the persona-based bundling offerings create bundles specific to those personas. And at our best, we can offer or sort of fullest manifestation of this, we can offer a good, better, best offering within those personas. And we\u2019re still, I\u2019d say, quite early in this journey. And so that\u2019s one of the many things that gives me conviction that we\u2019ve got runway to work with here in the business.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. Can you give us a bit more color on how the machine control as a service business is trending? And how those deals sort of work and whether this can help customers in a more cost contained environment? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Thanks for that question. I actually probably should have mentioned that during the \u2013 in the call. We actually have seen a higher level of adoption of the machine control as a service than was in our original expectations. So actually, that creates a negative delta to the top line revenue, as you know, right, for a subscription as opposed to a perpetual sales. So the adoption in the third quarter actually really year-to-date has been ahead of the expectations that we have for the business. For sure, if you think about proxy in the software world, what we\u2019ve seen through the transitions we\u2019ve made is not only do you make the technology more affordable in doing so, you expand the size of the addressable market. And we\u2019ve seen that time and time again in the markets we\u2019ve served in software as we\u2019ve made these transitions. I\u2019d like to believe that, that\u2019s a possible outcome as well in the hardware world, is that we can expand the size of the addressable market. And you think about the cost environment that we\u2019re in or that we certainly we see that we\u2019re in and we see that as a positive catalyst in that market. But I think even more interesting than that is once you\u2019re monetizing on a subscription level on the machine control side, we believe it becomes much easier to package the relevant software offerings along with it as well. And so that\u2019s a preview of where some of our next releases will go into Civil Infrastructure bundles that capture relevant Trimble software along with the hardware. And then you asked about the business model that goes with it specifically. Well, we\u2019ve had two versions of it. One, you go straight subscription on the entirety of the offering. And the other one is you do a split with the hardware and the software, which is to say you\u2019d do a nominal amount upfront for some of the hardware and then you monetize the rest of the subscription. I think we\u2019re going to see us do more of the latter over time. You can create some, I\u2019d say, better aligned economics with the dealer channel in between when you have that upfront, a nominal amount of the hardware being sold upfront and actually also helps our cash flow ourselves as Trimble, and the customers have seemed to be reasonably indifferent of the two offerings. So that\u2019s where I think we will lean more into that one going forward.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Dillard from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nCharles Dillard: Hi, good morning, guys. So I just wanted to double-click on the cost cuts that you have highlighted in your prepared remarks, $40 million. So first of all, are you expecting that to hit full run rate in 2024? Second, can you give a little bit more color on how it\u2019s allocated? And third, how much is structural versus variable?\nRob Painter: So the \u2013 well, so it\u2019s all structural is the first answer on the number. Our expectation is that we come into 2024 with that in place to build a move forward on that one. And then within the subset of the allocation, here\u2019s how I\u2019d want to portray it as we look at the portfolio of activities and businesses that we have. First, you take our software businesses, particularly the ARR businesses that are posting the rule of 40, rule of 50 and in some cases, beyond where we\u2019ve got that growth. We\u2019re going to continue to invest and grow the expenses in that, where we\u2019re driving the bookings, which drives the ARR growth. And we look at the lifetime value to the customer acquisition cost as a strong measure of where to allocate capital. On the flip side, we look at activities that have been a little further out in their nature or where the shape of the market adoption is scaling back on, where the world is scaling back on, let\u2019s say, some of the ambition set that we have. And so we will look there. So it\u2019s very ROI based in our approach. And it\u2019s very strategic based because this is not going to be just a kind of a peanut butter approach. We will move activities that we have at the corporate level closer to the businesses, for example, the industry cloud work, that we have doing and we have been \u2013 I think we did the right thing to incubate that, the company \u2013 excuse me, through the corporate level for the last couple of years. Now we can get that embedded into a business and then sharpen the allocation within the business between the work we do within the short, mid and long-term.\nCharles Dillard: That\u2019s helpful. And then second question is just trying to understand how resilient the B&I business is to slow down. Maybe you can break it up into two parts, software versus hardware. Software sounds like based on bookings, it is relatively resilient. But I would love to understand like how long the contract duration is and how to think about that? And then on the hardware side, just try to think about significant amplitude there?\nRob Painter: Chad, the way I think about the software side is it certainly has proven thus far to be more resilient. Hey, with the software that you are using in Trimble, but I would say the same thing on the hardware. But the software our customers use is its mission-critical software. It\u2019s not sitting on a shelf. It\u2019s a nice to have. So, I would say as long as they have got customers have the backlog and the work and the customers have a need to digitize, the customers has a need to become more productive and more efficient and that\u2019s a good setup for the resilience of that business and I think we could trust we could create that as a mega trend happening within many industries is the digitization of the work. The other thing that drives resilience in our view is when we have been selling and when we are selling the bundled offerings, when we are working with customers in a broader and bigger way, we think that, that has us closer to the customers. As the relationships become closer, we think that, that drives continued usage of the technology over time. So, perfectly resilient, there is certainly \u2013 that can certainly be challenged at what point does that \u2013 what would it take for that to inflect. But we haven\u2019t seen it. And we look at from our gross retention, we look at the net retention ratios, we look at the cross-sell, up-sell opportunities we have. We think we are sitting on many hundreds of millions of dollars of opportunity just within the portfolio that we have. So, that makes me optimistic about the setup that we will have. Now, will the numbers grow in percentage terms as much over time while a lot of large numbers likely kicks in at some point. We are approaching \u2013 we are not just approaching $1 billion or almost at $1 billion of ARR just within the B&I segment alone. So, posting 20% ARR growth and 30% bookings growth is pretty special, and the team deserves the recognition for that. The hardware businesses, hey, the fact, brutal facts are that it is less resilient. The hardware is a book and burn business. Very little of it today is sold on a subscription basis. And yes, we would like to do more of that over time. Now, we also are in control of some of our own resilience. That is the expansion to machine types. It\u2019s geographic penetration. It\u2019s the combining the hardware and the software that we have at Trimble to drive resilience into that. So, I don\u2019t think we are just victim to the environment around us. I also think there is a lot we can control within that. And I will net that out by saying I don\u2019t think that hardware is ultimately as resilient as the software. However, I think it is as powerful as the software, because what we can uniquely do at Trimble is connect the physical and digital worlds, that ability to connect the work in the office and the field and the hardware and software is especially unique and different.\nCharles Dillard: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nKristen Owen: Hey. Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on some of the B&I commentary and just given some of the success that you have noted in becoming easier to do business with. I am wondering if you can speak to market share versus wallet share gains. How much of the growth are you experiencing is coming through customers just using more Trimble products versus maybe any shift in the competitive landscape, or are you merely just tackling white space there?\nRob Painter: Hi. Good morning Kristen. It\u2019s a good question and thanks for that. The \u2013 I would say the reality is that there is a lot of white space within the market, and we look at the peers in the construction technology space, and many of them are also continuing to grow. And so I look at the map of the collective growth of peers and the industry. And to me, the only way the math works on that is that there is a secular adoption of the technology as the industry digitizes. We know it\u2019s a greater than $1 trillion industry in construction that has historically been underserved and underpenetrated with technology and the trends around that are a positive catalyst for the adoption of technology. So, let me start with acknowledging that. Now within that, what we see is from the cross-selling that we are doing, that to me is a metric where I would call that the wallet share that says we are doing something that\u2019s unique and different and we think that nobody else can do that quite like we can. We have technology that serves the \u2013 across the AECO landscape, architects, engineers, construction and the owners. That\u2019s quite different, and that\u2019s just the software, but now bring in the hardware components that happen there. And not just the hardware that\u2019s in with B&I, but the hardware that\u2019s within survey. Because the survey ultimately is creates the digital \u2013 starts the workflow that is creating the digital model and then turning very often into a set of construction workflows from there. On the market share topic, we do believe that we are gaining share within certain market segments and certain market segments and certain customers. And I qualify that with the word certain. I would say if you could characterize customers simply put as some who buy on best of breed or some who buy best of suite. When customers are buying best of suite, I would say we are gaining share with those customers because we can offer increasingly a better native integration of that data and the workflow across the industry life cycle. And we see positive feedback and uptick for customer who are wanting to buy suites from companies. I would say for those who buy best of breed, I would say we hold our own overall. But even within that, I could say I could double-click within the construction ERP business, I would say we are clearly who gained share in the markets that we serve. I look in the architecture space, with the SketchUp product, we are going on multiple years now very, very strong double digit ARR growth and that to me would suggest, we are gaining some share in the conceptual modeling.\nKristen Owen: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you, Rob. I am going to shift gears a little bit. You talked about the macro environment, some of the headwinds facing the transportation business. But at 18.2% operating margins, this is the highest segment operating margin that you printed since before the ELD Mandates. So, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit about maybe what\u2019s working on the cost side of the equation for that business, how much of that is uplift from Transporeon versus some of the hard work that you guys have been doing over the last couple of years? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Good question. I would give you a two-fold answer. First, I would say within the, call it, the run rate [ph] business, we have within transportation and then second is the Transporeon dynamic. Within the run rate business that we have, we have been working steadily to clearly the increase the gross margins and that we have in the business and I think to me the path that I think about was growing operating margins I go straight to the structural topic around that at the gross margin level and so to have which implies both have the products with the right eye proposition that get the right price and we got the right set of COGS that are associated with that and it\u2019s becoming more software-centric. In transportation, I want to be less dependent on the hardware. In fact, in the more long-term basis, being more hardware agnostic on the telematics side of the business, whereas hardware differentiates, truly differentiates throughout the rest of Trimble. It\u2019s less so the case with the onboard computer in that side of the business. So, that\u2019s a structural shift, right, when we can \u2013 when we really manifest more software forward, that\u2019s a structural increase in the gross margin that can flow down to the profitability of the business. And then the other way you do that as you are getting the gross margins where they need to be, and it\u2019s also managing the operating expenses along with that, so which the team has done a, I would say, a pretty good and certainly steady job of incrementing that forward for many quarters now as you noted. Now, you layer in Transporeon on top of that and that is accretive to the margins within the segment. And so if we do our job and if the market will do us some favors here and start to turn next year, then that would again be a positive catalyst for the margins in the business.\nKristen Owen: Thank you so much.\nRob Painter: Next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJason Celino: Great and just one for me. This follows up on one of the other questions. When we think about B&I hardware and construction software, who are the typical decision-makers at your customers? Like are they separate budget decisions? How tight are those purchasing decisions between the two? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good way of thinking about it.\nRob Painter: Hey Jason. Thanks for the question. I would say it depends on the size of the customer between the hardware and the software. And not surprisingly, in the small to mid-market, we are doing more with the C-levels of our customers. And then I would say the bigger the customer, the more it\u2019s segmented across the company who is the economic buyer. Let me say something I think strategically your question unlocks is the nature of moving from selling more point solutions to selling connected offerings. Because what we do see happening as increasingly as you should make that shift from the point solution to the connected offering, you are doing more account-based selling. It is a fundamentally different approach on the go-to-market side of how we sell and who we sell to at our customers. So, historically you might have had \u2013 you could have had the virtual design and construction department deciding on some technology, then they are going to use. You can have field crew deciding which hardware machine control or survey kit they want to use out in the field. As we move to these bigger offerings, the nature of that is actually, the dollar amount becomes higher even as we move this to \u2013 from the perpetual over to a subscription basis. And we see it from the uplift when we see, when we can bring customers who are already subscribing to us and now who are taking bigger part of the portfolio, we see where we get a multiple uplift. But naturally, as those dollar uplifts go higher, we are starting very often to work with the different set of people within the organizations and within our customers. Now, that level often has already been using and been the customer at that ERP level because who is typically buying the ERP is going to be more of the CFO type who is buying that. So, now when you think about it, we are able to go to that person with the bigger offering. That\u2019s a different sales motion for us. And so actually, we see that as a very positive thing for us, is changing the nature of the economic buyers when we are offering a solution.\nJason Celino: Well, the \u2013 I guess my quick follow-up here is the hardware weakness you are seeing. Is it mostly with the smaller customers who may not be as penetrated at Trimble, either on the hardware or software side?\nRob Painter: Oh, I see what you are asking. That\u2019s a good question. I have to \u2013 let\u2019s say let me think more about that and come back with a more data, a fact-based answer on that. We have been looking more at the nature of the end markets that are being served and those who do more residential work or infrastructure work. I mind you, many contractors do both kinds of work. If you are a civil contractor, you are \u2013 have to be buying more Trimble software that\u2019s going to be set your business. If you are doing residential construction, you are doing more single-family construction, you are not buying a Trimble ERP. It\u2019s too big for you if you are doing that kind of residential construction. By the time you are doing multifamily, there is a set of additional technology becomes more applicable. So, probably I am answering your question now as I talk about that out loud.\nJason Celino: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Tilton: Hey guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here. My first question is kind of a high level one. But I think throughout the numerous answers to questions in the Q&A. You talked about the strength of the bundle that you guys have. It feels like with macro getting worse, like we hear about it in other software sectors, but now is the time when customers want to go all in on the bundle and kind of to achieve their software goals, save some money and drive an ROI. So, I guess my question is like why aren\u2019t we seeing that offset some of the other weakness a little bit more? And maybe when should investors expect to see maybe the environment benefit demand for the attractive bundle that you guys sell?\nDavid Barnes: Hi Josh, it\u2019s David. First of all, I would say that we are seeing that in the software business where Rob mentioned the 30%-plus bookings in our construction software business, ARR is still really strong, growing at 20%. So, that business is benefiting from the clear path to value and Rob mentioned labor constraints that our construction customers have and software technology being needed. The hardware side is more \u2013 I will point out within B&I, our hardware is sold to civil contractors, so it\u2019s a more narrow range of customers then buy our software. And the sale of our hardware for that segment is driven by, to use Rob\u2019s, moving dirt. And while the infrastructure dollars are going up, if you take the inflation and back that out, labor and materials cost inflation, the actual amount of dirt being moved has not risen much over time, and that\u2019s the fundamental driver of our B&I hardware business. So, the demand of the actual \u2013 for technology to moving the earth isn\u2019t \u2013 hasn\u2019t grown as much as we had anticipated. But the need for productivity has grown and our software offerings are geared to meet that need, and that\u2019s where we are seeing the growth.\nRob Painter: And Josh, just as it plays into seeing it, I think you are also asking about playing into the full Trimble financial model. One point of reference is after we announced the AGCO joint venture, when we said pro forma going forward, we would be over 70% software and 55% recurring. So, the law of the math I think should start to play through a little bit more as well.\nJoshua Tilton: Super helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, I wanted to maybe to the extent that you guys can provide it, just any more color you can give us on the churn in the Mobility segment. It feels like when we talked about it in the past, it felt more like it was isolated to that specific order and now maybe it\u2019s feeling just a tad more structural. Any more detail you guys can provide us there?\nRob Painter: I would say not structural. It would be \u2013 that would be the answer on the mobility churn.\nJoshua Tilton: No problem. Thank you.\nOperator: In the interest of time, our final question today comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nClarke Jeffries: Hello. Thank you for taking the question. In interest of time, I will keep it to one. I think David may have answered a part of this, but I wanted to kind of further clarify. When you think about the B&I portfolio and the relationship between dollar growth in moving dirt, is it fair to say that a lot of the ARR products, you can still capture opportunity when projects are going through engineering and procurement, but stop at that shovel ready stage due to the input costs. I wanted to understand as we think about maybe the next 12 months and the cyclical factors in construction, ARR versus hardware and whether if more projects come into this sort of paradigm, what part of the portfolio might outperform?\nRob Painter: I would expect broad outperformance really across the board on the ARR side of the business from the feasibility work to the design, to the engineering, to the procurement, through the earthmoving itself, the software aspects of that, that are involved in that and through the operations and maintenance. So, the overall dollar amount of work is there.\nOperator: This does bring us to the end of our Q&A session for today. I would like to thank our speakers for the presentation, and thank you all for joining us. This now concludes today\u2019s conference. Enjoy the rest of your day. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which refer to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. Simplification, focus and execution are the themes of today. I will start with a review of the third quarter, then put a Trimble lens in the current market environment we see, followed by an overview of how we are taking action to maintain our strategic and financial progression. Let's begin on Slide 2 with a review of the third quarter. The clear highlights were continued ARR growth and gross margin progression, which translated into EBITDA progression. ARR stands at a record $1.94 billion, up 25% and up 13% organically. 50% of our revenue is now recurring. Gross margin finished at a record 65%, a reflection of our Connect and Scale strategy translating into a more durable and attractive business model. EBITDA at 28% is also a record. The big strategic news of the quarter was the announcement of our joint venture with AGCO in our agriculture business. Slide 3 reviews our key messages to shareholders. The venture positions us to simplify, focus and derisk our business while deleveraging and returning capital to shareholders. As we discussed on our announcement call, the impact on pro forma 2023 numbers moves Trimble to 72% software and 55% recurring revenue. We are proud to partner with Eric Hansotia and his team at AGCO to be a global leader in mixed fleet smart farming and autonomy solutions. We expect the transaction to close in the first half of next year. And I'd like to say that we are really pleased thus far with the internal and external reaction to our partnership. In the quarter, we also divested our Landfolio business, which had approximately $10 million of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. We have now divested 18 businesses over the last 3 years and pursued a simplification and better focus to execute our strategy. Looking at the business with a global macroeconomic lens, we see increasing signs of weakness and stress across many end markets and geographies, exacerbated by interest rates, war and geopolitical tensions. These factors contribute to our updated view on the fourth quarter, which have embedded bearish and bullish signals. On the bearish side, we see the downturn in residential construction impacting our hardware businesses in both Buildings & Infrastructure and Geospatial. While we see strength in major projects, renewables and onshoring of manufacturing, we aren't seeing enough earthmoving activity to overcome this dynamic, especially in Europe. In agriculture, within resources and utilities, we see emerging signs of weakness also notably in Europe. We also expect some choppiness in the numbers as we execute our new distribution strategy in preparation for our AGCO joint venture. In transportation, I think it's safe to say that we are in a down freight market, and we've seen some trucking and technology companies either go out of business or cut back their ambitions significantly. On the bullish side, let's remember that we sell productivity, quality, safety, transparency and environmental sustainability. This is a secular value proposition. In Buildings and Infrastructure, software bookings were up more than 30%, demonstrable evidence that the strategy works and that the dollar volume of construction is healthy. Our Trimble Construction One business model framework is delivering results. We are releasing a series of customer persona-based targeted offerings and our systems enhancements are providing new levels of visibility and insight into our customers. Machine control as a service offering also exceeded bookings expectations in the quarter. In Geospatial, we continue to innovate to drive the replacement cycle and our new business models contribute to ARR growing at a double-digit rate within the surveying and mapping business. Next week, we will hold our Annual Trimble Dimensions Engineering and Construction User Conference, where thousands of industry participants will come together to learn and engage in our latest innovations. In resources and utilities, our non-ag businesses collectively grew ARR double-digits. In transportation, the shakeout in the industry will, in time, have the appropriate effect of restoring the balance in capacity and demand and bringing more discipline to the competitive landscape. Against this backdrop, we are taking action to protect our financial model, starting with a greater than $40 million run-rate cost reduction initiative as we take action to simplify and better focus our company to operate efficiently and effectively. This is in addition to cost containment initiatives that we undertook in the third quarter. We will simplify by reorganizing our operating businesses and bringing corporate resources closer to customers. For example, we have incubated our industry cloud platform work at a corporate level the last couple of years. It's now time to embed that within the business and sharpen capital allocation. We will focus by getting the right leaders in the right seats and scaling back some of our initiatives to enable the core to better deliver short and mid-term outcomes. David, over to you. I want to end the call on the same themes we started with today simplification, focus and execution. The cost action and the organizational moves we've discussed, in addition to the forthcoming Ag joint venture, all drive simplification and enhanced focus on our Connect and Scale strategy. On execution, we humbly learned from our failures and successes. We also have the confidence and conviction to manage through this economic environment. We've done this for decades, we know what we need to do, and we will stay focused on delivering productivity, quality, safety, transparency and sustainability for our customers. And we will continue to invest and innovate against our best growth opportunities. We will exit this economic downturn on a stronger competitive footing. Finally, we are announcing today that David Barnes has decided that he will retire as our CFO in May. Phil Sawarynski, our Vice President of Corporate Development, Treasurer and Co-Head of Trimble Ventures, will succeed David. David, Phil and our strong finance team will work together to ensure a smooth transition over that timeframe. I'm very grateful for having had David's steady hand over the last 4 years as we've navigated crises that neither of us ever envisioned. True character reveals itself in a crisis. David's character represents something we would all benefit from emulating. Phil comes into the role having been at Trimble for 14 years, having worked across a very diverse set of roles along the way. Phil's mandate for the role is straightforward to leverage his deep knowledge of the company to unlock shareholder value. Operator, we can now open the line to questions. Hi. Good morning, Jerry and thanks for the question. This is Rob. I'll take it. Actually, the bookings for the software businesses and construction continue to be strong in the third quarter. The ARR growth in the B&I segment was over 20% for the quarter as well in Q3. So actually, I see continued strengths into the fourth quarter with our view on ARR growth in that segment. So actually, I would say really the narrative holds there. FX is a bit of a headwind to the ARR growth that will be posted at the top line. So adjusted for that, I think we remain on track. And Jerry, if that's the macro. When I look at the micro to complement that, we have 100% customer retention and our win-loss ratios are holding. So our market share is holding in the region. I think that's important to keep in mind as well for the underlying health of the business. I'll take the second part, Rob, on the macro and what we're seeing. There is a tale of geographies embedded within that \u2013 within the answer. So I'll roughly speaking to North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Let's look at North America. You won't be surprised that sub-segments such as the data centers, the renewable energy, the onshoring and manufacturing, those are all positive catalysts. The Infrastructure Bill remains a positive catalyst. The asterisk on that one is when you compare the dollar volume within the dollars associated with infrastructure build, compared to the dirt actually moved is what we see as inflation has been eating up a fair amount of that additional spend. And then residential. For sure, we see interest rates having an impact in the residential markets. In Europe, I would say you have the same factors, but you have residential is worse than what we see in the U.S. And Asia Pacific, we see \u2013 well, not surprisingly, we see India being better. We see China being worse. You connect the China economy to a decent amount of the Australian economy, and we see some of the residential construction being slower in that market. So add those up and you have our view on the present state of construction. And let me be clear, within that is we have software businesses and we have hardware businesses. I mentioned it during the first question that we had 30% bookings increase in our construction software business in the third quarter. We had ARR growing over 20% in B&I. So there is a different behavior happening within the software business and within the hardware business. The feedback that we get from the market on that is that customers, they continue to have trouble finding qualified labor, managing that labor. They have strong overall backlog, particularly in the Americas. And so that backlog and that complexity and managing the workout in the field is a catalyst for the software adoption and that plays through into the numbers we have. So now we take the present and we map to the future, which was the other part of your question. We're essentially saying we don't see it getting better, fundamentally better, fundamentally inflecting, particularly on the residential, and that's the one probably I should comment on most discretely as our planning assumption at this point is assumed into 2024 that it doesn't get better. Of course, when interest rates come down, that will be a positive thing next year. And we know in places like here in the U.S. that we do need additional housing. So there is a dislocation, fundamental dislocation. So as the interest rates moderate, I think it's reasonable to think that, that will get better. But for now, our planning assumption, I think the smart thing to do is just assume it doesn't. Hey, Rob, that's a good question. I'll take that one. CNH continues to be an important customer and partner for Trimble and for the JV on an ongoing basis. So the nature of the agreement when we changed our approach to ag distribution and made the announcement the change in the relationship with that CNH aftermarket distribution, which we did earlier in the year. That's not a change from CNH as a customer and a partner, it really was saying we're going to \u2013 as we work with the dealers in the future, we need as part of our \u2013 through our strategy to be able to work with the dealers directly to have more of that signal of what's happening in the market and being closer to the end customer. So they have been an important customer. They are an important customer. They will be an important customer going forward, as well AGCO, obviously, through the nature of the joint venture and say, remember, we serve the mixed fleet. And that means all colors of iron, including over 100 OEMs that we work with today. So that's our view on the shape of the market. Now clearly, CNH will have an ambition set to have more of their own technology. And we know that \u2013 and you know that through the acquisitions that they have done. So in time, that will be, I'd say, a topic but let's remember that we have hundreds of thousands of units out in the machine. We have many, many farms who operate on Trimble technology, and we believe we will continue to do so in the future. So there will be some disruption as we go through the change for sure. And we expected that. That's been largely in the numbers we've had and certainly part of the conversation we had with AGCO when we establish a joint venture. I would measure it in, I'd say, some millions of dollars, like so call it in the low single-digit percentage of the disruption. But I also think that, that could very well be a timing topic. In fairness to CNH dealers, in this case, there were two announcements this year, one when at the beginning of the year, when we talked about changing the arc of the relationship; and the second was the JV announcement. So I think it is reasonable to assume that some of these dealers have taken a step back and paused and sort of hear, hey, what does this mean and where do we go. There is demand out there in the market and customers use our technology. So we believe through our new distribution strategy, the Vantage distribution strategy, that we can capture and meet that need out in the marketplace. It just may shift from, I'd say, this year into next year. Good morning, Jonathan, good question. What we hear from \u2013 well, let's talk about what we're doing and what we hear from the customers. What we hear from customers is that similar to my remarks earlier is that they are looking to work with us in a differential way. They are looking to move from delivering task productivity to system productivity. They are looking to manage the volume of work that they have and the complexity they are in. They are looking at us and saying, we want to do more business with you, Trimble. It's in the \u2013 part of the consistent theme has been make yourselves easier to do business with. And that's where Trimble Construction One is part of that \u2013 is part of delivering that. And what we see from the data is we continue to grow the cross-sells. So we look at the cross-selling on a year-over-year basis, and it's a strong double-digit increase in the amount of cross-selling. And so we can manifest that cross-selling through, think of it as the TC1 offering. TC1 is a framework agreement essentially makes it easier to buy more Trimble solutions together in that bundle. And then where we go further with those bundles is defining those at a persona-based level, a customer persona-based level. That is to say a steel fabricator could use and benefit from a set of Trimble solutions different than the mechanical contract or different than the general contract or different than the architect. And so the persona-based bundling offerings create bundles specific to those personas. And at our best, we can offer or sort of fullest manifestation of this, we can offer a good, better, best offering within those personas. And we're still, I'd say, quite early in this journey. And so that's one of the many things that gives me conviction that we've got runway to work with here in the business. Thanks for that question. I actually probably should have mentioned that during the \u2013 in the call. We actually have seen a higher level of adoption of the machine control as a service than was in our original expectations. So actually, that creates a negative delta to the top line revenue, as you know, right, for a subscription as opposed to a perpetual sales. So the adoption in the third quarter actually really year-to-date has been ahead of the expectations that we have for the business. For sure, if you think about proxy in the software world, what we've seen through the transitions we've made is not only do you make the technology more affordable in doing so, you expand the size of the addressable market. And we've seen that time and time again in the markets we've served in software as we've made these transitions. I'd like to believe that, that's a possible outcome as well in the hardware world, is that we can expand the size of the addressable market. And you think about the cost environment that we're in or that we certainly we see that we're in and we see that as a positive catalyst in that market. But I think even more interesting than that is once you're monetizing on a subscription level on the machine control side, we believe it becomes much easier to package the relevant software offerings along with it as well. And so that's a preview of where some of our next releases will go into Civil Infrastructure bundles that capture relevant Trimble software along with the hardware. And then you asked about the business model that goes with it specifically. Well, we've had two versions of it. One, you go straight subscription on the entirety of the offering. And the other one is you do a split with the hardware and the software, which is to say you'd do a nominal amount upfront for some of the hardware and then you monetize the rest of the subscription. I think we're going to see us do more of the latter over time. You can create some, I'd say, better aligned economics with the dealer channel in between when you have that upfront, a nominal amount of the hardware being sold upfront and actually also helps our cash flow ourselves as Trimble, and the customers have seemed to be reasonably indifferent of the two offerings. So that's where I think we will lean more into that one going forward. So the \u2013 well, so it's all structural is the first answer on the number. Our expectation is that we come into 2024 with that in place to build a move forward on that one. And then within the subset of the allocation, here's how I'd want to portray it as we look at the portfolio of activities and businesses that we have. First, you take our software businesses, particularly the ARR businesses that are posting the rule of 40, rule of 50 and in some cases, beyond where we've got that growth. We're going to continue to invest and grow the expenses in that, where we're driving the bookings, which drives the ARR growth. And we look at the lifetime value to the customer acquisition cost as a strong measure of where to allocate capital. On the flip side, we look at activities that have been a little further out in their nature or where the shape of the market adoption is scaling back on, where the world is scaling back on, let's say, some of the ambition set that we have. And so we will look there. So it's very ROI based in our approach. And it's very strategic based because this is not going to be just a kind of a peanut butter approach. We will move activities that we have at the corporate level closer to the businesses, for example, the industry cloud work, that we have doing and we have been \u2013 I think we did the right thing to incubate that, the company \u2013 excuse me, through the corporate level for the last couple of years. Now we can get that embedded into a business and then sharpen the allocation within the business between the work we do within the short, mid and long-term. Chad, the way I think about the software side is it certainly has proven thus far to be more resilient. Hey, with the software that you are using in Trimble, but I would say the same thing on the hardware. But the software our customers use is its mission-critical software. It's not sitting on a shelf. It's a nice to have. So, I would say as long as they have got customers have the backlog and the work and the customers have a need to digitize, the customers has a need to become more productive and more efficient and that's a good setup for the resilience of that business and I think we could trust we could create that as a mega trend happening within many industries is the digitization of the work. The other thing that drives resilience in our view is when we have been selling and when we are selling the bundled offerings, when we are working with customers in a broader and bigger way, we think that, that has us closer to the customers. As the relationships become closer, we think that, that drives continued usage of the technology over time. So, perfectly resilient, there is certainly \u2013 that can certainly be challenged at what point does that \u2013 what would it take for that to inflect. But we haven't seen it. And we look at from our gross retention, we look at the net retention ratios, we look at the cross-sell, up-sell opportunities we have. We think we are sitting on many hundreds of millions of dollars of opportunity just within the portfolio that we have. So, that makes me optimistic about the setup that we will have. Now, will the numbers grow in percentage terms as much over time while a lot of large numbers likely kicks in at some point. We are approaching \u2013 we are not just approaching $1 billion or almost at $1 billion of ARR just within the B&I segment alone. So, posting 20% ARR growth and 30% bookings growth is pretty special, and the team deserves the recognition for that. The hardware businesses, hey, the fact, brutal facts are that it is less resilient. The hardware is a book and burn business. Very little of it today is sold on a subscription basis. And yes, we would like to do more of that over time. Now, we also are in control of some of our own resilience. That is the expansion to machine types. It's geographic penetration. It's the combining the hardware and the software that we have at Trimble to drive resilience into that. So, I don't think we are just victim to the environment around us. I also think there is a lot we can control within that. And I will net that out by saying I don't think that hardware is ultimately as resilient as the software. However, I think it is as powerful as the software, because what we can uniquely do at Trimble is connect the physical and digital worlds, that ability to connect the work in the office and the field and the hardware and software is especially unique and different. Hi. Good morning Kristen. It's a good question and thanks for that. The \u2013 I would say the reality is that there is a lot of white space within the market, and we look at the peers in the construction technology space, and many of them are also continuing to grow. And so I look at the map of the collective growth of peers and the industry. And to me, the only way the math works on that is that there is a secular adoption of the technology as the industry digitizes. We know it's a greater than $1 trillion industry in construction that has historically been underserved and underpenetrated with technology and the trends around that are a positive catalyst for the adoption of technology. So, let me start with acknowledging that. Now within that, what we see is from the cross-selling that we are doing, that to me is a metric where I would call that the wallet share that says we are doing something that's unique and different and we think that nobody else can do that quite like we can. We have technology that serves the \u2013 across the AECO landscape, architects, engineers, construction and the owners. That's quite different, and that's just the software, but now bring in the hardware components that happen there. And not just the hardware that's in with B&I, but the hardware that's within survey. Because the survey ultimately is creates the digital \u2013 starts the workflow that is creating the digital model and then turning very often into a set of construction workflows from there. On the market share topic, we do believe that we are gaining share within certain market segments and certain market segments and certain customers. And I qualify that with the word certain. I would say if you could characterize customers simply put as some who buy on best of breed or some who buy best of suite. When customers are buying best of suite, I would say we are gaining share with those customers because we can offer increasingly a better native integration of that data and the workflow across the industry life cycle. And we see positive feedback and uptick for customer who are wanting to buy suites from companies. I would say for those who buy best of breed, I would say we hold our own overall. But even within that, I could say I could double-click within the construction ERP business, I would say we are clearly who gained share in the markets that we serve. I look in the architecture space, with the SketchUp product, we are going on multiple years now very, very strong double digit ARR growth and that to me would suggest, we are gaining some share in the conceptual modeling. Good question. I would give you a two-fold answer. First, I would say within the, call it, the run rate [ph] business, we have within transportation and then second is the Transporeon dynamic. Within the run rate business that we have, we have been working steadily to clearly the increase the gross margins and that we have in the business and I think to me the path that I think about was growing operating margins I go straight to the structural topic around that at the gross margin level and so to have which implies both have the products with the right eye proposition that get the right price and we got the right set of COGS that are associated with that and it's becoming more software-centric. In transportation, I want to be less dependent on the hardware. In fact, in the more long-term basis, being more hardware agnostic on the telematics side of the business, whereas hardware differentiates, truly differentiates throughout the rest of Trimble. It's less so the case with the onboard computer in that side of the business. So, that's a structural shift, right, when we can \u2013 when we really manifest more software forward, that's a structural increase in the gross margin that can flow down to the profitability of the business. And then the other way you do that as you are getting the gross margins where they need to be, and it's also managing the operating expenses along with that, so which the team has done a, I would say, a pretty good and certainly steady job of incrementing that forward for many quarters now as you noted. Now, you layer in Transporeon on top of that and that is accretive to the margins within the segment. And so if we do our job and if the market will do us some favors here and start to turn next year, then that would again be a positive catalyst for the margins in the business. Next question. Hey Jason. Thanks for the question. I would say it depends on the size of the customer between the hardware and the software. And not surprisingly, in the small to mid-market, we are doing more with the C-levels of our customers. And then I would say the bigger the customer, the more it's segmented across the company who is the economic buyer. Let me say something I think strategically your question unlocks is the nature of moving from selling more point solutions to selling connected offerings. Because what we do see happening as increasingly as you should make that shift from the point solution to the connected offering, you are doing more account-based selling. It is a fundamentally different approach on the go-to-market side of how we sell and who we sell to at our customers. So, historically you might have had \u2013 you could have had the virtual design and construction department deciding on some technology, then they are going to use. You can have field crew deciding which hardware machine control or survey kit they want to use out in the field. As we move to these bigger offerings, the nature of that is actually, the dollar amount becomes higher even as we move this to \u2013 from the perpetual over to a subscription basis. And we see it from the uplift when we see, when we can bring customers who are already subscribing to us and now who are taking bigger part of the portfolio, we see where we get a multiple uplift. But naturally, as those dollar uplifts go higher, we are starting very often to work with the different set of people within the organizations and within our customers. Now, that level often has already been using and been the customer at that ERP level because who is typically buying the ERP is going to be more of the CFO type who is buying that. So, now when you think about it, we are able to go to that person with the bigger offering. That's a different sales motion for us. And so actually, we see that as a very positive thing for us, is changing the nature of the economic buyers when we are offering a solution. Oh, I see what you are asking. That's a good question. I have to \u2013 let's say let me think more about that and come back with a more data, a fact-based answer on that. We have been looking more at the nature of the end markets that are being served and those who do more residential work or infrastructure work. I mind you, many contractors do both kinds of work. If you are a civil contractor, you are \u2013 have to be buying more Trimble software that's going to be set your business. If you are doing residential construction, you are doing more single-family construction, you are not buying a Trimble ERP. It's too big for you if you are doing that kind of residential construction. By the time you are doing multifamily, there is a set of additional technology becomes more applicable. So, probably I am answering your question now as I talk about that out loud. And Josh, just as it plays into seeing it, I think you are also asking about playing into the full Trimble financial model. One point of reference is after we announced the AGCO joint venture, when we said pro forma going forward, we would be over 70% software and 55% recurring. So, the law of the math I think should start to play through a little bit more as well. I would say not structural. It would be \u2013 that would be the answer on the mobility churn. I would expect broad outperformance really across the board on the ARR side of the business from the feasibility work to the design, to the engineering, to the procurement, through the earthmoving itself, the software aspects of that, that are involved in that and through the operations and maintenance. So, the overall dollar amount of work is there."

            "name": "David Barnes",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Let's start on Slide 4 with a review of third quarter results. Third quarter revenue of $957 million was up 8% in total and up 2% organically. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 1%, while acquisitions net of divestitures increased revenue by 5%. Subscription and recurring revenue continued to grow at a strong rate. As Rob mentioned a moment ago, the weakening macro environment adversely impacted customer sentiment and demand across all of our hardware end markets. Gross margin in the third quarter was a record 65%, up 410 basis points year-over-year, driven by an increasingly favorable business mix and the ongoing net impact of pricing and reduced input cost inflation. Adjusted EBITDA and operating margins also expanded year-over-year due to the progression in gross margins and the benefit of cost reduction actions we took early in the quarter. Net income dollars increased by 4% and earnings per share grew year-over-year to $0.68, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance range. We are very pleased with our margin performance in the third quarter, delivering strong bottom line results even in the face of a tougher macroeconomic environment. Turning now to Slide 5, I'll review in more detail our third quarter revenue trends. On this and the next few pages, I will focus on organic growth rates, excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations. ARR was up 13%, driven in part by strong bookings across our construction software businesses. Our digital platform work is enabling cross-sell of bundled solutions. Our non-recurring revenue streams, including hardware and perpetual software, contracted by 8% year-over-year and came in below our expectations. The macro environment worsened late in the quarter across many of our hardware end markets with weakening customer sentiment and propensity to invest. The impact was especially visible in Europe, where macro trends are the most difficult. From a geographic perspective, North American revenues were up 5%. In Europe, revenues were down 1%. Moving to Slide 6. Our cash flow from operations was $147 million with free cash flow of $134 million, both of which are up significantly versus prior year. Our cash flow in the quarter benefited from lower purchases of inventory, lower tax payments and higher profitability. The working capital dynamics of our business remains strong with negative net working capital. We entered the fourth quarter with $1.6 billion in backlog inclusive of ag committed backlog expected to ship before our ag JV transaction closes. We project that $1.1 billion of our backlog will be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months. We ended the quarter with leverage measured as net debt to EBITDA of 2.9x, reflecting the repayment of $115 million of net debt during the quarter and repayment of $270 million since the closing of the Transporeon acquisition. Note that we are ahead of our time line to pay-down our Transporeon debt with leverage going below 3x one quarter ahead of the commitment we made when the deal was announced. Finally, I'll repeat what Rob mentioned earlier. During the quarter, we reached an important milestone with half of our revenue now coming from recurring revenue streams. The formation of our ag JV will further accelerate our business in the direction of majority recurring revenue, making our business both more predictable and more resilient. Let's turn now to Slide 7 for additional detail on each of our reporting segments. Buildings and Infrastructure revenue was up 6%. Revenue growth was strong across our software businesses in the segment with double-digit year-over-year ARR and revenue increases at e-Builder, Viewpoint, SketchUp and Tekla. This broad-based growth reflects the success and momentum of our Connect and Scale strategy, evidenced by growing bookings, especially of larger and broader bundles. Our Civil Construction business was down year-over-year at a high single-digit rate as the demand environment weakened among dealers and end customers. Geospatial revenue was down 2%, reflecting lower demand across many survey end markets. One bright spot for our Geospatial business in the quarter was with our U.S. federal government customers, who continue to place orders well ahead of prior year levels and above our expectations earlier in the year. Resources and Utilities revenue was down 4%, reflecting both declining farmer sentiment and the impact of our distribution network changes. Revenue declines were most pronounced in Europe, which makes up the largest portion of our ag hardware business. Partially offsetting the weakness in hardware demand, we experienced double-digit segment ARR growth in Positioning Services, forestry and Cityworks. Financial results in our Transportation segment showed progression in a number of areas. Organic ARR was up at a mid-single-digit rate and margins expanded for the seventh quarter in a row. On the other hand, our mobility business in North America has not seen the uptick in bookings that we originally expected. With planned chart notifications in the quarter, our Transportation segment ARR momentum will moderate going into next year. Transporeon top line trends remain below our expectations when we bought the business, driven almost entirely by a contraction in overall industry shipment volumes and the depressed spot market. Importantly, we have maintained our customers and our market share. And with our transaction-based recurring model, we are positioned to recover with an improvement in the overall European goods economy when the inevitable upswing takes place. The Transporeon team has managed costs well in this tough environment, and our operating margin since the deal closed remained in line with our original expectations. Moving to Slide 8, I will now discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our third quarter results reflect a weakening demand environment. We expect this weakness to extend through the fourth quarter and into next year. We now project fourth quarter revenue between $890 million and $930 million. Our fourth quarter outlook reflects 13% growth in ARR, offset by a decline in our hardware and perpetual software at a low to mid-single-digit rate. This yields a full year revenue outlook of $3.76 billion to $3.80 billion. A significant majority of the reduction in revenue outlook is in our hardware businesses with the biggest impact in Civil Construction Hardware. For perspective, it is helped to look back to the pre-COVID period to determine the underlying long-term trends of our hardware businesses. All three of our core hardware businesses, Geospatial, Agriculture and Civil Construction, have grown at a compound rate of mid-single digit or better since 2019, and our fourth quarter guidance reflects a continuation of this long-term trend. We project that the combined impact of higher gross margins and lower operating expense versus our prior outlook will offset much of the impact of our lower revenue forecast, resulting in an EPS range for the fourth quarter of $0.55 to $0.63. Our updated full year guidance for EPS is $2.58 to $2.66. Fourth quarter operating margins are projected to be in the range of 24.5% to 25%, a meaningful improvement from year ago levels, but sequentially down from the third quarter, driven primarily by mix. Within the overall outlook for the fourth quarter, we anticipate the following segment trends. Buildings and Infrastructure will remain our strongest segment with organic revenue in the quarter accelerating from third quarter levels to the mid- to high single digits. Even in the current macro environment, we see strong demand for our software offerings, while our hardware businesses are expected to be down at a mid-single-digit rate. Geospatial segment revenues are expected to be down at a low to mid-single-digit rate in the fourth quarter. Gradual improvement across some areas of our core field survey business will be offset by lower sales in the fourth quarter to the U.S. federal government. Geospatial margins in the fourth quarter will come down sequentially from third quarter levels due to a less favorable business mix. Resources and Utilities revenue are expected to be flat to down at a low single-digit rate. This fourth quarter outlook reflects both the adverse overall demand environment and the impact of our ongoing aftermarket dealer network transition. ARR growth in the segment will remain at a strong double-digit level. Transportation segment revenues will be flat or down modestly as the impact of higher customer churn in our North American mobility business offsets the growth across the rest of our transportation offerings. This outlook assumes no meaningful improvement in Transporeon's core European transportation market in the fourth quarter. From a cash flow perspective, we expect full year 2023 free cash flow in the range of $530 million to $555 million. Excluding the impact of full year transaction-related and restructuring-related cash outflows of approximately $100 million, this outlook represents free cash flow of approximately 1x net income. With our strong year-to-date cash flow performance and with contractual certainty on the upcoming close of our Ag JV transaction, we plan to reinitiate share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Consistent with past practice, we plan to issue guidance for 2024 at our fourth quarter earnings release in February. At this point, our outlook for next year can be characterized threefold. First, we expect that organic revenue growth trends will be better than those we posted this year as our hardware business has stabilized following the declines of 2023 and as recurring revenue sources make up a growing proportion of our total revenue base. Second, we believe ARR will continue to grow at a double-digit rate. Even in the context of a tough macro environment, our bookings and net retention performance continue to support this outlook. Third, with the cost reduction actions we are taking, we expect to hold or improve EBITDA margins even with the impact of the close of our AGCO deal. This outlook leaves us on track to achieve the EBITDA margin goals we put forward in our Investor Day last year. Rob, I'll turn it back over to you. Thanks, Jerry. Yes, hey, Jerry the changes in ARR growth, we're talking tens of basis points. The big story is that the growth is sustained as Rob said, bookings are really good. There's no fundamental change in the momentum of our B&I ARR business. Yes. Sure, Jerry. I'll reiterate the comments in the prepared remarks. Our margin trends are very strong. We think sequentially, Q4 won't look quite as good as Q3. We had \u2013 that's a mix issue, both between software and hardware and within the hardware part of our portfolio. But fundamentally, our margin story is really good. And we've taken actions to manage our operating expense very carefully. Actually, that started early this year. Rob mentioned that we're going to move even further here in Q4. Our goal is looking into next year to be in a position where we can maintain or grow our EBITDA margins. And I'll point out that we're \u2013 that includes the impact of the creation of the Ag JV. And if you go back to the financial remarks we had when we made that announcement, we said the creation of the JV puts downward pressure of 70 basis points on our EBITDA margin. We're looking to cover that. So yes, margin is a great story. Obviously, the top line on the hardware part of our business has been softer than we anticipated. But the margin story is even better, and that's something we are carefully managing looking into next year. Yes. So as you can imagine, we're \u2013 we have visibility every day to a very significant portion of the European transportation market. I think I'd characterize it as stabilizing after a very weak period over \u2013 after the last three or four quarters, well, since we bought the business. We're not declaring a turnaround yet. But if you look at the metrics of transportation volumes, spot pricing, capacity utilization, not necessarily getting better, but it stopped getting worse. So we can see the stabilization and over time, very hard to predict exactly when. But over time, those will recover and with our transaction-based ARR model, the business will recover with it. So it's stabilizing. It's still the freight market in Europe. And I think in America, you characterize it as in recession, particularly some of the end markets. Actually, we can see by part of the economy what's weak, where there is fewer trucks on the road, shipping goods. But construction equipment, paper and packaging are way down versus last year, reflecting the overall macroeconomic weakness. So we think we've stabilized. That's the basis of our fourth quarter, and we will plan for some improvement looking into next year, but we will be cautious, given the magnitude of the drop that occurred over the last three quarters. Hey, Rob, it's David. I'll take the dealer inventory question first. We did see a very meaningful inventory destock in the first half of this year, particularly in the first quarter. You probably recall, I said we estimate it was about $40 million in the first quarter, less than that in the second quarter. It's not really a factor in the back half of this year. Actually, in some of our end markets, dealer inventory went up by just a little bit in Q3. The one change we're seeing, and Rob referenced this in his remarks, is that on the civil side, we're seeing the set point, the desired inventory level for our dealers has actually come down. That reflects higher interest rates, so higher cost of carrying inventory. It reflects the uncertainty about the demand market and frankly, our very good product supply. So the need to hold inventory is less than it was. So that won't be helpful to us. I think we will see a modest correction. Nowhere near like Q1 and Q4. We're talking in the $10 million to $20 million range. But we think dealer inventories in aggregate are close to where they will be over the longer-term. Hey, Rob, it's David Barnes. I'll take that. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that bookings are coming in soft in our North American mobility business in transportation and we received notification turn that will occur going forward. So our \u2013 while our ARR has been looking better recently, we do think that will \u2013 the churn we have in our North American mobility business will adversely affect transportation ARR growth in Q4 and going into next year by somewhere around 200 basis points. Now I'll emphasize that the rest of the transportation ARR base is doing really well. Our Maps business is growing ARR at double-digit rate, even Transporeon were growing ARR. Our enterprise business is growing ARR. Actually, our mobility business in Europe and in Brazil is good. So the North American mobility business represents about quarter of transportation ARR, and that \u2013 the trends there are going to be more adverse. So the sort of core base outlook is for transportation, ARR growth to be adversely impacted by a couple of hundred basis points going forward because of the churn dynamic in North American mobility. Hi Josh, it's David. First of all, I would say that we are seeing that in the software business where Rob mentioned the 30%-plus bookings in our construction software business, ARR is still really strong, growing at 20%. So, that business is benefiting from the clear path to value and Rob mentioned labor constraints that our construction customers have and software technology being needed. The hardware side is more \u2013 I will point out within B&I, our hardware is sold to civil contractors, so it's a more narrow range of customers then buy our software. And the sale of our hardware for that segment is driven by, to use Rob's, moving dirt. And while the infrastructure dollars are going up, if you take the inflation and back that out, labor and materials cost inflation, the actual amount of dirt being moved has not risen much over time, and that's the fundamental driver of our B&I hardware business. So, the demand of the actual \u2013 for technology to moving the earth isn't \u2013 hasn't grown as much as we had anticipated. But the need for productivity has grown and our software offerings are geared to meet that need, and that's where we are seeing the growth."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Second Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Painter, please go ahead.\nRob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons which will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. Let's begin on slide 2 with our key messages. Annualized recurring revenue is our key top line metric at Trimble. Our team, led by our construction software group, achieved 14% organic growth in the quarter, beating our internal expectations by 100 basis points. We now stand at a record $1.88 billion of ARR, which compares to $1.2 billion when we began our Connect and Scale journey in 2020. ARR has doubled since 2018 and tripled since 2015. We are on track to achieve $2 billion of ARR by the end of the year, a remarkable figure made possible by the Trimble team who continues to work incredibly hard to execute on our customer-driven systems, process and business model transformation. We delivered EBITDA margin of 25.3%, also slightly ahead of our expectations, which was driven by strong gross margin of 64.2%. For perspective, gross margin was 56.8% in 2015 and 58% in 2018. EPS at $0.64 and year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate to net income of nearly 100% demonstrates the power and potential of our asset-light business model. Our revenue beat in the quarter is attributable to delivering a large federal government order in the geospatial business in the second quarter instead of the third quarter. For the year, we are holding our revenue guidance and raising EPS. Moving to slide 3. Let's look at the progression of our Connect and Scale strategy through the lens of our reporting segments, beginning with Buildings & Infrastructure. The market backdrop remains generally favorable. In North America, we see strength in infrastructure and non-residential construction. Customer backlogs remain healthy and technology helps to address the skilled worker shortage. By the numbers, ACV bookings accelerated on a sequential basis, and we achieved a record level of bookings in the quarter. ARR grew over 20%. Our Trimble Construction One offering is achieving higher win rates, larger deal sizes and shorter sales cycles. Further, it is helping to grow both new logo and cross-sell bookings. We are confident in our ability to maintain momentum as our most recent release of digital systems upgrades provides significantly enhanced visibility to even further drive cross-sell and upsell. Strategically, we are pivoting more of our hardware offerings to adopt aspects of the subscription business model. For example, in building construction layout, our RI layout instrument is only available as a subscription. In civil construction, we have shifted more value to the software on the systems offering, thereby positioning us to reduce the upfront cost of a system and monetize over the life of the customer. In geospatial, the market backdrop is largely the same as buildings and infrastructure, yet serving a more highly penetrated customer base. By the numbers, revenue was well ahead of our internal expectations in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand from US state departments of transportation. And in the quarter, our team delivered the aforementioned federal government order. Strategically speaking, we saw ARR growth in our Trimble Catalyst product line. Catalyst offers precision positioning-as-a-service through a subscription offering. We passed the milestone this quarter with over 10,000 cumulative units shipped. We also expanded our product line in the reality capture space with the launch of our X9 scanner. We see reality capture as an important product category as it creates a key linkage between the physical and digital worlds, which we can uniquely serve. In Resources and Utilities, farmer sentiment has been trending negative despite market fundamentals such as commodity prices, largely continuing to be healthy. Our strategic focus in agriculture continues to be building out our aftermarket channel to gain dealer and customer intimacy, thereby providing farmers choice in their technology platforms. While revenue was down as expected, ARR grew at a double-digit rate. Our Positioning Services business continues to win customers in both on-road and off-road capacities, demonstrating our ability to innovate in the space of positioning technologies after 45 years in the business. We also took strategic steps to further ongoing ARR growth. In Forestry, we launched a cloud-based log inventory and management system that enables us to move down market, thereby expanding the addressable market. And in Utilities, the team delivered two of the largest software bookings in the history of the business. In Transportation, the market backdrop remains challenging with the soft freight market pressuring carriers to streamline their operations for cost savings to increase asset utilization and to increase the productivity of their nondriver workforce. Against this backdrop, the overall business both increased operating income margin for six consecutive quarters and grew organic ARR for the seventh consecutive quarter. In Europe, in our Transporeon business, we see early indications that the spot market might have bottomed out. Despite a difficult economic backdrop in Europe, churn is effectively zero, competitive win rates increased and the business is demonstrating an ability to manage the cost structure in line with the revenue environment. We have early examples of success with bringing the organizations together and making some product road map decisions to streamline product development work. Moving to Slide 4. Connect and Scale is a platform strategy, which in turn is fundamentally a vertical industry data strategy. No surprise then that we have been deploying artificial intelligence across Trimble for some time now, both for internal benefits and customer-facing applications. For example, a trial program with over 200 engineers using AI-assisted programming demonstrated upwards of 25% improvement in productivity. We have also extended AI into our sales process, where we are applying AI to the cost scripts of our sales reps to coach them and then further, again, to identify cross-sell opportunities. On the customer-facing front, we are improving our best-in-class positioning accuracy in harsh environments using AI-based error modeling and machine learning on many years of atmospheric data. We are deploying AI and video intelligence solutions in transportation to detect driver fatigue and distraction and for selective spraying applications in agriculture. In our construction software business, we are automating invoices by converting PDF data into usable accounts payable data. We've already processed over 350,000 invoices worth over $1 billion, compelling use cases and we are just beginning. Let me now turn the call over to David, to take us through the numbers.\nDavid Barnes: Turning now to slide 5 second quarter revenue of $994 million grew three percent organically. Revenue was above our expectations coming into the quarter, driven by the earlier-than-expected shipment of the large order of Geospatial equipment to the Federal Government that Rob mentioned earlier. Excluding that, revenues for the quarter were in-line with our projections. Our total company revenue growth versus prior year was driven by recurring software, both organic and from the addition of Transporeon. Gross margins were strong again in the second quarter, with non-GAAP gross margins of 64.2% tying the record levels of the first quarter. Our gross margins in the second quarter reflect favorable price/cost dynamics, strong growth of recurring software revenues and a higher margin mix within our product offerings. EBITDA margin of 25.3% in the second quarter was up 110 basis points year-over-year, benefiting from our strong gross margin performance. Operating and EBITDA margins continue to grow versus prior year, even as we lap strong year-ago revenues and as we continue to invest in our digital transformation. Cash flow in the second quarter improved on a year-over-year basis even taking into account Transporeon deal-related expenses. Our improved cash flow performance was the result of lower purchases of inventory, lower tax payments, and higher profitability. Our capital allocation priority remains debt repayment. And we made progress through the quarter on reducing our leverage. Turning now to, slide 6 for some additional color on our revenue performance. Product revenue, which includes both hardware and perpetual software, was down 5% organically in the second quarter and was aided by the federal order, which we had previously expected to ship in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline in product revenue this quarter reflects a difficult comparison with the second quarter of 2022, when our supply chain was freeing up and we were working through high hardware backlog. As expected, dealers reduced their inventories in the quarter. We expect some modest amount of additional dealer inventory reduction over the balance of this year. Our subscription and services revenue, which includes SaaS, term licenses, maintenance and support, recurring transactions and professional services, was up 13% on an organic basis, largely driven by strong bookings and net retention performance across our Buildings and Infrastructure software businesses. From a geographic perspective, revenues in North America, Asia Pacific and the Rest of World were up organically, by 3%, 11% and 18% respectively. Rest of World revenue growth was driven by strong demand for precision agriculture products from customers in Brazil. Revenues in Europe declined organically by 4%, as adverse macroeconomic factors impacted many of our businesses. Turning now to results by segment on slide 7, our software portfolio in the Buildings and Infrastructure reporting segment, continued to perform well, with organic ARR growth of over 20%. Bookings of recurring software offerings in the segment grew at a mid-20s percentage rate, despite the challenges of transitioning the North American software businesses onto our new digital infrastructure during the quarter. These large system implementations are never easy, but our teams powered through the transition, while still keeping our growth momentum going. With this latest release of our digital transformation, we now have over one-third of our Buildings and Infrastructure ARR, transacting through a connected system, which will facilitate the acceleration of our Connect and Scale strategy. Segment revenues of products for civil construction customers were down at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, reflecting strong shipment momentum a year ago. In the Geospatial reporting segment, we experienced organic revenue growth driven by the $18 million shipment to the federal government mentioned earlier. Excluding this one shipment, segment revenues in the quarter were down at a mid-single-digit organic rate, an improvement from the performance in the first quarter. This segment is most impacted by the downturn in residential home construction in North America and Europe. We expect to return to organic growth on an ongoing basis in the fourth quarter. In the Resources and Utilities segment, revenues were down year-on-year and fell modestly short of our expectations, driven by our agriculture business. While our sales to ag OEM customers grew versus prior year in the second quarter, revenue from our aftermarket channel was down. Three drivers help contextualize the aftermarket revenue decline. One, we are lapping a tough comp versus 2022 when our revenues surged as our supply chain freed up well ahead of the OEM supply chain. Second, the changes we announced a quarter ago and our aftermarket distribution network have, as expected, impacted our short-term revenue trends as we and our dealers refine our plans going forward. And third, we are seeing the impact from a softening of farmer sentiment, especially in Europe. We continue to see strong demand trends from ag customers in Brazil, and our positioning services business grew globally at a double-digit rate as we accelerated our cross-sell efforts. In the Transportation segment, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, driven by our North American Enterprise and Maps businesses. Our Mobility businesses in Europe and Brazil also grew revenue and ARR at a double-digit rate. As Rob mentioned earlier, operating margins improved sequentially once again. Our Trimble transportation team has made good progress in turning this business around. And while there's more work ahead of us, we are pleased with the progress. I'll note here that segment results now include the Transporeon business. Transporeon performance was largely in line with our expectations for the quarter, notwithstanding a tough macro environment in the European transportation industry. Moving now to Slide 8. We ended the second quarter with ARR of $1.88 billion, up 14% organically. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, our backlog, stood at $1.6 billion at the end of the quarter. RPO related to recurring offerings grew by over $100 million year-over-year as a result of our strong bookings performance. Product RPO came down as expected year-over-year, reflecting our improved lead times. With this high level of RPO, we have significant visibility into our revenue in the coming quarters. On a 12-month rolling basis, our software services and recurring revenue of $2.3 billion represents a record 64% of our revenues, up 800 basis points from year ago levels. We completed the acquisition of Transporeon in the second quarter and reduced net debt by $150 million from the closing of the acquisition through quarter end. We plan to continue to delever, and as anticipated, expect to finish the year with net debt less than 3x EBITDA. Turning now to our guidance on Slide 9. The midpoint of our guidance for full year revenue remains the same as we issued last quarter. Our revenue guidance range has narrowed to $3.845 billion to $3.925 billion, which represents organic revenue growth in the second half of the year in the mid- to high single digits. We continue to expect ARR to grow at a mid-teens rate for the year. Our expectation for gross and operating margins has increased from prior guidance by 50 basis points, reflecting the strong performance in the second quarter and highly focus on margins and cost control. The end result is an increase in the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance range by $0.03. We now expect full year EPS in the range of $2.57 to $2.73. From a segment perspective, our expectation for full year growth in the Buildings and Infrastructure segment has improved following strong performance in the second quarter. Our forecast in Resources and Utilities is down modestly from the outlook of a quarter ago, reflecting weakening macroeconomic conditions in the agriculture sector. The outlook for Transportation and Geospatial is unchanged from last quarter. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect organic revenue growth in the range of 0% to 5%, which corresponds with a revenue range of $945 million to $985 million. We expect gross margins of 100 to 150 basis points lower than the second quarter, reflecting a less favorable business mix. We expect third quarter operating margins will be similar to second quarter levels. We project EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.64. From a segment perspective, we expect Geospatial revenues to be down organically at a mid-to-high single-digit rate as we won't have the positive impact of the large federal order this coming quarter. Resources and Utilities revenue is expected to be down at a mid-single digit organically. Revenue in Buildings and Infrastructure and Transportation are expected to continue to grow organically in the third quarter at rates comparable to or better than we experienced in the second quarter. Back to you, Rob.\nRob Painter: The Trimble operating system links strategy, people and execution with a belief set that we must strive for excellence across all three dimensions. The progress of the quarter represents the quality of the strategy and our ability to execute. I'll close with comments on people. In the quarter, we won a number of culture awards, reinforcing our ability to attract the best talent in the industry. We believe that part of attracting the best lies in developing the best talent of the future. Through our Trimble Labs initiative, we now sponsor 30 technology labs in 14 countries. We also believe in the health of our communities. In the quarter, we announced breaking ground on a 1.7 megawatt solar array as a renewable energy source at our headquarters, and our own technology is currently being utilized to increase the productivity and quality of this installation. Finally, let me take a moment to acknowledge that Steve Berglund retired from our Board of Directors, completing over 24 years of service at Trimble. We thank Steve for all of his contributions, dedication and years of service to the company. Borje Ekholm will Chair our Board of Directors through our next phase of growth. Operator, let's open the line to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer.\nKristen Owen: Hi. Good morning thank you for taking the question and congratulations on a nice result. I was wondering if we could maybe start by just some of the moving pieces in Resources and Utilities. David, I think you called out this three items, but wondering if you can help us parse out sort of the macro from the distribution channel, what you're seeing in underlying demand there? And then walk us through how that transition is unfolding in the distribution channel?\nDavid Barnes: Sure. Hi Kristen. First thing I'll point out is that our business with the OEMs was up. So that's the good part of the story. The factors that I mentioned that caused our aftermarket business to be down year-on-year, a part of it is the macros. We see softening sentiment across many of the geographies is much more pronounced in Europe than the rest of the world, but we really see it in Europe. We've also changed our -- made announcement of changes to our distribution network. And so that's causing us and our dealers to sort of rethink our plans, and that clearly had a softening effect in the quarter. And then, we're just lapping really big numbers. Last year, we had really strong shipments as we were working through our supply chain. I'll point out our supply chain improved much more quickly than the OEMs. They get a lot more parts, more complex supply chain. So we saw the surge last year. It's a little tough to attribute, the causal nature of the aftermarket revenue decline to those three. It is a mix, and some of them are interrelated. But I think overall, the sort of long-term outlook remains positive, just as it was. We see these as -- all three of these factors is reasonably temporal.\nKristen Owen: Okay. Thank you. And just to clarify, on the transition in the distribution network, just any thoughts on how that is playing out at this point and how we should think about the impact from that transition over the remainder of the year?\nRob Painter: Hey Kristen. Good morning, it's Rob. The transition is playing out mostly as expected. So, we feel good about where we are in this. It's obviously a process as we go around the globe, but we take an 80-20 principle as we work with our partners around the world from those that we're signing up. Thus far, I think there's very positive sentiment. This creates a closer connection to Trimble. It gets a broader portfolio of technology to take to market. So we're feeling good about it where we are, and there's still clearly a lot of work to be done. So I'd say, largely as expected so far.\nKristen Owen: That's super helpful. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about a comment that you made regarding the positioning services. Can you just remind us what is your market share in positioning services today as we think about maybe specific to RNU just given the cross-selling opportunities that you called out there? Just trying to think about what the overall TAM is just given your market penetration? And I'll stop there. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Yes, this has been an extraordinarily successful business for us really for the last couple of -- I can argue in the last couple of decades. To get that 2-centimeter and less accuracy on a farm or for a survey or for construction equipment, by the way, for ADAS systems and on-road vehicles, you need to have corrections, because you have errors in the atmosphere, you need additional geometry -- ground-based geometry to augment the satellites. So we've been a market leader, a technology leader in this capability for a long time now, continue to actually find ability to innovate in this space. From a market share perspective, I'd say it's pretty clear, we're the market leader as our technology goes on in ag, it goes civil construction equipment and machine control, it shows up in surveying all places where we have the market share lead. So the correlation on to Trimble equipment correlates to the market share we have, I'd say, and beyond because you don't just have to be Trimble on Trimble and we are mixed fleet. On the on-road space, that became a new frontier, let's say, a new addressable market that opened up for us in the last few years as automotive companies start towards their path -- towards autonomy. It's a series of progressive automation. That's why you see ADAS picking up as one of the first applications. So to no absolute position for lane detection, you're going to need to have corrections like we have. So, that's an emerging market with -- that presents an expanded addressable market for us. In terms of actually sizing specifically the addressable market, I have to admit it's a bit hard to do that, but I would put it as a certainly approaching $1 billion type market opportunity when you put the on-road business in as well.\nKristen Owen: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich : Yes. Hi, good morning everyone.\nRob Painter : Hi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich : Rob, I'm wondering if you could just share a bit more of the stats for the subscription businesses. I know you have a very tight pipeline process, particularly in B&I, can you just talk about what the pipeline looks like? And any comments that you can add on Transporeon's performance beyond the prepared remarks in terms of what the lead indicators look like in that item business? And if you're willing to touch on new logo growth for the subscription assets within the performance, we would appreciate it? Thanks.\nRob Painter : Sure, Jerry. So the pipeline within construction is quite strong. This team is firing on all cylinders at the moment. It showed up in the organic ARR growth greater than 20%, which is clearly better than the company number at the plus 14% level organically. Bookings were grew faster than the ARR growth. Bookings grew sequentially. You'd asked me about that last quarter. So now you work backwards from the bookings and into the pipeline and the coverage ratios, and we like what we see. We see strong pipeline, strong coverage ratios, the Trimble construction one offering continues to get momentum for our sellers in the market. We see strong cross-sell activity within those bookings as the pieces come together quite nice and overlay the market backdrop on that, and infrastructure in North America is clearly a positive catalyst for us in all of the markets. So generally, a favorable macro meets a team executing extremely well and turns into a pipeline, which turns into that ARR. On the Transporeon side of the house, we're four months into the acquisition. So it's still relatively new. We like what we're seeing in the business so far. So as I think about the people, I think about the macros, I think about the business and I think about the integration opportunities that we have there. Now the macro is still more challenging in Europe. It's a mass micro monetization business model. So it's fundamentally transaction-based or consumption-based and then the nature of the mix of that consumption impacts the revenue. What we think we saw in the quarter is that it looks like spot prices might have hit a bottom and time will tell. If that's the case, then the business model is there and poised to increase accordingly. From a customer perspective, from wins in the market, we don't lose customers in this business. We did have new logo wins in the quarter, continue to have bookings growth in the quarter. So I like the start that we have in the business.\nJerry Revich: Super. Thank you for the detail color. And David, can I ask on the fourth quarter revenue outlook growth, really interesting, so essentially an acceleration in sales of about three points ahead of normal seasonality, 4Q versus 3Q. Can you just unpack what gives you that confidence because Caterpillar is cutting production and we've got a bit of different trends in some of your hardware markets? I'm wondering if you could just talk about the visibility that you have because that element of your guide looks pretty interesting.\nDavid Barnes: Yeah, sure. Jerry, one thing I'll say is that if you compare Trimble's trends with the OEMs, you have to keep in mind the year-on-year comps, including channel inventory, which are completely different for us. We work through our supply chain issues. In early last year, we saw the surge of shipment. Our channel inventories have been declining. That's not true for all the OEMs. The way I get comfort on the fourth quarter is from a couple of directions. First, from the bottom-up look at the businesses, the pipeline, the underlying trends. And then from a top-down perspective, I look at comparisons of our projections with the period before COVID in the supply chain. If you actually look at our organic growth going back to four years ago, so which is pre these disruptions. Actually, the fourth quarter compound organic growth is very comparable to Q3 and is actually consistent with what we've seen for several quarters. So it looks like a ramp-up, but when you take the noise of the supply chain-driven ups and downs from a year or two ago, it looks very achievable. So we're very confident in this fourth quarter outlook.\nJerry Revich: Super. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next call comes from Mr. Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nChad Dillard: Hi. Good morning guys. So I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more into the hardware business. Can you just talk about segment by segment, what you're seeing in terms of the year-on-year slowdown? And then also, can you talk about the progress of destocking, to what extent do you think you're going to be finished and when you think you'd be able to produce in line with retail demand?\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Chad. First thing I'd say is that we're nearly all the way through the destocking. It won't be a meaningful factor for the back half of the year. There was some destocking in Q2. It was much smaller than Q1, so I don't really call that out as a major driver. But there's a -- it's not just the destocking this year. It was the increase in inventory levels last year that you're comparing against. So you've got to put those two together to compare our business trends with retail demand. And that's true across the markets we serve. From the segment perspective, the business where we think there has been some end user sales to retail or sales end user decline is in geospatial. That is the segment that is most impacted by residential construction, both in the United States and Europe. So that's been the softest. If you take the channel dynamics out both this year and last and the other businesses in ag and in civil construction, it looks like there's modest sales to retail growth even with the numbers we're posting. So that's kind of how we see it.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. And then I wanted to hit on your digital transformation. Can you just talk about how that's progressing? I think you talked about B&I, about 30 of your products are being sold this way. Maybe you can talk also about just what you've learned so far with that one-third of that business segment being transformed?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. So we got through the next phase of our digital transformation during Q2. We put our North American construction enterprise software businesses together on a common digital platform. And as I said in my prepared remarks, these big process and system changes are never easy, they can be disruptive. One of the things I'm most proud of with our team and our results is that we achieved nearly mid-20s-plus -- actually, and the businesses directly impacted by the digital transformation, almost 30% bookings growth, while the tools they use to track and sell have transformed. So that is a huge milestone. It's -- we are now in a position, only just now, to take advantage of the benefits that the common platform provides to us and further enhancements to that are going to roll out even this quarter. So we're getting to the point where cross-sell and the Connect and Scale vision is enabled and not hindered by diversity of systems. Now we have common technology. We have visibility into our pipeline. Salespeople can see what customer business is across the Trimble portfolio in ways that they couldn't systematically before. So we're just getting going. We're just beginning to realize the potential of this new process and tool for that business, and we will continue over the next year or two to roll out the same approach to the rest of our business.\nChad Dillard: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please go ahead. \nJonathan Ho: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to start with TC1. And can you maybe give us a little bit of additional color in terms of how this is maybe impacting your ability to transact with customers as well as where TC1 maybe has surprised you?\nRob Painter: Hey, Jonathan. Good morning. It's Rob. The TC1 so far has been, I'd say, a large success, and I think we're just getting started with it. I've had an example of a customer saying, okay, I used to have to have 14 different transactions with you to do business and now I can do it under one frame agreement. We're making ourselves easier to do business with. When we sign a frame agreement, let's say, with a customer who maybe is only buying one solution within TC1, if you sign the frame agreement, it's now easier to upsell. So that land and expand is more easily enabled because you don't have to go back and with a set of terms and conditions. Customers are able to connect workflows as we have tighter and tighter integrations in the data across the products and solutions that we sell to customers. So any surprise within TC1 to me as to the upside, it absolutely validates Connect and Scale and as the beacon for the rest of the company of what we can do when we rethink how we go to market and how we take our solutions to market. So I was very encouraged with what we're seeing in the business and proud of the team that's delivering it.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. And you also mentioned AI during the prepared remarks. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of how this could be a potential driver of revenue, the timeframes for that as well as on the productivity side? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Certainly, let's split the two and then the slide that goes along with the prepared remarks that we made on purpose, put one distinction of the internal facing example separate from the customer-facing examples. So if we take the productivity opportunity internally, I think the place we'll see it show up first is within the R&D on the developer side with the copilot trial that we ran in the second quarter that showed some productivity benefits. I think this is going to be the way that business has done. So where I would like to believe that, we'll see this show up over time as we can get more scalability out of the resources we have. Said another way is, if this works, that turns into op leverage on revenue growth that we have in the future. So call it more scalability, more effectiveness -- and internal effectiveness and efficiency, which I think would ultimately manifest in op leverage or that marginal contribution on the revenue growth. On the customer-facing side, I think it's going to be very interesting to see how this monetizes over time. Right now, I would say, there's an aspect where we make the solutions we sell better. Trimble is a premium price provider in the market. I think this is part of earning that premium is continuing to innovate and develop and have the best. There's another aspect of capabilities, which we believe will come through when you're buying a bundle such as TC1 when you're buying that platform offering or that cloud offering, such that if you have a, I'll say, an incremental set of analytics capabilities, we want to deliver them when you're buying something like TC1, so where you can uniquely get them by virtue of that business model. I suspect that that's going to be the way that we'll see this monetize. I think standalone analytics, I have a question if those will actually be able to monetize independently and on their own. I really think it comes through making our solutions better.\nJonathan Ho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. So on Trimble Construction One, can you give us some color on what percent of your B&I customers now have TC1 and using multiple solutions on it? And do you have any set goal or timeframe to convert a certain percent of the customer base into TC1 customers?\nRob Painte: Hi, Tami, good morning, it's Rob. Let's take that in here slices within B&I. Within B&I, you know, we have the civil construction -- fundamentally, we have the civil construction business, machine control, as you would know it, and then the construction software. Within the civil construction business, we don't -- we really don't have TC1 today, but that is absolutely where we're going. It's connecting the machine control offering with the software. We do that informally today, like that's the path we'll for sure be going. So I'd say we're not fundamentally doing it in the civil space today. So there would be no customers that we're hitting there. Within the construction software business that we have, this is for sure where we're taking the business and where we're having success. I have one caveat within that, which is our SketchUp product in our architecture and design business because SketchUp has millions of users from makers to architects. And so it's a different market segment. So I don't think that the millions of users of SketchUp are going to all be relevant for TC1. So if I take it within the subset the construction software, we would have an ambition to have, it's well more than half of our customer base on the Trimble Construction One agreement. We've got many thousands of customers on the frame agreements today. The team does a great job even if somebody is not buying a full bundled opportunity that they're putting them on the frame -- customers on the frame agreement such that they have a path to have access to more of our solutions and to have more of those more easily. So I hope that gives you a little color on how we think about the TC1 opportunity within B&I. What we'll continue to do, I guess I'll have a little bit more Tami, is our sweet spot today is at that contractor level with the TC1 offering, then we look at an architecture and engineering experience for TC1. We look at a civil contractor experience for TCI. So I have a series of expansions through tailoring experiences to the customer segments that we serve and then actually also rolling this out on a global basis. So overall, we're still in the early innings, and that's good news in terms of the continued growth opportunity.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. That's very helpful color, Rob. Thank you. And my follow-up question is the price cost benefit in the quarter that you saw that helped gross margin, can you quantify how much it was and what segments drove that?\nRob Painter: Yes. I mean just to give you a little higher level color on that for the moment. So the qualitative before quantitative. On the qualitative side, the gross margin improvement is fundamentally about the mix of the software business. So this isn't a price, I'll say, a price-driven benefit where we also see benefit in the margin as from the cost abating the inflation coming down in the supply chain, purchase price variance is going down or going away. So that means the hardware businesses are returning to increase their gross margins, by and large. You put that on top of selling more software, which comes naturally with a higher gross margin, and you get that 64.2% gross margin, which was a time of record we had from Q1 and is a remarkable change from gross margins of the past at Trimble. So it's more -- much more driven by that than price.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead. \nRob Mason: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could -- speaking to maybe the B&I and geospatial areas collectively, could you segment out what you're seeing between infrastructure and trends in non-res construction? And then just with respect to residential construction, do you think you're at a point of stabilization there?\nRob Painter: Hi, Rob. Good morning. If we look at the segments within the market, clearly, infrastructure is the strong point, both, I'd say, North America, but also globally. There's also mega projects happening around the world and those are positives for us. On the, I'll say, the non-res side, if I exclude infrastructure non-res where we see pockets of -- continue to see pockets of strength and if I think here in North America, I think about renewable energy projects, we think about some onshoring of manufacturing, data centers, which correlates to AI, we believe, those are areas where we're seeing strength. And residential specifically, there's a little bit of a mixed tail. There's still a fair amount of new homebuilding happening, I'll stay within the US here for a bit on residential. But -- and so we see sort of up and down trends on that. I mean, it's been net down on residential, for sure. And hopefully, we can get to some stabilization on that. I don't know that I would call it stabilized yet in North America. But the economy looks like we might be able to head for us if we had for that soft landing, then that would be a good thing. Residential has been harder in Europe and then, that one have much more of a challenge than the US, and that's worth calling out. So you put the sum of that all together, and you get the forecast what -- we get the results that we have and the forecast that we put going forward.\nRob Mason: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, David, you did -- I know we just had the discussion around gross margin. But David, you did speak to some -- that steps down in the third quarter. Should we expect that it steps back up in the fourth the mix becomes more favorable again?\nDavid Barnes: Yeah, Rob, it will -- it's mostly mix driven, both the dynamics from Q1 to Q2 and then Q2 for the rest of the year. We do expect it to step down in Q3 and then up again modestly in Q4 driven by more software mix in the business.\nRob Mason: Very good. Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Devin Au with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDevin Au: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about your construction software business as well, really strong results there. I think one of our competitors reported yesterday and saw churn maybe up-tick slightly. But I'm just curious, if you've seen any similar dynamics around churn in the quarter, any noticeable up-tick or downtick? And if you can also comment on how retention or NRR has trended from last quarter that would be helpful?\nDavid Barnes: Yeah. The -- in our construction software businesses across the board, we're seeing very strong demand. So as Rob mentioned earlier, the pipeline is strong. We've seen no up-tick in churn and net retention trends are really good. So the fundamental subscription metrics look very solid across our construction software business.\nDevin Au: Got it. No, that's great to hear. And then, a quick follow-up for me, as you mentioned the closing of a large federal government order in geospatial, any details on how large that deal is? I just want to get more color on how much revenue got pulled forward from 3Q into 2Q? Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: It was just a touch over $18 million geospatial equipment for the federal government.\nDevin Au: Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: You're welcome.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary today will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons which will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. Let's begin on slide 2 with our key messages. Annualized recurring revenue is our key top line metric at Trimble. Our team, led by our construction software group, achieved 14% organic growth in the quarter, beating our internal expectations by 100 basis points. We now stand at a record $1.88 billion of ARR, which compares to $1.2 billion when we began our Connect and Scale journey in 2020. ARR has doubled since 2018 and tripled since 2015. We are on track to achieve $2 billion of ARR by the end of the year, a remarkable figure made possible by the Trimble team who continues to work incredibly hard to execute on our customer-driven systems, process and business model transformation. We delivered EBITDA margin of 25.3%, also slightly ahead of our expectations, which was driven by strong gross margin of 64.2%. For perspective, gross margin was 56.8% in 2015 and 58% in 2018. EPS at $0.64 and year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate to net income of nearly 100% demonstrates the power and potential of our asset-light business model. Our revenue beat in the quarter is attributable to delivering a large federal government order in the geospatial business in the second quarter instead of the third quarter. For the year, we are holding our revenue guidance and raising EPS. Moving to slide 3. Let's look at the progression of our Connect and Scale strategy through the lens of our reporting segments, beginning with Buildings & Infrastructure. The market backdrop remains generally favorable. In North America, we see strength in infrastructure and non-residential construction. Customer backlogs remain healthy and technology helps to address the skilled worker shortage. By the numbers, ACV bookings accelerated on a sequential basis, and we achieved a record level of bookings in the quarter. ARR grew over 20%. Our Trimble Construction One offering is achieving higher win rates, larger deal sizes and shorter sales cycles. Further, it is helping to grow both new logo and cross-sell bookings. We are confident in our ability to maintain momentum as our most recent release of digital systems upgrades provides significantly enhanced visibility to even further drive cross-sell and upsell. Strategically, we are pivoting more of our hardware offerings to adopt aspects of the subscription business model. For example, in building construction layout, our RI layout instrument is only available as a subscription. In civil construction, we have shifted more value to the software on the systems offering, thereby positioning us to reduce the upfront cost of a system and monetize over the life of the customer. In geospatial, the market backdrop is largely the same as buildings and infrastructure, yet serving a more highly penetrated customer base. By the numbers, revenue was well ahead of our internal expectations in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand from US state departments of transportation. And in the quarter, our team delivered the aforementioned federal government order. Strategically speaking, we saw ARR growth in our Trimble Catalyst product line. Catalyst offers precision positioning-as-a-service through a subscription offering. We passed the milestone this quarter with over 10,000 cumulative units shipped. We also expanded our product line in the reality capture space with the launch of our X9 scanner. We see reality capture as an important product category as it creates a key linkage between the physical and digital worlds, which we can uniquely serve. In Resources and Utilities, farmer sentiment has been trending negative despite market fundamentals such as commodity prices, largely continuing to be healthy. Our strategic focus in agriculture continues to be building out our aftermarket channel to gain dealer and customer intimacy, thereby providing farmers choice in their technology platforms. While revenue was down as expected, ARR grew at a double-digit rate. Our Positioning Services business continues to win customers in both on-road and off-road capacities, demonstrating our ability to innovate in the space of positioning technologies after 45 years in the business. We also took strategic steps to further ongoing ARR growth. In Forestry, we launched a cloud-based log inventory and management system that enables us to move down market, thereby expanding the addressable market. And in Utilities, the team delivered two of the largest software bookings in the history of the business. In Transportation, the market backdrop remains challenging with the soft freight market pressuring carriers to streamline their operations for cost savings to increase asset utilization and to increase the productivity of their nondriver workforce. Against this backdrop, the overall business both increased operating income margin for six consecutive quarters and grew organic ARR for the seventh consecutive quarter. In Europe, in our Transporeon business, we see early indications that the spot market might have bottomed out. Despite a difficult economic backdrop in Europe, churn is effectively zero, competitive win rates increased and the business is demonstrating an ability to manage the cost structure in line with the revenue environment. We have early examples of success with bringing the organizations together and making some product road map decisions to streamline product development work. Moving to Slide 4. Connect and Scale is a platform strategy, which in turn is fundamentally a vertical industry data strategy. No surprise then that we have been deploying artificial intelligence across Trimble for some time now, both for internal benefits and customer-facing applications. For example, a trial program with over 200 engineers using AI-assisted programming demonstrated upwards of 25% improvement in productivity. We have also extended AI into our sales process, where we are applying AI to the cost scripts of our sales reps to coach them and then further, again, to identify cross-sell opportunities. On the customer-facing front, we are improving our best-in-class positioning accuracy in harsh environments using AI-based error modeling and machine learning on many years of atmospheric data. We are deploying AI and video intelligence solutions in transportation to detect driver fatigue and distraction and for selective spraying applications in agriculture. In our construction software business, we are automating invoices by converting PDF data into usable accounts payable data. We've already processed over 350,000 invoices worth over $1 billion, compelling use cases and we are just beginning. Let me now turn the call over to David, to take us through the numbers. The Trimble operating system links strategy, people and execution with a belief set that we must strive for excellence across all three dimensions. The progress of the quarter represents the quality of the strategy and our ability to execute. I'll close with comments on people. In the quarter, we won a number of culture awards, reinforcing our ability to attract the best talent in the industry. We believe that part of attracting the best lies in developing the best talent of the future. Through our Trimble Labs initiative, we now sponsor 30 technology labs in 14 countries. We also believe in the health of our communities. In the quarter, we announced breaking ground on a 1.7 megawatt solar array as a renewable energy source at our headquarters, and our own technology is currently being utilized to increase the productivity and quality of this installation. Finally, let me take a moment to acknowledge that Steve Berglund retired from our Board of Directors, completing over 24 years of service at Trimble. We thank Steve for all of his contributions, dedication and years of service to the company. Borje Ekholm will Chair our Board of Directors through our next phase of growth. Operator, let's open the line to questions. Hey Kristen. Good morning, it's Rob. The transition is playing out mostly as expected. So, we feel good about where we are in this. It's obviously a process as we go around the globe, but we take an 80-20 principle as we work with our partners around the world from those that we're signing up. Thus far, I think there's very positive sentiment. This creates a closer connection to Trimble. It gets a broader portfolio of technology to take to market. So we're feeling good about it where we are, and there's still clearly a lot of work to be done. So I'd say, largely as expected so far. Yes, this has been an extraordinarily successful business for us really for the last couple of -- I can argue in the last couple of decades. To get that 2-centimeter and less accuracy on a farm or for a survey or for construction equipment, by the way, for ADAS systems and on-road vehicles, you need to have corrections, because you have errors in the atmosphere, you need additional geometry -- ground-based geometry to augment the satellites. So we've been a market leader, a technology leader in this capability for a long time now, continue to actually find ability to innovate in this space. From a market share perspective, I'd say it's pretty clear, we're the market leader as our technology goes on in ag, it goes civil construction equipment and machine control, it shows up in surveying all places where we have the market share lead. So the correlation on to Trimble equipment correlates to the market share we have, I'd say, and beyond because you don't just have to be Trimble on Trimble and we are mixed fleet. On the on-road space, that became a new frontier, let's say, a new addressable market that opened up for us in the last few years as automotive companies start towards their path -- towards autonomy. It's a series of progressive automation. That's why you see ADAS picking up as one of the first applications. So to no absolute position for lane detection, you're going to need to have corrections like we have. So, that's an emerging market with -- that presents an expanded addressable market for us. In terms of actually sizing specifically the addressable market, I have to admit it's a bit hard to do that, but I would put it as a certainly approaching $1 billion type market opportunity when you put the on-road business in as well. Hi, Jerry. Sure, Jerry. So the pipeline within construction is quite strong. This team is firing on all cylinders at the moment. It showed up in the organic ARR growth greater than 20%, which is clearly better than the company number at the plus 14% level organically. Bookings were grew faster than the ARR growth. Bookings grew sequentially. You'd asked me about that last quarter. So now you work backwards from the bookings and into the pipeline and the coverage ratios, and we like what we see. We see strong pipeline, strong coverage ratios, the Trimble construction one offering continues to get momentum for our sellers in the market. We see strong cross-sell activity within those bookings as the pieces come together quite nice and overlay the market backdrop on that, and infrastructure in North America is clearly a positive catalyst for us in all of the markets. So generally, a favorable macro meets a team executing extremely well and turns into a pipeline, which turns into that ARR. On the Transporeon side of the house, we're four months into the acquisition. So it's still relatively new. We like what we're seeing in the business so far. So as I think about the people, I think about the macros, I think about the business and I think about the integration opportunities that we have there. Now the macro is still more challenging in Europe. It's a mass micro monetization business model. So it's fundamentally transaction-based or consumption-based and then the nature of the mix of that consumption impacts the revenue. What we think we saw in the quarter is that it looks like spot prices might have hit a bottom and time will tell. If that's the case, then the business model is there and poised to increase accordingly. From a customer perspective, from wins in the market, we don't lose customers in this business. We did have new logo wins in the quarter, continue to have bookings growth in the quarter. So I like the start that we have in the business. Hey, Jonathan. Good morning. It's Rob. The TC1 so far has been, I'd say, a large success, and I think we're just getting started with it. I've had an example of a customer saying, okay, I used to have to have 14 different transactions with you to do business and now I can do it under one frame agreement. We're making ourselves easier to do business with. When we sign a frame agreement, let's say, with a customer who maybe is only buying one solution within TC1, if you sign the frame agreement, it's now easier to upsell. So that land and expand is more easily enabled because you don't have to go back and with a set of terms and conditions. Customers are able to connect workflows as we have tighter and tighter integrations in the data across the products and solutions that we sell to customers. So any surprise within TC1 to me as to the upside, it absolutely validates Connect and Scale and as the beacon for the rest of the company of what we can do when we rethink how we go to market and how we take our solutions to market. So I was very encouraged with what we're seeing in the business and proud of the team that's delivering it. Certainly, let's split the two and then the slide that goes along with the prepared remarks that we made on purpose, put one distinction of the internal facing example separate from the customer-facing examples.

You put that on top of selling more software, which comes naturally with a higher gross margin, and you get that 64.2% gross margin, which was a time of record we had from Q1 and is a remarkable change from gross margins of the past at Trimble. So it's more -- much more driven by that than price. Hi, Rob. Good morning. If we look at the segments within the market, clearly, infrastructure is the strong point, both, I'd say, North America, but also globally. There's also mega projects happening around the world and those are positives for us. On the, I'll say, the non-res side, if I exclude infrastructure non-res where we see pockets of -- continue to see pockets of strength and if I think here in North America, I think about renewable energy projects, we think about some onshoring of manufacturing, data centers, which correlates to AI, we believe, those are areas where we're seeing strength. And residential specifically, there's a little bit of a mixed tail. There's still a fair amount of new homebuilding happening, I'll stay within the US here for a bit on residential. But -- and so we see sort of up and down trends on that. I mean, it's been net down on residential, for sure. And hopefully, we can get to some stabilization on that. I don't know that I would call it stabilized yet in North America. But the economy looks like we might be able to head for us if we had for that soft landing, then that would be a good thing. Residential has been harder in Europe and then, that one have much more of a challenge than the US, and that's worth calling out. So you put the sum of that all together, and you get the forecast what -- we get the results that we have and the forecast that we put going forward."

            "content": "Turning now to slide 5 second quarter revenue of $994 million grew three percent organically. Revenue was above our expectations coming into the quarter, driven by the earlier-than-expected shipment of the large order of Geospatial equipment to the Federal Government that Rob mentioned earlier. Excluding that, revenues for the quarter were in-line with our projections. Our total company revenue growth versus prior year was driven by recurring software, both organic and from the addition of Transporeon. Gross margins were strong again in the second quarter, with non-GAAP gross margins of 64.2% tying the record levels of the first quarter. Our gross margins in the second quarter reflect favorable price/cost dynamics, strong growth of recurring software revenues and a higher margin mix within our product offerings. EBITDA margin of 25.3% in the second quarter was up 110 basis points year-over-year, benefiting from our strong gross margin performance. Operating and EBITDA margins continue to grow versus prior year, even as we lap strong year-ago revenues and as we continue to invest in our digital transformation. Cash flow in the second quarter improved on a year-over-year basis even taking into account Transporeon deal-related expenses. Our improved cash flow performance was the result of lower purchases of inventory, lower tax payments, and higher profitability. Our capital allocation priority remains debt repayment. And we made progress through the quarter on reducing our leverage. Turning now to, slide 6 for some additional color on our revenue performance. Product revenue, which includes both hardware and perpetual software, was down 5% organically in the second quarter and was aided by the federal order, which we had previously expected to ship in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline in product revenue this quarter reflects a difficult comparison with the second quarter of 2022, when our supply chain was freeing up and we were working through high hardware backlog. As expected, dealers reduced their inventories in the quarter. We expect some modest amount of additional dealer inventory reduction over the balance of this year. Our subscription and services revenue, which includes SaaS, term licenses, maintenance and support, recurring transactions and professional services, was up 13% on an organic basis, largely driven by strong bookings and net retention performance across our Buildings and Infrastructure software businesses. From a geographic perspective, revenues in North America, Asia Pacific and the Rest of World were up organically, by 3%, 11% and 18% respectively. Rest of World revenue growth was driven by strong demand for precision agriculture products from customers in Brazil. Revenues in Europe declined organically by 4%, as adverse macroeconomic factors impacted many of our businesses. Turning now to results by segment on slide 7, our software portfolio in the Buildings and Infrastructure reporting segment, continued to perform well, with organic ARR growth of over 20%. Bookings of recurring software offerings in the segment grew at a mid-20s percentage rate, despite the challenges of transitioning the North American software businesses onto our new digital infrastructure during the quarter. These large system implementations are never easy, but our teams powered through the transition, while still keeping our growth momentum going. With this latest release of our digital transformation, we now have over one-third of our Buildings and Infrastructure ARR, transacting through a connected system, which will facilitate the acceleration of our Connect and Scale strategy. Segment revenues of products for civil construction customers were down at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, reflecting strong shipment momentum a year ago. In the Geospatial reporting segment, we experienced organic revenue growth driven by the $18 million shipment to the federal government mentioned earlier. Excluding this one shipment, segment revenues in the quarter were down at a mid-single-digit organic rate, an improvement from the performance in the first quarter. This segment is most impacted by the downturn in residential home construction in North America and Europe. We expect to return to organic growth on an ongoing basis in the fourth quarter. In the Resources and Utilities segment, revenues were down year-on-year and fell modestly short of our expectations, driven by our agriculture business. While our sales to ag OEM customers grew versus prior year in the second quarter, revenue from our aftermarket channel was down. Three drivers help contextualize the aftermarket revenue decline. One, we are lapping a tough comp versus 2022 when our revenues surged as our supply chain freed up well ahead of the OEM supply chain. Second, the changes we announced a quarter ago and our aftermarket distribution network have, as expected, impacted our short-term revenue trends as we and our dealers refine our plans going forward. And third, we are seeing the impact from a softening of farmer sentiment, especially in Europe. We continue to see strong demand trends from ag customers in Brazil, and our positioning services business grew globally at a double-digit rate as we accelerated our cross-sell efforts. In the Transportation segment, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, driven by our North American Enterprise and Maps businesses. Our Mobility businesses in Europe and Brazil also grew revenue and ARR at a double-digit rate. As Rob mentioned earlier, operating margins improved sequentially once again. Our Trimble transportation team has made good progress in turning this business around. And while there's more work ahead of us, we are pleased with the progress. I'll note here that segment results now include the Transporeon business. Transporeon performance was largely in line with our expectations for the quarter, notwithstanding a tough macro environment in the European transportation industry. Moving now to Slide 8. We ended the second quarter with ARR of $1.88 billion, up 14% organically. Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, our backlog, stood at $1.6 billion at the end of the quarter. RPO related to recurring offerings grew by over $100 million year-over-year as a result of our strong bookings performance. Product RPO came down as expected year-over-year, reflecting our improved lead times. With this high level of RPO, we have significant visibility into our revenue in the coming quarters. On a 12-month rolling basis, our software services and recurring revenue of $2.3 billion represents a record 64% of our revenues, up 800 basis points from year ago levels. We completed the acquisition of Transporeon in the second quarter and reduced net debt by $150 million from the closing of the acquisition through quarter end. We plan to continue to delever, and as anticipated, expect to finish the year with net debt less than 3x EBITDA. Turning now to our guidance on Slide 9. The midpoint of our guidance for full year revenue remains the same as we issued last quarter. Our revenue guidance range has narrowed to $3.845 billion to $3.925 billion, which represents organic revenue growth in the second half of the year in the mid- to high single digits. We continue to expect ARR to grow at a mid-teens rate for the year. Our expectation for gross and operating margins has increased from prior guidance by 50 basis points, reflecting the strong performance in the second quarter and highly focus on margins and cost control. The end result is an increase in the midpoint of our earnings per share guidance range by $0.03. We now expect full year EPS in the range of $2.57 to $2.73. From a segment perspective, our expectation for full year growth in the Buildings and Infrastructure segment has improved following strong performance in the second quarter. Our forecast in Resources and Utilities is down modestly from the outlook of a quarter ago, reflecting weakening macroeconomic conditions in the agriculture sector. The outlook for Transportation and Geospatial is unchanged from last quarter. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect organic revenue growth in the range of 0% to 5%, which corresponds with a revenue range of $945 million to $985 million. We expect gross margins of 100 to 150 basis points lower than the second quarter, reflecting a less favorable business mix. We expect third quarter operating margins will be similar to second quarter levels. We project EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.64. From a segment perspective, we expect Geospatial revenues to be down organically at a mid-to-high single-digit rate as we won't have the positive impact of the large federal order this coming quarter. Resources and Utilities revenue is expected to be down at a mid-single digit organically. Revenue in Buildings and Infrastructure and Transportation are expected to continue to grow organically in the third quarter at rates comparable to or better than we experienced in the second quarter. Back to you, Rob. Sure. Hi Kristen. First thing I'll point out is that our business with the OEMs was up. So that's the good part of the story. The factors that I mentioned that caused our aftermarket business to be down year-on-year, a part of it is the macros. We see softening sentiment across many of the geographies is much more pronounced in Europe than the rest of the world, but we really see it in Europe. We've also changed our -- made announcement of changes to our distribution network. And so that's causing us and our dealers to sort of rethink our plans, and that clearly had a softening effect in the quarter. And then, we're just lapping really big numbers. Last year, we had really strong shipments as we were working through our supply chain. I'll point out our supply chain improved much more quickly than the OEMs. They get a lot more parts, more complex supply chain. So we saw the surge last year. It's a little tough to attribute, the causal nature of the aftermarket revenue decline to those three. It is a mix, and some of them are interrelated. But I think overall, the sort of long-term outlook remains positive, just as it was. We see these as -- all three of these factors is reasonably temporal. Yeah, sure. Jerry, one thing I'll say is that if you compare Trimble's trends with the OEMs, you have to keep in mind the year-on-year comps, including channel inventory, which are completely different for us. We work through our supply chain issues. In early last year, we saw the surge of shipment. Our channel inventories have been declining. That's not true for all the OEMs. The way I get comfort on the fourth quarter is from a couple of directions. First, from the bottom-up look at the businesses, the pipeline, the underlying trends. And then from a top-down perspective, I look at comparisons of our projections with the period before COVID in the supply chain. If you actually look at our organic growth going back to four years ago, so which is pre these disruptions. Actually, the fourth quarter compound organic growth is very comparable to Q3 and is actually consistent with what we've seen for several quarters. So it looks like a ramp-up, but when you take the noise of the supply chain-driven ups and downs from a year or two ago, it looks very achievable. So we're very confident in this fourth quarter outlook. Hey, Chad. First thing I'd say is that we're nearly all the way through the destocking. It won't be a meaningful factor for the back half of the year. There was some destocking in Q2. It was much smaller than Q1, so I don't really call that out as a major driver. But there's a -- it's not just the destocking this year. It was the increase in inventory levels last year that you're comparing against. So you've got to put those two together to compare our business trends with retail demand. And that's true across the markets we serve. From the segment perspective, the business where we think there has been some end user sales to retail or sales end user decline is in geospatial. That is the segment that is most impacted by residential construction, both in the United States and Europe. So that's been the softest. If you take the channel dynamics out both this year and last and the other businesses in ag and in civil construction, it looks like there's modest sales to retail growth even with the numbers we're posting. So that's kind of how we see it. Yes. So we got through the next phase of our digital transformation during Q2. We put our North American construction enterprise software businesses together on a common digital platform. And as I said in my prepared remarks, these big process and system changes are never easy, they can be disruptive. One of the things I'm most proud of with our team and our results is that we achieved nearly mid-20s-plus -- actually, and the businesses directly impacted by the digital transformation, almost 30% bookings growth, while the tools they use to track and sell have transformed. So that is a huge milestone. It's -- we are now in a position, only just now, to take advantage of the benefits that the common platform provides to us and further enhancements to that are going to roll out even this quarter. So we're getting to the point where cross-sell and the Connect and Scale vision is enabled and not hindered by diversity of systems. Now we have common technology. We have visibility into our pipeline. Salespeople can see what customer business is across the Trimble portfolio in ways that they couldn't systematically before. So we're just getting going. We're just beginning to realize the potential of this new process and tool for that business, and we will continue over the next year or two to roll out the same approach to the rest of our business. Yeah, Rob, it will -- it's mostly mix driven, both the dynamics from Q1 to Q2 and then Q2 for the rest of the year. We do expect it to step down in Q3 and then up again modestly in Q4 driven by more software mix in the business. Sure. Yeah. The -- in our construction software businesses across the board, we're seeing very strong demand. So as Rob mentioned earlier, the pipeline is strong. We've seen no up-tick in churn and net retention trends are really good. So the fundamental subscription metrics look very solid across our construction software business. It was just a touch over $18 million geospatial equipment for the federal government. You're welcome."

[Operator Instructions] And finally, I would like to advise all participants, this call is being recorded. Thank you. I\u2019d now like to welcome Rob Painter, Chief Executive Officer to begin the conference. Rob, over to you.\nRob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website; and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Let's begin on Slide 2 with our key messages. Annualized recurring revenue is our key top line metric at Trimble. Our team led by our construction software group achieved 13% organic growth in the quarter, 100 basis points ahead of our expectations.  We now stand at 1.65 billion of ARR, which compares to 1.2 billion when we began our Connect and Scale journey in 2020 and under 700 million at the beginning of 2017. Kudos to the Trimble team who have worked so hard to execute on our transformation. EBITDA is our other key P&L metric, and we delivered EBITDA of 27.2%, also slightly ahead of our expectations, which was driven by record gross margins of 64.2%. For perspective, gross margins in 2019 were 57.7% and 56.3% in 2016. Free cash flow conversion of 1.14x was also ahead of our expectations. I recognize that consensus numbers and the trading algorithm both still focus on total revenue and EPS. While these figures are important, they are secondary in relevance to ARR and cash flow, which are much more closely tied to fundamental value creation. Revenue and margins were both above expectations we set with the investor community back in February. We believe the delta to consensus figures was simply a function of the challenge in getting our quarters mapped correctly against our annual guidance. As a result, we will be more prescriptive with our second quarter commentary. With respect to the macro, like most companies, we are navigating an economic environment with a heightened sense of uncertainty trying to find the signal through the noise. Despite the noise, what we sell to customers is productivity, quality, safety, transparency, and environmental sustainability. The mid-to-long term secular tailwinds remain strong in the industries we serve. They are large global industries that are underserved and underpenetrated and they will continue to digitally transform. Our strategy compels us to be mindful of our cost structure in the short-term, while continuing to invest in our most attractive long-term opportunities. With respect to capital allocation, there are three main points. First, we divested three small businesses in the first quarter, bringing the total to 16 since 2020. Second, our recent B2W and Ryvit deals are both off to a strong start and performing ahead of expectations. Third, the investment we are making in our business transformation has initially been focused towards our software businesses. 1.65 billion of ARR growing double-digit in this climate as a proof point of high quality capital allocation. We are transforming our go to market motions to deliver bundled and connected solutions, while building the systems and processes to efficiently and effectively scale our business. At the company level, we think about our Rule of 40 as the sum of ARR growth and EBITDA margin, which represents our aspirational bar. Many of our software businesses have already cleared this hurdle, while others are steering this direction. Looking at our hardware businesses, this is where we have felt the whipsaw of supply chain availability and channel inventory stabilization, which continues to make quarterly comparisons of our numbers incomplete at best. To find the signal, you have to look at a multi-year view. Our largest hardware businesses and agriculture civil construction and geospatial, collectively grew revenues at a mid-single-digit rate from the first quarter of 2019 through the quarter of 2023. In the first quarter, channel inventories continued to draw down, thus retail demand significantly exceeded wholesale demand. Moving to Slide 3, let's look at the progression of our Connect and Scale strategy through the lens of our reporting segments beginning with buildings and infrastructure. Market backdrop generally remains healthy. In North America, we see strength in infrastructure and non-residential construction such as data centers, renewable energy, and manufacturing, slightly offset by pressure on residential. Customer backlogs remain healthy and technology helps to address the skilled worker shortage. By the numbers, ACB bookings grew double-digits in the quarter and ahead of plan, while ARR grew in excess of the company growth rate. Our Trimble Construction One commercial offering is helping to grow new logo and cross-sell bookings and our next wave of systems automation will be released in the next few weeks. Through the lens of strategic progression, customer wins at England's National Highways and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration demonstrate customers want integrated Trimble offerings. At CONEXPO, our technology was present on 20 OEM booths, demonstrating the continued relevance of the mix fleet. In our introduction of an all-in-one system for on machine excavator guidance insight serving, demonstrates that we can continue to expand the size of the addressable market by virtue of reaching new machine categories. In geospatial, the market backdrop is generally the same as buildings and infrastructure with a higher mix of residential exposure, which presents a headwind. Managing channel inventory levels is a priority in this segment. By the numbers, revenue was ahead of our internal expectations in the quarter. Strategically speaking, we continue to see strong demand from U.S. State Department of Transportation and we see product lines such as mobile mapping showing solid growth. In resources and utilities, while farmer sentiment has been dropping, the market fundamentals continue to be healthy. Commodity prices remain high by historical standards and input costs are moderating. Strategically speaking, we are on the path towards building out our aftermarket distribution and agriculture. We believe in giving farmers a choice in their technology platforms and we believe in the power of independent technology dealers where we have the direct relationship. While there's a lot of work ahead of us, feedback from current and prospective partners is positive, We know how to build and manage a channel that reference our SITECH model in civil construction and a similar initiative in our geospatial channel as case studies and excellence of channel development. In the quarter, we also announced advanced path planning technology, which takes us a step further on the path toward fully autonomous equipment for a variety of industries. In our positioning services business, we announced that Nissan has gone live with the most advanced driver assist system to date, which is enabled by Trimble positioning technology. This is another example of Connect and Scale, taking a core Trimble technology and applying it across new and existing verticals. By the numbers, we were largely unplanned this quarter. In transportation, the market backdrop is very dynamic with a softening freight market pressuring carriers to find new frontiers of efficiency which technology can help address. By the numbers, we met our expectations in the quarter and we have delivered five sequential quarterly increases and operating income as a percent of revenue. Strategically speaking, we are making progress with our new In-Cab technology platform, which delivers the open platform that our customers have been asking for. We launched new functionality in the quarter, including the first industry dwell time metrics for fleet management, which provides customers with additional metrics they can use to improve their operational efficiency. The biggest news for us in transportation was closing of the Transporeon deal on April 3. I've described this business as a perfect example of a platform play within our strategy. The why, comes in the form of a network of over 158,000 carriers and over 1,400 shippers transacting approximately \u20ac55 billion of freight on an annual basis. Every day, over 110,000 transports and over 100,000 docs scheduling appointments are managed on the Transporeon platform. Slide 4 provides a summary overview of how we see the complementary aspects coming together to create a stronger franchise. In the form of complementary capabilities, customers, and geographic reach. The business model of Transporeon is fundamentally a consumption based model based on an array of transaction fees. Since we announced the deal in December, demand in Europe has slowed. And the mix has shifted towards a greater percentage of contract over spot transactions, which are monetized at a lower rate. Our guidance reflects what we believe is a de-risked 2023 level of dollar denominated revenue, approximately 10% below what we communicated in December. While this is disappointing there are also positive signals. Bookings are still expected to grow well over 30% for the year. Market share is holding, customer churn is almost non-existent and our tax rate assumption improved and cross-selling opportunities with Trimble are looking stronger than they did just a few months ago. Let me now turn the call over to David to take us through the numbers.\nDavid Barnes: Thank you, Rob. I'll start on Slide 5. First quarter revenue of 915 million was above our expectations coming into the quarter. I'll remind you that revenues were exceptionally strong early last year as we recovered from our supply chain challenges and worked to bring down backlog. So, our comps this quarter were difficult. Our organic revenue decline in the first quarter is entirely attributable to reductions in dealer inventories. Gross margins were exceptionally strong in the quarter. As Rob mentioned, our 64.2% gross margins are a record in the history of Trimble reflecting both an accelerated mix toward higher margin software offerings and the positive net impact of price realization and lower input costs for our hardware products. Gross margins in the first quarter benefited from a high level of term license renewals in several of our software businesses so we expect some moderation from this high level in the coming quarters. While we continued to spend in the quarter against our strategic initiatives, our strong performance on the gross margin line led to higher EBITDA and operating margins, up 170 basis points and 120 basis points respectively versus prior year. We are pleased with our ability to drive high margins even in a tough environment and as we invest in our business.  Cash flow in the quarter improved significantly year-on-year with both cash flow from operations and free cash flow in excess of non-GAAP net income. Our improved cash generation reflects a reduction in cash outflow for hardware component purchases and lower incentive compensation. Note that we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and will continue the suspension of share repurchases until we have paid down a meaningful portion of the debt raised fund the Transporeon acquisition. Turning now to Slide 6 for some perspective on the underlying drivers of our revenue trends. I'd like to call your attention to a change we have made in the presentation of our revenue breakout on our financial statements. Going forward, our revenue will be broken out in two components. The first category is products, while the second category is subscriptions and services. Product revenue consists of hardware offerings, and our non-recurring perpetual software, while subscription and services revenue is predominantly recurring. In presenting our revenue in this way, we are being responsive to investors who increasingly think of our growth separately in recurring and non-recurring revenues. We think this new presentation is better aligned with our strategy going forward. Product revenue, including hardware and perpetual software was down 15% organically in the first quarter. The decline in product revenue this quarter reflects a tough comparison with the first quarter of 2022, when our supply chain was freeing up and we were working through extraordinarily high backlog. Our dealers reduced their inventories as expected in the first quarter of this year and we estimate that dealer inventory reductions accounted for roughly 40 million or nearly half of our product revenue decline. Subscription and services revenue was up 14% on an organic basis. To put our first quarter revenue performance into a longitudinal perspective, it is instructive to look at the compound growth back to 2019 before the impacts of COVID and supply chain swings. In this view, total revenue compounded at a 5% rate in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2019. From a geographic perspective, revenue was down 9% organically in Europe. Nearly half of the Europe revenue decline can be attributed to our decision to exit our Russia business. In North America and Asia Pacific, our revenues in the quarter were essentially flat, while revenue in the rest of world grew 6% driven by strong demand from agriculture customers in Latin America. Turning now to Slide 7, we ended the first quarter with ARR at 1.65 billion, up 13% organically. Backlog of 1.6 billion was up slightly versus the prior quarter and down from 1.7 billion a year ago. Hardware and perpetual software related backlog was down 200 million year-over-year, driven by our dramatically improved lead times. Recurring related backlog was up over 100 million year-over-year and up 40 million sequentially due to our growing bookings of recurring solutions. On a 12-month rolling basis, our software services and recurring revenue of 2.2 billion represents 62% of our revenue, up 700 basis points from year ago levels. As we near the completion of the Transporeon acquisition, we did so from a strong balance sheet position with net debt at approximately 1.1x EBITDA. Turning now to results by segment on Slide 8, our software portfolio and buildings and infrastructure had a strong quarter with ARR, up organically by approximately 20%. Segment revenue to our civil construction customers, which are predominantly made up of hardware, were down year-on-year in the quarter as expected as our dealers worked down their inventories. Excluding the impact of dealer inventory changes, we estimate that our retail sales of civil construction offerings were up in the quarter at a high-single-digit rate, reflecting a favorable environment for infrastructure investment. In total, buildings and infrastructure saw 5% organic revenue growth with operating margins over 28%. Transportation segment revenues grew year-on-year organically in the quarter, while operating margins exceeded 15%. Importantly ARR grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter for this segment. The turnaround of our transportation business is underway and we are encouraged by the continuous improvement in ARR growth, revenue growth, and operating margins. In the Resources and Utilities segment, revenue was down organically as expected. Like our other hardware centric businesses, R&U revenue trends were impacted significantly by tough comps with prior. In the first quarter of 2022, R&U revenues grew 16% organically as our supply chain freed up and we worked to bring down backlog. On a [full-year basis] [ph], first quarter revenues were up at a compound annual growth rate of just over 6%. Segment margins were extremely strong in the quarter, reflecting lower input cost and the benefit of higher price realization. In the geospatial segment, which is also heavily dependent on hardware, we saw revenue down 16% on an organic basis in the quarter, but modestly better than our forecast. More than half of the year-on-year organic revenue decline for the segment relates to dealer inventory dynamics as dealers reduce their overall inventory levels this year. Geospatial revenues grew organically by over 16% in the first quarter of last year as we brought down backlog. Our geospatial business has felt the slowdown in residential home construction, which has impacted many of our survey customers. I'll now turn to guidance on Slide 9, where we have a number of moving pieces. We are updating our annual guidance to bridge the addition of Transporeon for the remainder of the year. We are also being more prescriptive with our view in the second quarter with the addition of Transporeon. Let's start with the annual outlook pre-Transporeon where we are confirming our baseline guidance view for the business, including our outlook for mid-teens organic ARR growth and full-year organic revenue growth of 2% to 5%. Incorporating Transporeon, we expect the addition of approximately 135 million in revenues over the balance of the year and approximately 175 million of ARR by the end of the year. As such, we now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of 3.835 billion to 3.935 billion. We project that our ARR, including Transporeon will be approximately 2 billion at the end of 2023. We continue to expect the gross margins will expand in the range of 300 basis points for the year versus 2022, coming down sequentially in the second quarter and then progressing up again in the second half of the year. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Our guidance now assumes a more favorable tax rate than our last forecast based on a more favorable outlook on our tax rate from the Transporeon acquisition. Our updated outlook for earnings per share is in the range of $2.52 to $2.72, reflecting a mid-single-digit percentage dilution from Transporeon and related interest expense, which is in-line with what we indicated in December. We continue to expect the Transporeon will be roughly neutral to 2024 EPS and accretive thereafter. We affirm our free cash flow projection for the year of approximately 1x non-GAAP net income, reflecting in part our plan to reduce inventory levels. Shortly after the close of the Transporeon acquisition, our pro forma net leverage stood at approximately 3.25x with approximately $3.1 billion in net debt. The debt we raised in connection with our Transporeon acquisition carries an interest rate of approximately 6.3%, in-line with our expectations at the time the deal was announced. Given our current cash flow projections, we expect to end 2023 with leverage under 3x. We said in our announcement of the Transporeon acquisition that we expected to restore leverage to below 2.5x within 18 months to 24 months following the acquisition. Our updated projections suggest that we will be able to de-lever to our 2.5x goal sooner than that original time line. Turning to the second quarter. The midpoint of our guidance reflects a return to organic revenue growth with revenue between $962 million and $992 million and EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.61. We expect the impact of additional dealer inventory reductions in the second quarter will be about half the rate of the first quarter with stocking levels at or near normal levels by the end of June. We expect that our gross margin percentage will be lower sequentially in the second quarter, due to lower term license revenue and a higher share of hardware. Operating margins will also be down sequentially to approximately 22%, reflecting both lower gross margins and higher operating expense from annual salary increases. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect higher rates of ARR and revenue growth. We expect revenue to increase sequentially from the second quarter through the fourth quarter. We project that the fourth quarter will be our best of the year across the key metrics of financial performance, including total revenue, ARR growth, organic revenue growth, and operating margins. As it relates to our view on segment growth throughout the rest of the year, we expect all four of our segments to post improving, sequential, organic ARR, and revenue growth through the balance of 2023. Buildings and Infrastructure will remain our fastest-growing segment as we expect our recurring software businesses to sustain solid performance while our civil hardware business improves with more normalized dealer inventories. We expect our geospatial segment to return to positive organic growth in the second half of the year, but remain modestly down for the full-year. We expect resources and utilities to return to growth late in the second half of the year, driven by an expected pickup in our aftermarket channels. Over to you, Rob.\nRob Painter: When we think about our right to win at Trimble, we believe we can uniquely bring together users and connect workflow between the physical and digital worlds across industry continuums. Connect and Scale is our strategy. Our strategy is a platform strategy. The platform strategy is in turn a data strategy. If we are successful in our pursuits, we will collect one of the most complete data sets in and across industries, creating a flywheel of enhanced insights and data connectivity. AI has captured the world's attention, ours too. We believe our corpus of industry-specific data will unlock and accelerate our long-term value creation model. As I conclude my remarks, I want to take a moment to honor the memory of Sandra MacQuillan, who passed away last week after a year's long battle with cancer. Sandra was a dedicated member of our Board and was a valuable contributor to our company's success. Sandra's insight, courage, and support for our business will be greatly missed. She helped make Trimble a better company. She helped me to become a better leader. On behalf of the entire Trimble team, I extend our deepest condolences to Sandra's family and loved ones.  Operator, let's open the line to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone.\nRob Painter: Hi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering, Rob, David, maybe if you just talk about the cadence of ARR growth in Buildings and Infrastructure, it looks like that might have slowed a touch in the quarter. Can you just talk about the drivers and then your outlook for total company ARR growth is to accelerate from 13% this quarter to mid-teens the rest of the year? Can you just step through the drivers, please?\nDavid Barnes: Sure. Jerry, it's David. There no fundamental change in the momentum of the business \u2013 recurring business in Buildings and Infrastructure. It happens to be the case that in the first quarter, that's when the term licenses renew. And so, if you're going to have churn, that's when you have it. And that factor will abate and we expect to end the year actually a little north of 20% for Buildings and Infrastructure ARR. So, the momentum is solid.\nJerry Revich: And David, is your \u2013 just to put a finer point on that. So, you're looking for an acceleration in total ARR from 13% to 15% for the full-year, just to put a finer point on that since obviously, mid-teens is a pretty wide range?\nDavid Barnes: Yes, you're right, mid-teens. I'll try not to be too specific, but it's north of 13%. So yes, we project that ARR growth will accelerate for the balance of the year.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Super. And can I ask on Transporeon. The margin profile at these lower sales level, how does that compare versus your expectations? Previously, and then I just want to make sure I caught you right, that it was a 10% decline in the revenue expectations because just three quarters of the full-year revenue run rate, that does seem to be a touch higher than the revenue guidance for Transporeon that we're seeing here?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. So first, the 10% refers to will have \u2013 we project 10% less revenue than you could have extrapolated from the directional indication we gave in December. It's still growing. It's just growing a little more slowly than we'd expect. From a margin perspective, we indicated that EBITDA margins would be about 30%. I still think that's the long-term trend, but we've lost a little bit of fixed cost leverage. Probably the simplest way to think about that for the year, Jerry, is Transporeon margins will be pretty close to the Trimble average this year and then higher as the business gets back to growth or higher levels of growth.\nJerry Revich: Got it. Thank you, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRob Wertheimer: Hi, thanks. Good morning everybody. So ,the gross margin breakout was quite interesting, and I understand that the mix is favorable as hardware decline and software continues growing. I guess my question is, is there anything we should think about is that having taken a step function up and you reinvest it in R&D? Or is it really more of a shifting mix of business?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. There's two big factors that drove gross margin up significantly in the quarter. One is, as you said, the mix shift is very favorable because our hardware business was down and the software business was up, but an equally important factor is that we're way past the hump of our inflationary cycle in our hardware businesses. In fact, year-on-year, our input costs are down. We were heavily dependent on expedited freight in the broker market for parts a year ago, and we've got more price realization. So, we have seen a pretty important improvement in the margins within our hardware portfolio.\nRob Wertheimer: And then, should we think about that as being sustainable in a way and then being consciously reinvested in more R&D?\nDavid Barnes: Well, we're investing in our business. The guidance and the script comments reflect. We don't think the gross margins will stay at the high level they were in Q1 for the rest of the year. We'll be modestly below that, partly because the mix comes back to a more normalized mix as our hardware businesses get past the hump of dealer inventory reductions. But look, if you look at our operating expense, even for \u2013 with the year's outlook, we will grow OpEx faster than revenue.  We normally don't like to do that, but we're investing against our business. Part of it is R&D. Part of it is against the digital transformation, the creation of platforms. So, we are investing against the business even while we get through the noise of the supply chain and the higher gross margins helps us do that.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you very much. And then just one last one. On channel destock, has anything happened in the last 2 or 3 months to increase the headwind from destock? I'm thinking about the ag channel and moves OEMs are doing there? And maybe if you could broadly just tell us when we're through the [destock pulse] [ph]? So, I will stop there. Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: Sure. I'd say the pace of inventory, destock is exactly what we thought it would be a quarter ago, and we'll be essentially all the way through it by mid-year. We're on the plan on destocking that we laid out a quarter ago. And yes, I think that answers your question. And that's true for our businesses in aggregate, so including the ag business.\nRob Wertheimer: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nKristen Owen: Great. Thank you. Good morning. David, I wanted to follow up on your comment about the reinvestment, specifically about the digital transformation. Rob, you closed the prepared remarks talking about the data flywheel. So, can you just talk to us about where we are in that journey? How you intend to make better utilization of that data? And just yes, at what stage we are in, sort of that reinvestment journey for the back-end systems to support?\nDavid Barnes: I'll comment on pacing and Rob can add on the data strategy. So, we're about to cross an important milestone where we've put into production, the digital backbone for our North American enterprise software business for the construction industry, so that will go live next week. And what that does, Kristen, is systematically enables the TC1 bundles that we've been selling in a sort of [indiscernible] way to date.  And we've had success in the [indiscernible] approach, but we're about to cross an important milestone in what we call digitally-enabled Trimble construction one with bundles that are more accessible and easier for our people to sell and our customers to consume. This is part of the journey we're on. We have additional rollout scheduled for our digital transformation that over the next couple of years will benefit the whole of our business. So, we're going to see some tangible \u2013 much more tangible benefits from the investments we've been making on digital transformation.\nRob Painter: Kristen, I'll add a comment on the data strategy, part of your question. And I start with the corpus of data at Trimble and construction, we manage over $1 trillion of construction projects and ag, we manage over technology and over 180 million acres of farmland and transportation. We manage a couple of million vehicles on the road, and that's even pre-Transporeon, and our geospatial business fundamentally is about creating a digital model of the physical earth. So there's, I'd say, a profound corpus of data opportunities. Our digital transformation, a big part of that is unlocking that data, getting it into the cloud. Once you've got it in a cloud, I have the opportunity to take data into information. And then when we're thinking about artificial intelligence, we've been playing in this arena for a while, it's quite exciting. It's actually also quite fun. We're already developing predictive and generative AI-based solutions covering all of our end markets and covering a number of workflows within that. And I will still say, we are very, very early in the journey. So, if you take a market like agriculture, with the Bilberry acquisition that we did on selective spring, we're applying deep learning technology to be able to identify [weeds] [ph] and enable spraying at the plant level instead of at the field level in our Viewpoint business and construction, we're applying natural language processing to automate invoicing processing workflows. In the Geospatial business, we're working on already point cloud semantic segmentation so then you can automatically extract and classify assets from large data sets and in our transportation business. We have video intelligence solutions that can detect fatigue and driver distraction and therefore, improve the safety, and we're just at the beginning of this.\nKristen Owen: That's very helpful. And leads me to my follow-up question, which is really one about the competitive environment. I mean you talked about some of the trends that we've seen on the technology side. And certainly, over your tenure, you've seen a lot of shifts in that technology space. But I think the investor sentiment suggests that some of the recent announcements that you all have made and maybe some of those made by your partners, suggest that there's a shift happening in the competitive environment. So, can you just speak to that? Any discussion of disintermediation or how you view your competitive positioning today? That would be helpful. Thank you.\nRob Painter: From a competitive standpoint, the thing that is most singularly unique about Trimble, and I think forms the basis of our right to win in our markets is our ability to connect the physical and the digital world. So, it's connecting work in the office with work in the field. That means connecting the hardware and the software of Trimble. And I think in that respect, we're singularly unique. When I think about potential OEM disintermediation, I go to the customer, that customer is a farmer, it's a contractor, it's a trucking company. More often than not, they're looking for a neutral provider of technology to operate across a mixed fleet. And we don't see that fundamentally changing in the aftermarket, and we hear more customers saying, how is this going to work for me if I have OEM proprietary technology, multiple OEM proprietary technology? Because remember, they operate mixed fleets. How does that benefit a customer? That's what we hear feedback from out in the field, and it gives me conviction that we're on the right path. Now, does that mean that, that will \u2013 that OEMs would not, let's say, pursue a strategy, I'd say, of course, not. We just have to be able to innovate faster and show that value of the connection between the physical and the digital world. That's why for the last 15 years, 20 years, we've been creating a software ecosystem around that hardware that we have to create these integrated and connected workflows. Not to mention that's the technology side of it. And then you apply the go-to-market aspect of you actually take this to market, how you actually monetize what are the business models around it, where are the data insights that you can unlock from this. So, I'd say, yes, there is certainly a different competitive environment that exists today versus 5, 10, 15 years ago. And I think a lot of the let's say, competitive world woke up to the attractiveness of these markets that we're serving that are large, global, underserved and underpenetrated. So, we feel good about where we stand in that environment, Kristen.\nKristen Owen : Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. With the Transporeon acquisition, can you give us a little bit more color on the impact to the growth rate? And maybe what incrementally changed in the macro to cause that reduction in expectation? It's a little bit of a larger reduction than we would have thought just given the price paid for the company?\nRob Painter: So Jonathan, this is Rob. Good morning. From, I'd say, if I look at the financials of the business, whether that's the overall growth of the business, the gross margins, the ARR growth in the business, the bookings growth in the business, we see those as accretive to the to the business model of overall Trimble that doesn't change. And then our view is \u2013 continues to be look at the mid-term and beyond, and it will be even more significantly accretive given the nature of the platform and the density that the business has of carriers and shippers. To the second question on what changed in the macro view. And I'd say, yes, absolutely, it's disappointing from my perspective as well. When we break down the underlying factors, we looked and saw a couple of things, and maybe three things to mention. The first is the overall level of transactions has gone down in Europe. And when we look at the end markets, markets like CPG, retail, chemicals or three relatively big markets for the business. The transaction volume slowed more than we expected. CPG, I look at that one is one that people are still going to eat. So, I don't lose a conviction that this is a temporary phenomenon in the business. The second aspect, which really probably also relates to the third is the spot prices have come down and the business differentially monetizes when spot rates are higher. So, spot rates will come down if transaction volume comes down. The third piece, which connects actually though, back to spot prices, is that truck capacity went up in Europe and so if you follow new unit trucks hitting the market in Europe, that capacity increased at the same time as the transaction slowed further pressuring spot prices. So, those would be the three factors. But now let me not end on that note, let me end on the note that we expect to see 30% bookings growth in the business this year. When we look at prior economic cycles in the business, this business has accelerated out of each of those cycles. It's fundamentally a transaction-oriented business. There's no loss of customers. In fact, when rates are strong as ever, 40 new customers were onboarded onto the platform in the first quarter before we owned it. So, the underlying fundamentals of the quality, I would say, of the business are there. And we believe it would be poised to as a bounce back when the markets improve.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. And just in terms of a quick follow-up. Can you give us a sense of what your dollar-based net retention looks like for your ARR? We're just trying to understand sort of how much of that ARR is coming from new versus existing customers? Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: Jonathan, you're talking about for the company as a whole?\nJonathan Ho: Company as a whole?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. I'll focus on the outlook for the year. We expect net retention to be very strong, north of 100% in the ZIP code of 110%. What gets us there? Our churn varies by business and most of our recurring businesses the churn is very low in the low to mid-single digits. SketchUp is structurally higher than that, but we generate the positive net retention pushing at high-single-digits through low churn and upsell and cross-sell of new offerings. And as Rob mentioned, the uniqueness of the breadth of our offering, we're really having traction in the building software portfolio of cross-selling, Viewpoint and our ]Technostructures] [ph] and MEP offerings. And so, that's what gets net retention into the high single-digit range. 100-plus high single digits.\nRob Painter: And Jonathan, the thing I'd add to that is the nature of the technology at Trimble is that it's mission-critical. You're using it most of the day. It's not a nice to have on the shelf-type software that you can easily get rid of.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nChad Dillard: Hi, good morning guys.\nDavid Barnes: Hi, Chad.\nChad Dillard: So, I want to go back to an earlier question about ARR in the Building and Infrastructure business. I think you talked about, Rob going from, kind of 13% to about greater than 20%. I was just curious about what line of sight do you have to that? Maybe you can talk about any key products that are driving that? And to what extent are you seeing some of the cross-sell driving some of that growth?\nRob Painter: Sure, Chad. Hey, this is Rob. So the 13% was at the company level of organic ARR growth that we see going up through the rest of the year. If we go into Buildings and Infrastructure, specifically, the Buildings and Infrastructure grows, ARR has been growing faster than that company average. And we expect that to grow throughout the year as well in Buildings and Infrastructure. When we go through the business reviews, and one of the things that is, I'd say, great about an ARR business model is, we closed in the quarter at $1.65 billion of ARR. And by the way, that's a conservative view of ARR. We don't take the contracted ARR view at the end of the quarter, which would be higher. But we wake up on the first day of the second quarter, and we've got line of sight to $1.65 billion of revenue going forward for the next year. And you can see that show up in the remaining performance obligations. And so, when we look at the businesses, you can get a bit scientific about it because you can go and do a go get analysis. You understand the revenue you're walking in with whether it's a quarter or a year or multi-year period. You know get delta that you have to close in order to hit the ARR forecast. Against that delta, you look at a pipeline that you have a bookings pipeline and then it's a conversion ratio of that bookings pipeline to what can hit short-term ARR versus will become deferred revenue that's monetized over time. Now, within that, if I take Buildings and Infrastructure, specifically, cross-sell and upsell are significantly driving business for us, the bookings of business that we have. What we're seeing is that we're bringing on new logos as we go to market as One Trimble through this Trimble Construction One offering. We're seeing cross-sell between Viewpoint and Tekla. We're seeing it from our bid-to-win acquisition and the Viewpoint business. We're seeing it from Viewpoint and our MEP business. I'm just really proud of the team who's put in the work to define the business model offerings and to organize the go-to-market efforts and the sales enablement behind that to actually execute on a vision. It's easy to have a division. The work happens behind the scenes to bring it to life. And the team is \u2013 continues to deliver proof points that we're on the right track here. We're seeing higher win rates in the deals in the market. We're seeing larger deal sizes when we go to market as One Trimble, we're seeing shorter sales cycles when we do it. So, I like the setup. We expect to continue to see strong growth. Buildings and Infrastructure and the construction software within that, that's the tip of the spear for the transformation at Trimble. We're putting really I'd say the strong, strong majority of our efforts behind making that business successful and using that as a template for the rest of the organization. And I think the last thing I would say is, ultimately, we're taking dollars to the bank, not percentages. These numbers continue to get bigger and bigger. So, posting strong double-digit growth on a larger base, I think is worth noting, David, I think, mentioned in his comments that we could expect to see $2 billion of ARR by the end of the year and Buildings and Infrastructure would presumably be about half of that.\nChad Dillard: That's helpful. My second question is about just your two core channels, right? So, you've got the OEM channel aftermarket. First, can you just break down the mix between the two? And then secondly, more specific to OEM. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? What was the growth in 1Q? And then what are you expecting through the balance of the year?\nRob Painter: Sorry, Chad, do you mean at a company level? Or do you mean at a segment level?\nChad Dillard: I mean company level to begin with, but if you can give that segment detail, I'll be most curious about B&I and resource.\nRob Painter: Well, from a segment perspective, we \u2013 outside of Resources and Utilities actually very little goes through OEMs. It's in the single-digit percentage in the Resource and Utilities. Of course, that's agriculture. And I think we've said about 25%.\nDavid Barnes: It was a little higher than that in 2022 because actually, our business through OEMs was particularly strong. So, it was about a third of our R&U segment. And it's held up well, I'll say. So, our business with OEMs is strong right now.\nChad Dillard: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino of KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJason Celino: Hi gentlemen. Good morning. Your construction software business continues to be one of your better performing segments, a lot of questions today so far. But David, you mentioned seeing a little bit of additional churn in Q1 for some term licenses. It sounds like it's minor, but I don't know if you can clarify this a little bit.\nDavid Barnes: Yes. I don't think it's additional versus any longer-term trend. It's just that the term licenses, it's actually a bit of a factor of our old technology that we're improving with our new digital infrastructure, but the terms all coincide on January 1. So, if you're going to churn as a customer, you churn on January 1. So, it's \u2013 I call that a blip. That factor won't recur in any of the coming quarters. And we think we're on the sustained trend of solid ARR growth for Buildings and Infrastructure. As Rob said, it was about 20%, and we think it will end the year a little more than where we were in Q1.\nJason Celino: Okay. So, it sounds like this might be for some of your older solutions.\nDavid Barnes: I wouldn't say it's older solutions. It's solutions that are enabled by our older infrastructure technology as we roll-out our digital infrastructure, we could be more flexible in how our licensing models work, and we won't have the situation where our terms all in at the same time, which isn't convenient for us or even for some of our customers. So, that's how things will improve.\nJason Celino: Okay, perfect. And then on second quarter specifically, I think, any way to clarifying how much Transporeon is contributing? I realized that the full year is 135 million, but anything that we should know about seasonality or how that might ramp through the year? Thanks.\nDavid Barnes: Yes. So it's $135 million for the three quarters, a little less than a third of that. Around 30% will be in Q2 and corresponding you'll have a little more than a third in Q4.\nJason Celino: Perfect. Thank you.\nDavid Barnes: Welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open. \nTami Zakaria: Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So, my first question is on the transportation segment. So, we've heard some Chuck OEMs partnering with third parties to install a single device that runs on an open platform and is developing apps for ELV tools, telematics and stuff. So, what are the risks or opportunities for Trimble in this emerging new narrative?\nRob Painter: Hi, good morning, Tami. It's Rob. Well, we've been working in this space as you know for a long time, both predominantly in the aftermarket, but with one OEM in our transportation business, in the short-term, we don't see a change to the business that we have with our OEM partner. Long-term or actually even mid-to-long term, the exact nature of the upgrades we're making on our technology in the transportation business is to deliver the open platform that customers in the aftermarket have been looking for. Back to an earlier conversation we're having in the Q&A on mix fleets. The same dynamic happens with trucking companies most are operating multiple \u2013 yes, multiple truck OEMs within their fleet even different engine types. So, you can have really quite different configurations, different configuration perform better at different parts of the country. What you would need here in Colorado and the mountains is a different machine or I'd say a different truck performed \u2013 is optimized better here than it is in a different part of the country. And so, we continue to see customers looking to integrate mixed fleets. When you have that open platform that can come out of the OEMs, when they have that openness, you can put in a Trimble or a Trimble competitor technology and user interface on top of that. So, I think it's an equalizer in the market.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. That's very helpful. Another quick one from me. Is there any seasonality we should expect from the 135 million incremental revenue from Transporeon or should we just ratably allocate over the next three quarters?\nDavid Barnes: Yes. Tami, it's David. There is some seasonality in the business. Historically, it's strongest in the fourth quarter. There's a lot of goods that flow closer to the holiday season. But I don't \u2013 there's also some underlying growth. So, the way I would suggest you look at it the way we look at it is of the 135 million, we'll have roughly 30% in Q2, a third in Q3 and a little more than a third of Q4.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Josh Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJosh Tilton: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just want to step back for a second. Can you maybe just help us understand why in-light of the [current macro] [ph], you're only reducing Transporeon revenue expectations, but you're reiterating the guidance for the rest of the business? Can you maybe just talk to the visibility that you have for the rest of the year? And what gives you confidence in hitting the back half numbers?\nDavid Barnes: Hey, Josh, David Barnes. I'll start. So the Transporeon business model, as Rob mentioned, is transaction-based, principally not a subscription. So, our software offerings, as Rob discussed earlier, are mission-critical for our customers and are much less susceptible to any short-term trend in the end customers ongoing transaction or ongoing level of business. Our view is that there's some puts and takes, but the aggregate demand we see for our business has not changed over the last 90 days. We do see some signs that in a few of our end markets, actually, the overall macro outlook is improving. I look at Geospatial, for instance, we assess our dealers for their sentiment. We talked to some of their customers in the survey business. They're feeling a little better than they were. Input costs are abating. So, overall, we're very confident with the outlook for the rest of the business that we articulated a quarter ago. Transporeon is impacted by the particular macros of Europe and the end markets they serve.\nRob Painter: I can add a little color to that. I encourage you to separate the software businesses from the hardware businesses and that analysis. If you look at the software business. I submit there's 1.65 billion reasons to have conviction in our view of the rest of the year, and that's because that's the ARR. And again, that's not even a contracted ARR, which would be higher than that, 1.6 billion of backlog or those remaining performance obligations as well gives us visibility. We know the bookings we have. It's really a bit of a science to translate to bookings into the recognized revenue. So, our conviction and our predictability on that stream of our revenue is going to be the highest. And then I think you take separately the hardware businesses, which David walked you through. We've been through dynamics of the dealer inventory stabilization. Now, let's look at the macros around it. And I think that's a fair question to test our conviction on this. [Take agriculture,] [ph] we see farm income being healthy this year. We take North America construction, and we see the infrastructure bill being providing a tailwind the business. So, those are the kind of factors that go into our view for the rest of the year. And certainly then would become the things that we have to watch and then we'll update you on again next quarter.\nJosh Tilton: Super helpful. And then maybe one more for me. I know you guys got a lot of questions on Building and Infrastructure. I'm going to ask one more, although it's maybe a little unusual. A lot of your construction peers believe that it's kind of hard to know exactly which markets are stronger and which are weaker, given their customers' portfolios are very diversified. So, first of all, I guess, we really appreciate the disclosure on the residential infrastructure strength. But I guess my question is like, is there something unique to your business that gives you the visibility into which markets are performing better or worse than maybe your peers don't have?\nRob Painter: I think there is a \u2013 what we've built \u2013 our strategy is fundamentally to connect users' data and workflow across industry continuums. In construction, we work with architects, engineers, contractors, and owners across the life cycle from design to build to operate. So, we have a business that focuses on architects and designers, let's say, in engineering and construction. We work with mechanical, electrical, plumbing, steel, concrete, contractors. So, we have visibility into the trades inside of MEP. We can look at the digital supply chain to connect an estimate and a design model actually out to the components that you ultimately buy and transact as you create those estimates. In the construction side, we both \u2013 we obviously work in civil construction as well as building construction and our Viewpoint software. It's the system of record. It's the ERP. So, we know what kind of businesses our customers are in, and we can get a meta view of the employees they have of the backlog that they have of the work that we're doing. And then on the owner side, even though I'm describing that as the last one in the chain, the owners actually are at the beginning of the chain, and we have a set of businesses that are managing capital programs and asset management and permitting. So, I think Trimble has a more unique view as compared to any other peer that we have in the industry given how we serve specific personas across the industry life cycle. And so, we can see activity at a level of specificity that I think would be quite unique.\nJosh Tilton: Much appreciated. Thank you guys so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason of Baird. Your line is open.\nRob Mason: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Rob, you talked about the work that you'll be doing this year to transition some of your ag channel to more independent dealers. How can we track your progress or what markers should we be watching, I guess, leading up to that transition of the channel? And would you expect that the net effect of that transition this year to be neutral or positive or negative on 2023?\nRob Painter: Well, we would see the transition this year. I guess I would characterize as neutral to perhaps a little positive. I can tell you qualitatively, the feedback we're getting in the market is quite positive. We are having success, good early success of signing up dealers who want to work with Trimble both existing dealers and new dealers who see good business opportunities here. If you think about what's unique about what we can do in from an aftermarket perspective as we have kits available for 10,000 different machines. That's pretty darn unique to be able to do that. When I spend time out in the field with dealers and with the farmers, they are looking for support. Like \u2013 and I mean support from people who know technology and how it works, not support from iron but support from technology. And so, we get very \u2013 we're getting very good feedback that we need to work with you. We want to work with you because you know how to \u2013 you know technology, you know how to support it. You're on the machine types. And by the way, Trimble, you have the full portfolio, a broader technology portfolio. We don't just do steering and guidance, we do implement controls. We do water management. We have software. We have selective spring. And so, those have been the positives that are so far, I'd say, creating good progress for us as we transition the channel. To your question about proof points as an investor and analyst, you can track the progress of that. Let us take that as an action item of how we can provide more quantitative color around that. Obviously, you'll see the face of the financials and revenue and margin progression against what we're \u2013 against what we're saying, but let us take that as a topic for what additional disclosure would make sense going forward.\nRob Mason: That's helpful. That's helpful. Just as a follow-up around Transporeon. Obviously, it's European-centric. How should we think about your ability and maybe pace of the ability to leverage that platform and penetrate other geographies in North America, in particular, I guess? And how would your approach necessarily need to differ if it would to build a network outside of Europe versus what they have done in Europe?\nRob Painter: Sure. So, actually I'll start in Europe. So, we had prior to the acquisition, we had a relatively small carrier business. So, mobility business for carriers. We will combine that business with Transporeon. That will make sense. One, because Transporeon obviously works with shippers and carriers, we think we can get a stronger European carrier business if those businesses are working together. Within Europe, we have underlying technology that we can replace third parties with Trimble technology and bring a modest amount of cost synergy to the business within Europe. And within Europe, it's been really interesting to see some of the phone calls that we've got, some of which may have been positive surprises from forestry companies saying, Hey, actually, I need help because they're already working with us in forestry.  We need help with the transportation and logistics, how can we connect this with forestry. We've heard the same thing with building construction where you're looking for visibility to understand when that construction supply chain components are going to show up to a job site. So, we're encouraged that some early inquiry that we've received within Europe. Now, let's go outside of Europe and North America would be the obvious place to go given the centricity of revenue that we already have in North America. And so, the teams are actively working together to bring I'd say, a couple of aspects of Transporeon technology around automated procurement or autonomous procurement into the U.S. market or North American market this year, some of those quick win-type opportunities. I was in Brazil in January. And what we discovered there is, we have \u2013 our Trimble already has a telematics business or mobility business in Brazil, Transporeon has a small operation in Brazil doing freight audit, that becomes something that we can connect together given the geography we're already in. So, where we're already in, geographies that's an easier play to bring capabilities together. I'd say the new, new geography, those tend to be slower and harder and would not, in this environment, be my first priority, where to allocate capital.\nRob Mason: That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate the response. Thank you.\nOperator: As there are no further questions, I would like to thank our speakers for today's presentation, and thank you all for joining us.

            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website; and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Let's begin on Slide 2 with our key messages. Annualized recurring revenue is our key top line metric at Trimble. Our team led by our construction software group achieved 13% organic growth in the quarter, 100 basis points ahead of our expectations.  We now stand at 1.65 billion of ARR, which compares to 1.2 billion when we began our Connect and Scale journey in 2020 and under 700 million at the beginning of 2017. Kudos to the Trimble team who have worked so hard to execute on our transformation. EBITDA is our other key P&L metric, and we delivered EBITDA of 27.2%, also slightly ahead of our expectations, which was driven by record gross margins of 64.2%. For perspective, gross margins in 2019 were 57.7% and 56.3% in 2016. Free cash flow conversion of 1.14x was also ahead of our expectations. I recognize that consensus numbers and the trading algorithm both still focus on total revenue and EPS. While these figures are important, they are secondary in relevance to ARR and cash flow, which are much more closely tied to fundamental value creation. Revenue and margins were both above expectations we set with the investor community back in February. We believe the delta to consensus figures was simply a function of the challenge in getting our quarters mapped correctly against our annual guidance. As a result, we will be more prescriptive with our second quarter commentary. With respect to the macro, like most companies, we are navigating an economic environment with a heightened sense of uncertainty trying to find the signal through the noise. Despite the noise, what we sell to customers is productivity, quality, safety, transparency, and environmental sustainability. The mid-to-long term secular tailwinds remain strong in the industries we serve. They are large global industries that are underserved and underpenetrated and they will continue to digitally transform. Our strategy compels us to be mindful of our cost structure in the short-term, while continuing to invest in our most attractive long-term opportunities. With respect to capital allocation, there are three main points. First, we divested three small businesses in the first quarter, bringing the total to 16 since 2020. Second, our recent B2W and Ryvit deals are both off to a strong start and performing ahead of expectations. Third, the investment we are making in our business transformation has initially been focused towards our software businesses. 1.65 billion of ARR growing double-digit in this climate as a proof point of high quality capital allocation. We are transforming our go to market motions to deliver bundled and connected solutions, while building the systems and processes to efficiently and effectively scale our business. At the company level, we think about our Rule of 40 as the sum of ARR growth and EBITDA margin, which represents our aspirational bar. Many of our software businesses have already cleared this hurdle, while others are steering this direction. Looking at our hardware businesses, this is where we have felt the whipsaw of supply chain availability and channel inventory stabilization, which continues to make quarterly comparisons of our numbers incomplete at best. To find the signal, you have to look at a multi-year view. Our largest hardware businesses and agriculture civil construction and geospatial, collectively grew revenues at a mid-single-digit rate from the first quarter of 2019 through the quarter of 2023. In the first quarter, channel inventories continued to draw down, thus retail demand significantly exceeded wholesale demand. Moving to Slide 3, let's look at the progression of our Connect and Scale strategy through the lens of our reporting segments beginning with buildings and infrastructure. Market backdrop generally remains healthy. In North America, we see strength in infrastructure and non-residential construction such as data centers, renewable energy, and manufacturing, slightly offset by pressure on residential. Customer backlogs remain healthy and technology helps to address the skilled worker shortage. By the numbers, ACB bookings grew double-digits in the quarter and ahead of plan, while ARR grew in excess of the company growth rate. Our Trimble Construction One commercial offering is helping to grow new logo and cross-sell bookings and our next wave of systems automation will be released in the next few weeks. Through the lens of strategic progression, customer wins at England's National Highways and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration demonstrate customers want integrated Trimble offerings. At CONEXPO, our technology was present on 20 OEM booths, demonstrating the continued relevance of the mix fleet. In our introduction of an all-in-one system for on machine excavator guidance insight serving, demonstrates that we can continue to expand the size of the addressable market by virtue of reaching new machine categories. In geospatial, the market backdrop is generally the same as buildings and infrastructure with a higher mix of residential exposure, which presents a headwind. Managing channel inventory levels is a priority in this segment. By the numbers, revenue was ahead of our internal expectations in the quarter. Strategically speaking, we continue to see strong demand from U.S. State Department of Transportation and we see product lines such as mobile mapping showing solid growth. In resources and utilities, while farmer sentiment has been dropping, the market fundamentals continue to be healthy. Commodity prices remain high by historical standards and input costs are moderating. Strategically speaking, we are on the path towards building out our aftermarket distribution and agriculture. We believe in giving farmers a choice in their technology platforms and we believe in the power of independent technology dealers where we have the direct relationship. While there's a lot of work ahead of us, feedback from current and prospective partners is positive, We know how to build and manage a channel that reference our SITECH model in civil construction and a similar initiative in our geospatial channel as case studies and excellence of channel development. In the quarter, we also announced advanced path planning technology, which takes us a step further on the path toward fully autonomous equipment for a variety of industries. In our positioning services business, we announced that Nissan has gone live with the most advanced driver assist system to date, which is enabled by Trimble positioning technology. This is another example of Connect and Scale, taking a core Trimble technology and applying it across new and existing verticals. By the numbers, we were largely unplanned this quarter. In transportation, the market backdrop is very dynamic with a softening freight market pressuring carriers to find new frontiers of efficiency which technology can help address. By the numbers, we met our expectations in the quarter and we have delivered five sequential quarterly increases and operating income as a percent of revenue. Strategically speaking, we are making progress with our new In-Cab technology platform, which delivers the open platform that our customers have been asking for. We launched new functionality in the quarter, including the first industry dwell time metrics for fleet management, which provides customers with additional metrics they can use to improve their operational efficiency. The biggest news for us in transportation was closing of the Transporeon deal on April 3. I've described this business as a perfect example of a platform play within our strategy. The why, comes in the form of a network of over 158,000 carriers and over 1,400 shippers transacting approximately \u20ac55 billion of freight on an annual basis. Every day, over 110,000 transports and over 100,000 docs scheduling appointments are managed on the Transporeon platform. Slide 4 provides a summary overview of how we see the complementary aspects coming together to create a stronger franchise. In the form of complementary capabilities, customers, and geographic reach. The business model of Transporeon is fundamentally a consumption based model based on an array of transaction fees. Since we announced the deal in December, demand in Europe has slowed. And the mix has shifted towards a greater percentage of contract over spot transactions, which are monetized at a lower rate. Our guidance reflects what we believe is a de-risked 2023 level of dollar denominated revenue, approximately 10% below what we communicated in December. While this is disappointing there are also positive signals. Bookings are still expected to grow well over 30% for the year. Market share is holding, customer churn is almost non-existent and our tax rate assumption improved and cross-selling opportunities with Trimble are looking stronger than they did just a few months ago. Let me now turn the call over to David to take us through the numbers. When we think about our right to win at Trimble, we believe we can uniquely bring together users and connect workflow between the physical and digital worlds across industry continuums. Connect and Scale is our strategy. Our strategy is a platform strategy. The platform strategy is in turn a data strategy. If we are successful in our pursuits, we will collect one of the most complete data sets in and across industries, creating a flywheel of enhanced insights and data connectivity. AI has captured the world's attention, ours too. We believe our corpus of industry-specific data will unlock and accelerate our long-term value creation model. As I conclude my remarks, I want to take a moment to honor the memory of Sandra MacQuillan, who passed away last week after a year's long battle with cancer. Sandra was a dedicated member of our Board and was a valuable contributor to our company's success. Sandra's insight, courage, and support for our business will be greatly missed. She helped make Trimble a better company. She helped me to become a better leader. On behalf of the entire Trimble team, I extend our deepest condolences to Sandra's family and loved ones.  Operator, let's open the line to questions. Hi, Jerry. Kristen, I'll add a comment on the data strategy, part of your question. And I start with the corpus of data at Trimble and construction, we manage over $1 trillion of construction projects and ag, we manage over technology and over 180 million acres of farmland and transportation. We manage a couple of million vehicles on the road, and that's even pre-Transporeon, and our geospatial business fundamentally is about creating a digital model of the physical earth. So there's, I'd say, a profound corpus of data opportunities. Our digital transformation, a big part of that is unlocking that data, getting it into the cloud. Once you've got it in a cloud, I have the opportunity to take data into information. And then when we're thinking about artificial intelligence, we've been playing in this arena for a while, it's quite exciting. It's actually also quite fun. We're already developing predictive and generative AI-based solutions covering all of our end markets and covering a number of workflows within that. And I will still say, we are very, very early in the journey. So, if you take a market like agriculture, with the Bilberry acquisition that we did on selective spring, we're applying deep learning technology to be able to identify [weeds] [ph] and enable spraying at the plant level instead of at the field level in our Viewpoint business and construction, we're applying natural language processing to automate invoicing processing workflows. In the Geospatial business, we're working on already point cloud semantic segmentation so then you can automatically extract and classify assets from large data sets and in our transportation business. We have video intelligence solutions that can detect fatigue and driver distraction and therefore, improve the safety, and we're just at the beginning of this. From a competitive standpoint, the thing that is most singularly unique about Trimble, and I think forms the basis of our right to win in our markets is our ability to connect the physical and the digital world. So, it's connecting work in the office with work in the field. That means connecting the hardware and the software of Trimble. And I think in that respect, we're singularly unique. When I think about potential OEM disintermediation, I go to the customer, that customer is a farmer, it's a contractor, it's a trucking company. More often than not, they're looking for a neutral provider of technology to operate across a mixed fleet. And we don't see that fundamentally changing in the aftermarket, and we hear more customers saying, how is this going to work for me if I have OEM proprietary technology, multiple OEM proprietary technology? Because remember, they operate mixed fleets. How does that benefit a customer? That's what we hear feedback from out in the field, and it gives me conviction that we're on the right path. Now, does that mean that, that will \u2013 that OEMs would not, let's say, pursue a strategy, I'd say, of course, not. We just have to be able to innovate faster and show that value of the connection between the physical and the digital world. That's why for the last 15 years, 20 years, we've been creating a software ecosystem around that hardware that we have to create these integrated and connected workflows. Not to mention that's the technology side of it. And then you apply the go-to-market aspect of you actually take this to market, how you actually monetize what are the business models around it, where are the data insights that you can unlock from this. So, I'd say, yes, there is certainly a different competitive environment that exists today versus 5, 10, 15 years ago. And I think a lot of the let's say, competitive world woke up to the attractiveness of these markets that we're serving that are large, global, underserved and underpenetrated. So, we feel good about where we stand in that environment, Kristen. So Jonathan, this is Rob. Good morning. From, I'd say, if I look at the financials of the business, whether that's the overall growth of the business, the gross margins, the ARR growth in the business, the bookings growth in the business, we see those as accretive to the to the business model of overall Trimble that doesn't change. And then our view is \u2013 continues to be look at the mid-term and beyond, and it will be even more significantly accretive given the nature of the platform and the density that the business has of carriers and shippers. To the second question on what changed in the macro view. And I'd say, yes, absolutely, it's disappointing from my perspective as well. When we break down the underlying factors, we looked and saw a couple of things, and maybe three things to mention. The first is the overall level of transactions has gone down in Europe. And when we look at the end markets, markets like CPG, retail, chemicals or three relatively big markets for the business. The transaction volume slowed more than we expected. CPG, I look at that one is one that people are still going to eat. So, I don't lose a conviction that this is a temporary phenomenon in the business. The second aspect, which really probably also relates to the third is the spot prices have come down and the business differentially monetizes when spot rates are higher. So, spot rates will come down if transaction volume comes down. The third piece, which connects actually though, back to spot prices, is that truck capacity went up in Europe and so if you follow new unit trucks hitting the market in Europe, that capacity increased at the same time as the transaction slowed further pressuring spot prices. So, those would be the three factors. But now let me not end on that note, let me end on the note that we expect to see 30% bookings growth in the business this year. When we look at prior economic cycles in the business, this business has accelerated out of each of those cycles. It's fundamentally a transaction-oriented business. There's no loss of customers. In fact, when rates are strong as ever, 40 new customers were onboarded onto the platform in the first quarter before we owned it. So, the underlying fundamentals of the quality, I would say, of the business are there. And we believe it would be poised to as a bounce back when the markets improve. And Jonathan, the thing I'd add to that is the nature of the technology at Trimble is that it's mission-critical. You're using it most of the day. It's not a nice to have on the shelf-type software that you can easily get rid of. Sure, Chad. Hey, this is Rob. So the 13% was at the company level of organic ARR growth that we see going up through the rest of the year. If we go into Buildings and Infrastructure, specifically, the Buildings and Infrastructure grows, ARR has been growing faster than that company average. And we expect that to grow throughout the year as well in Buildings and Infrastructure. When we go through the business reviews, and one of the things that is, I'd say, great about an ARR business model is, we closed in the quarter at $1.65 billion of ARR. And by the way, that's a conservative view of ARR. We don't take the contracted ARR view at the end of the quarter, which would be higher. But we wake up on the first day of the second quarter, and we've got line of sight to $1.65 billion of revenue going forward for the next year. And you can see that show up in the remaining performance obligations. And so, when we look at the businesses, you can get a bit scientific about it because you can go and do a go get analysis. You understand the revenue you're walking in with whether it's a quarter or a year or multi-year period. You know get delta that you have to close in order to hit the ARR forecast. Against that delta, you look at a pipeline that you have a bookings pipeline and then it's a conversion ratio of that bookings pipeline to what can hit short-term ARR versus will become deferred revenue that's monetized over time. Now, within that, if I take Buildings and Infrastructure, specifically, cross-sell and upsell are significantly driving business for us, the bookings of business that we have. What we're seeing is that we're bringing on new logos as we go to market as One Trimble through this Trimble Construction One offering. We're seeing cross-sell between Viewpoint and Tekla. We're seeing it from our bid-to-win acquisition and the Viewpoint business. We're seeing it from Viewpoint and our MEP business. I'm just really proud of the team who's put in the work to define the business model offerings and to organize the go-to-market efforts and the sales enablement behind that to actually execute on a vision. It's easy to have a division. The work happens behind the scenes to bring it to life. And the team is \u2013 continues to deliver proof points that we're on the right track here. We're seeing higher win rates in the deals in the market. We're seeing larger deal sizes when we go to market as One Trimble, we're seeing shorter sales cycles when we do it. So, I like the setup. We expect to continue to see strong growth. Buildings and Infrastructure and the construction software within that, that's the tip of the spear for the transformation at Trimble. We're putting really I'd say the strong, strong majority of our efforts behind making that business successful and using that as a template for the rest of the organization. And I think the last thing I would say is, ultimately, we're taking dollars to the bank, not percentages. These numbers continue to get bigger and bigger. So, posting strong double-digit growth on a larger base, I think is worth noting, David, I think, mentioned in his comments that we could expect to see $2 billion of ARR by the end of the year and Buildings and Infrastructure would presumably be about half of that. Sorry, Chad, do you mean at a company level? Or do you mean at a segment level? Well, from a segment perspective, we \u2013 outside of Resources and Utilities actually very little goes through OEMs. It's in the single-digit percentage in the Resource and Utilities. Of course, that's agriculture. And I think we've said about 25%. Hi, good morning, Tami. It's Rob. Well, we've been working in this space as you know for a long time, both predominantly in the aftermarket, but with one OEM in our transportation business, in the short-term, we don't see a change to the business that we have with our OEM partner. Long-term or actually even mid-to-long term, the exact nature of the upgrades we're making on our technology in the transportation business is to deliver the open platform that customers in the aftermarket have been looking for. Back to an earlier conversation we're having in the Q&A on mix fleets. The same dynamic happens with trucking companies most are operating multiple \u2013 yes, multiple truck OEMs within their fleet even different engine types. So, you can have really quite different configurations, different configuration perform better at different parts of the country. What you would need here in Colorado and the mountains is a different machine or I'd say a different truck performed \u2013 is optimized better here than it is in a different part of the country. And so, we continue to see customers looking to integrate mixed fleets. When you have that open platform that can come out of the OEMs, when they have that openness, you can put in a Trimble or a Trimble competitor technology and user interface on top of that. So, I think it's an equalizer in the market. I can add a little color to that. I encourage you to separate the software businesses from the hardware businesses and that analysis. If you look at the software business. I submit there's 1.65 billion reasons to have conviction in our view of the rest of the year, and that's because that's the ARR. And again, that's not even a contracted ARR, which would be higher than that, 1.6 billion of backlog or those remaining performance obligations as well gives us visibility. We know the bookings we have. It's really a bit of a science to translate to bookings into the recognized revenue. So, our conviction and our predictability on that stream of our revenue is going to be the highest. And then I think you take separately the hardware businesses, which David walked you through. We've been through dynamics of the dealer inventory stabilization. Now, let's look at the macros around it. And I think that's a fair question to test our conviction on this. [Take agriculture,] [ph] we see farm income being healthy this year. We take North America construction, and we see the infrastructure bill being providing a tailwind the business. So, those are the kind of factors that go into our view for the rest of the year. And certainly then would become the things that we have to watch and then we'll update you on again next quarter. I think there is a \u2013 what we've built \u2013 our strategy is fundamentally to connect users' data and workflow across industry continuums. In construction, we work with architects, engineers, contractors, and owners across the life cycle from design to build to operate. So, we have a business that focuses on architects and designers, let's say, in engineering and construction. We work with mechanical, electrical, plumbing, steel, concrete, contractors. So, we have visibility into the trades inside of MEP. We can look at the digital supply chain to connect an estimate and a design model actually out to the components that you ultimately buy and transact as you create those estimates. In the construction side, we both \u2013 we obviously work in civil construction as well as building construction and our Viewpoint software. It's the system of record. It's the ERP. So, we know what kind of businesses our customers are in, and we can get a meta view of the employees they have of the backlog that they have of the work that we're doing. And then on the owner side, even though I'm describing that as the last one in the chain, the owners actually are at the beginning of the chain, and we have a set of businesses that are managing capital programs and asset management and permitting. So, I think Trimble has a more unique view as compared to any other peer that we have in the industry given how we serve specific personas across the industry life cycle. And so, we can see activity at a level of specificity that I think would be quite unique. Well, we would see the transition this year. I guess I would characterize as neutral to perhaps a little positive. I can tell you qualitatively, the feedback we're getting in the market is quite positive. We are having success, good early success of signing up dealers who want to work with Trimble both existing dealers and new dealers who see good business opportunities here. If you think about what's unique about what we can do in from an aftermarket perspective as we have kits available for 10,000 different machines. That's pretty darn unique to be able to do that. When I spend time out in the field with dealers and with the farmers, they are looking for support. Like \u2013 and I mean support from people who know technology and how it works, not support from iron but support from technology. And so, we get very \u2013 we're getting very good feedback that we need to work with you. We want to work with you because you know how to \u2013 you know technology, you know how to support it. You're on the machine types. And by the way, Trimble, you have the full portfolio, a broader technology portfolio. We don't just do steering and guidance, we do implement controls. We do water management. We have software. We have selective spring. And so, those have been the positives that are so far, I'd say, creating good progress for us as we transition the channel. To your question about proof points as an investor and analyst, you can track the progress of that. Let us take that as an action item of how we can provide more quantitative color around that. Obviously, you'll see the face of the financials and revenue and margin progression against what we're \u2013 against what we're saying, but let us take that as a topic for what additional disclosure would make sense going forward. Sure. So, actually I'll start in Europe. So, we had prior to the acquisition, we had a relatively small carrier business. So, mobility business for carriers. We will combine that business with Transporeon. That will make sense. One, because Transporeon obviously works with shippers and carriers, we think we can get a stronger European carrier business if those businesses are working together. Within Europe, we have underlying technology that we can replace third parties with Trimble technology and bring a modest amount of cost synergy to the business within Europe. And within Europe, it's been really interesting to see some of the phone calls that we've got, some of which may have been positive surprises from forestry companies saying, Hey, actually, I need help because they're already working with us in forestry.  We need help with the transportation and logistics, how can we connect this with forestry. We've heard the same thing with building construction where you're looking for visibility to understand when that construction supply chain components are going to show up to a job site. So, we're encouraged that some early inquiry that we've received within Europe. Now, let's go outside of Europe and North America would be the obvious place to go given the centricity of revenue that we already have in North America. And so, the teams are actively working together to bring I'd say, a couple of aspects of Transporeon technology around automated procurement or autonomous procurement into the U.S. market or North American market this year, some of those quick win-type opportunities. I was in Brazil in January. And what we discovered there is, we have \u2013 our Trimble already has a telematics business or mobility business in Brazil, Transporeon has a small operation in Brazil doing freight audit, that becomes something that we can connect together given the geography we're already in. So, where we're already in, geographies that's an easier play to bring capabilities together. I'd say the new, new geography, those tend to be slower and harder and would not, in this environment, be my first priority, where to allocate capital."

            "name": "David Barnes",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. I'll start on Slide 5. First quarter revenue of 915 million was above our expectations coming into the quarter. I'll remind you that revenues were exceptionally strong early last year as we recovered from our supply chain challenges and worked to bring down backlog. So, our comps this quarter were difficult. Our organic revenue decline in the first quarter is entirely attributable to reductions in dealer inventories. Gross margins were exceptionally strong in the quarter. As Rob mentioned, our 64.2% gross margins are a record in the history of Trimble reflecting both an accelerated mix toward higher margin software offerings and the positive net impact of price realization and lower input costs for our hardware products. Gross margins in the first quarter benefited from a high level of term license renewals in several of our software businesses so we expect some moderation from this high level in the coming quarters. While we continued to spend in the quarter against our strategic initiatives, our strong performance on the gross margin line led to higher EBITDA and operating margins, up 170 basis points and 120 basis points respectively versus prior year. We are pleased with our ability to drive high margins even in a tough environment and as we invest in our business.  Cash flow in the quarter improved significantly year-on-year with both cash flow from operations and free cash flow in excess of non-GAAP net income. Our improved cash generation reflects a reduction in cash outflow for hardware component purchases and lower incentive compensation. Note that we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter and will continue the suspension of share repurchases until we have paid down a meaningful portion of the debt raised fund the Transporeon acquisition. Turning now to Slide 6 for some perspective on the underlying drivers of our revenue trends. I'd like to call your attention to a change we have made in the presentation of our revenue breakout on our financial statements. Going forward, our revenue will be broken out in two components. The first category is products, while the second category is subscriptions and services. Product revenue consists of hardware offerings, and our non-recurring perpetual software, while subscription and services revenue is predominantly recurring. In presenting our revenue in this way, we are being responsive to investors who increasingly think of our growth separately in recurring and non-recurring revenues. We think this new presentation is better aligned with our strategy going forward. Product revenue, including hardware and perpetual software was down 15% organically in the first quarter. The decline in product revenue this quarter reflects a tough comparison with the first quarter of 2022, when our supply chain was freeing up and we were working through extraordinarily high backlog. Our dealers reduced their inventories as expected in the first quarter of this year and we estimate that dealer inventory reductions accounted for roughly 40 million or nearly half of our product revenue decline. Subscription and services revenue was up 14% on an organic basis. To put our first quarter revenue performance into a longitudinal perspective, it is instructive to look at the compound growth back to 2019 before the impacts of COVID and supply chain swings. In this view, total revenue compounded at a 5% rate in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2019. From a geographic perspective, revenue was down 9% organically in Europe. Nearly half of the Europe revenue decline can be attributed to our decision to exit our Russia business. In North America and Asia Pacific, our revenues in the quarter were essentially flat, while revenue in the rest of world grew 6% driven by strong demand from agriculture customers in Latin America. Turning now to Slide 7, we ended the first quarter with ARR at 1.65 billion, up 13% organically. Backlog of 1.6 billion was up slightly versus the prior quarter and down from 1.7 billion a year ago. Hardware and perpetual software related backlog was down 200 million year-over-year, driven by our dramatically improved lead times. Recurring related backlog was up over 100 million year-over-year and up 40 million sequentially due to our growing bookings of recurring solutions. On a 12-month rolling basis, our software services and recurring revenue of 2.2 billion represents 62% of our revenue, up 700 basis points from year ago levels. As we near the completion of the Transporeon acquisition, we did so from a strong balance sheet position with net debt at approximately 1.1x EBITDA. Turning now to results by segment on Slide 8, our software portfolio and buildings and infrastructure had a strong quarter with ARR, up organically by approximately 20%. Segment revenue to our civil construction customers, which are predominantly made up of hardware, were down year-on-year in the quarter as expected as our dealers worked down their inventories. Excluding the impact of dealer inventory changes, we estimate that our retail sales of civil construction offerings were up in the quarter at a high-single-digit rate, reflecting a favorable environment for infrastructure investment. In total, buildings and infrastructure saw 5% organic revenue growth with operating margins over 28%. Transportation segment revenues grew year-on-year organically in the quarter, while operating margins exceeded 15%. Importantly ARR grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter for this segment. The turnaround of our transportation business is underway and we are encouraged by the continuous improvement in ARR growth, revenue growth, and operating margins. In the Resources and Utilities segment, revenue was down organically as expected. Like our other hardware centric businesses, R&U revenue trends were impacted significantly by tough comps with prior. In the first quarter of 2022, R&U revenues grew 16% organically as our supply chain freed up and we worked to bring down backlog. On a [full-year basis] [ph], first quarter revenues were up at a compound annual growth rate of just over 6%. Segment margins were extremely strong in the quarter, reflecting lower input cost and the benefit of higher price realization. In the geospatial segment, which is also heavily dependent on hardware, we saw revenue down 16% on an organic basis in the quarter, but modestly better than our forecast. More than half of the year-on-year organic revenue decline for the segment relates to dealer inventory dynamics as dealers reduce their overall inventory levels this year. Geospatial revenues grew organically by over 16% in the first quarter of last year as we brought down backlog. Our geospatial business has felt the slowdown in residential home construction, which has impacted many of our survey customers. I'll now turn to guidance on Slide 9, where we have a number of moving pieces. We are updating our annual guidance to bridge the addition of Transporeon for the remainder of the year. We are also being more prescriptive with our view in the second quarter with the addition of Transporeon. Let's start with the annual outlook pre-Transporeon where we are confirming our baseline guidance view for the business, including our outlook for mid-teens organic ARR growth and full-year organic revenue growth of 2% to 5%. Incorporating Transporeon, we expect the addition of approximately 135 million in revenues over the balance of the year and approximately 175 million of ARR by the end of the year. As such, we now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of 3.835 billion to 3.935 billion. We project that our ARR, including Transporeon will be approximately 2 billion at the end of 2023. We continue to expect the gross margins will expand in the range of 300 basis points for the year versus 2022, coming down sequentially in the second quarter and then progressing up again in the second half of the year. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Our guidance now assumes a more favorable tax rate than our last forecast based on a more favorable outlook on our tax rate from the Transporeon acquisition. Our updated outlook for earnings per share is in the range of $2.52 to $2.72, reflecting a mid-single-digit percentage dilution from Transporeon and related interest expense, which is in-line with what we indicated in December. We continue to expect the Transporeon will be roughly neutral to 2024 EPS and accretive thereafter. We affirm our free cash flow projection for the year of approximately 1x non-GAAP net income, reflecting in part our plan to reduce inventory levels. Shortly after the close of the Transporeon acquisition, our pro forma net leverage stood at approximately 3.25x with approximately $3.1 billion in net debt. The debt we raised in connection with our Transporeon acquisition carries an interest rate of approximately 6.3%, in-line with our expectations at the time the deal was announced. Given our current cash flow projections, we expect to end 2023 with leverage under 3x. We said in our announcement of the Transporeon acquisition that we expected to restore leverage to below 2.5x within 18 months to 24 months following the acquisition. Our updated projections suggest that we will be able to de-lever to our 2.5x goal sooner than that original time line. Turning to the second quarter. The midpoint of our guidance reflects a return to organic revenue growth with revenue between $962 million and $992 million and EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.61. We expect the impact of additional dealer inventory reductions in the second quarter will be about half the rate of the first quarter with stocking levels at or near normal levels by the end of June. We expect that our gross margin percentage will be lower sequentially in the second quarter, due to lower term license revenue and a higher share of hardware. Operating margins will also be down sequentially to approximately 22%, reflecting both lower gross margins and higher operating expense from annual salary increases. Looking at the back half of the year, we expect higher rates of ARR and revenue growth. We expect revenue to increase sequentially from the second quarter through the fourth quarter. We project that the fourth quarter will be our best of the year across the key metrics of financial performance, including total revenue, ARR growth, organic revenue growth, and operating margins. As it relates to our view on segment growth throughout the rest of the year, we expect all four of our segments to post improving, sequential, organic ARR, and revenue growth through the balance of 2023. Buildings and Infrastructure will remain our fastest-growing segment as we expect our recurring software businesses to sustain solid performance while our civil hardware business improves with more normalized dealer inventories. We expect our geospatial segment to return to positive organic growth in the second half of the year, but remain modestly down for the full-year. We expect resources and utilities to return to growth late in the second half of the year, driven by an expected pickup in our aftermarket channels. Over to you, Rob. Sure. Jerry, it's David. There no fundamental change in the momentum of the business \u2013 recurring business in Buildings and Infrastructure. It happens to be the case that in the first quarter, that's when the term licenses renew. And so, if you're going to have churn, that's when you have it. And that factor will abate and we expect to end the year actually a little north of 20% for Buildings and Infrastructure ARR. So, the momentum is solid. Yes, you're right, mid-teens. I'll try not to be too specific, but it's north of 13%. So yes, we project that ARR growth will accelerate for the balance of the year. Yes. So first, the 10% refers to will have \u2013 we project 10% less revenue than you could have extrapolated from the directional indication we gave in December. It's still growing. It's just growing a little more slowly than we'd expect. From a margin perspective, we indicated that EBITDA margins would be about 30%. I still think that's the long-term trend, but we've lost a little bit of fixed cost leverage. Probably the simplest way to think about that for the year, Jerry, is Transporeon margins will be pretty close to the Trimble average this year and then higher as the business gets back to growth or higher levels of growth. Yes. There's two big factors that drove gross margin up significantly in the quarter. One is, as you said, the mix shift is very favorable because our hardware business was down and the software business was up, but an equally important factor is that we're way past the hump of our inflationary cycle in our hardware businesses. In fact, year-on-year, our input costs are down. We were heavily dependent on expedited freight in the broker market for parts a year ago, and we've got more price realization. So, we have seen a pretty important improvement in the margins within our hardware portfolio. Well, we're investing in our business. The guidance and the script comments reflect. We don't think the gross margins will stay at the high level they were in Q1 for the rest of the year. We'll be modestly below that, partly because the mix comes back to a more normalized mix as our hardware businesses get past the hump of dealer inventory reductions. But look, if you look at our operating expense, even for \u2013 with the year's outlook, we will grow OpEx faster than revenue.  We normally don't like to do that, but we're investing against our business. Part of it is R&D. Part of it is against the digital transformation, the creation of platforms. So, we are investing against the business even while we get through the noise of the supply chain and the higher gross margins helps us do that. Sure. I'd say the pace of inventory, destock is exactly what we thought it would be a quarter ago, and we'll be essentially all the way through it by mid-year. We're on the plan on destocking that we laid out a quarter ago. And yes, I think that answers your question. And that's true for our businesses in aggregate, so including the ag business. I'll comment on pacing and Rob can add on the data strategy. So, we're about to cross an important milestone where we've put into production, the digital backbone for our North American enterprise software business for the construction industry, so that will go live next week. And what that does, Kristen, is systematically enables the TC1 bundles that we've been selling in a sort of [indiscernible] way to date.  And we've had success in the [indiscernible] approach, but we're about to cross an important milestone in what we call digitally-enabled Trimble construction one with bundles that are more accessible and easier for our people to sell and our customers to consume. This is part of the journey we're on. We have additional rollout scheduled for our digital transformation that over the next couple of years will benefit the whole of our business. So, we're going to see some tangible \u2013 much more tangible benefits from the investments we've been making on digital transformation. Jonathan, you're talking about for the company as a whole? Yes. I'll focus on the outlook for the year. We expect net retention to be very strong, north of 100% in the ZIP code of 110%. What gets us there? Our churn varies by business and most of our recurring businesses the churn is very low in the low to mid-single digits. SketchUp is structurally higher than that, but we generate the positive net retention pushing at high-single-digits through low churn and upsell and cross-sell of new offerings. And as Rob mentioned, the uniqueness of the breadth of our offering, we're really having traction in the building software portfolio of cross-selling, Viewpoint and our ]Technostructures] [ph] and MEP offerings. And so, that's what gets net retention into the high single-digit range. 100-plus high single digits. Hi, Chad. It was a little higher than that in 2022 because actually, our business through OEMs was particularly strong. So, it was about a third of our R&U segment. And it's held up well, I'll say. So, our business with OEMs is strong right now. Yes. I don't think it's additional versus any longer-term trend. It's just that the term licenses, it's actually a bit of a factor of our old technology that we're improving with our new digital infrastructure, but the terms all coincide on January 1. So, if you're going to churn as a customer, you churn on January 1. So, it's \u2013 I call that a blip. That factor won't recur in any of the coming quarters. And we think we're on the sustained trend of solid ARR growth for Buildings and Infrastructure. As Rob said, it was about 20%, and we think it will end the year a little more than where we were in Q1. I wouldn't say it's older solutions. It's solutions that are enabled by our older infrastructure technology as we roll-out our digital infrastructure, we could be more flexible in how our licensing models work, and we won't have the situation where our terms all in at the same time, which isn't convenient for us or even for some of our customers. So, that's how things will improve. Yes. So it's $135 million for the three quarters, a little less than a third of that. Around 30% will be in Q2 and corresponding you'll have a little more than a third in Q4. Welcome. Yes. Tami, it's David. There is some seasonality in the business. Historically, it's strongest in the fourth quarter. There's a lot of goods that flow closer to the holiday season. But I don't \u2013 there's also some underlying growth. So, the way I would suggest you look at it the way we look at it is of the 135 million, we'll have roughly 30% in Q2, a third in Q3 and a little more than a third of Q4. Hey, Josh, David Barnes. I'll start. So the Transporeon business model, as Rob mentioned, is transaction-based, principally not a subscription. So, our software offerings, as Rob discussed earlier, are mission-critical for our customers and are much less susceptible to any short-term trend in the end customers ongoing transaction or ongoing level of business. Our view is that there's some puts and takes, but the aggregate demand we see for our business has not changed over the last 90 days. We do see some signs that in a few of our end markets, actually, the overall macro outlook is improving. I look at Geospatial, for instance, we assess our dealers for their sentiment. We talked to some of their customers in the survey business. They're feeling a little better than they were. Input costs are abating. So, overall, we're very confident with the outlook for the rest of the business that we articulated a quarter ago. Transporeon is impacted by the particular macros of Europe and the end markets they serve."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Novi [ph] and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble Third Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Rob Painter, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nRob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons which refer to the corresponding period of the prior year, unless otherwise noted. In addition, our P&L commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis which excludes our agriculture business. Let's start on Slide 4. During the third quarter, we continued to advance our Connect & Scale strategy. The Connect aspect of the strategy guides us to digitally connect users, data and workflows across stakeholders in the engineering and construction and transportation and logistics industries. The Scale aspect of the strategy guides us to develop increasingly common back-end systems and shared technology platforms while deploying more consistent processes around focused and accountable teams. Our strategy is working and it is delivering unique present and future value to our customers as well as sustainable value creation to our shareholders. In the quarter, we outperformed expectations at the top and bottom line and we are raising our top and bottom line guidance for the year. Congratulations and thank you to the entire Trimble team. The numbers reflect hard and intentional work in the quarter as well as over the last 4.5 years. Three messages to convey here. First, we delivered ARR of $2.187 billion in the quarter, up 14% organically. This kind of growth at scale doesn't happen without an enormous commitment to our Connect & Scale strategy. We also delivered a record gross margin of 68.5%. That compares to a gross margin of 57.7% in 2019. While the record numbers speak for themselves, it is important to recognize that this is a result of the journey we undertook a number of years ago and we are proud of our progress. Second, the structural improvement in the quality of the Trimble business model reflects focus and choice, choice manifests as disciplined capital allocation. In the last 4 years, we have divested 22 businesses. In September, we announced our intention to sell our mobility business to Platform Science and to become a major shareholder in the combined business. We are playing in the zones where we believe we have the strongest rate to win. As soon as we conclude the audit process with EY, we will return to share buyback as we believe this is a high return on investment use of shareholder capital at our current valuation. As a reminder, we have $625 million remaining under our current authorization. Finally, the sum of our efforts over the last year is manifesting as a more simplified Trimble, managed and led by a highly focused, engaged and hungry team. Moving to Slide 5, we cover the financial highlights from the quarter. 4% revenue growth exceeded our expectations, as did EBITDA at a strong 27.1% and EPS at $0.70 which performed above the high end of our guidance range. To give a quick snapshot of a few of these metrics without the mobility business, ARR would have grown 16% instead of 14% and revenue would have grown 5% instead of 4%. Before moving to comment on segment performance, I'll provide an update on the status of our financial audit procedures. During the August earnings call, I thought we were approximately a month or so away from being done. I was obviously wrong. In September, we held our Annual Shareholder Meeting, reflecting the progress made and the ongoing confidence we continue to have that our financial results will be the same as we previously reported. Since then, EY has continued to perform additional audit procedures. There is only one right answer. We work collaboratively to provide them the information they need. While our team and the EY team are making progress on completing the audit procedures, we now believe that EY will not complete their work in time for us to re-file our financial statements ahead of NASDAQ's November 11 deadline. Procedurally speaking, what will happen first is the formality of a notice from NASDAQ saying we are subject to delisting. We then communicate this via 8-K in a press release. After that, NASDAQ has a structured stay and appeals process for dealing with this exact topic. We feel confident that we are well positioned to be granted an extension which will provide EY additional time to complete their work and for us to file our financials, thereby regaining NASDAQ compliance. Let's now talk about the business, starting on Slide 7 with the AECO segment. Congratulations to the team for delivering another record quarter of ARR at $1.21 billion, higher than all but one of our industry peers. The team grew the business 18% organically which is at the high end of growth of our scaled industry peers. And they are doing this in a profitable manner, achieving over 29% operating income for the segment in the quarter. We look at Rule of 40 as an instructive measure where we sum ARR growth and operating margins. We are operating at a Rule of 47, delivering strong net retention and an attractive lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratio. This provides us degrees of freedom on how we think about investing in the business to continue differentiating as we do with the breadth and depth of our offerings, including Trimble Construction One. Our portfolio is also quite balanced, with each component of AEC and O [ph], now operating above $200 million in ARR. I often describe this segment as the tip of the spear of our Connect & Scale strategy and the strategy is definitively working in AECO. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us, the results of today give me confidence in delivering the results of tomorrow. Let's turn to Slide 8 and talk about the Field Systems business. Revenue was in line with our expectations, down 2%. ARR outperformed, growing 19%, demonstrating the intentional work of the team to move more of our value to the software aspect of our systems to do so in the cloud and to monetize as a subscription offering. ARR growth came from strong sales of our Catalyst solution which delivers Positioning-as-a-Service, our Machine Control-as-a-Service offering and through ongoing growth in our traditional positioning services business. The team did this while delivering 33% operating income margin, demonstrating the ability to control cost in an unforgiving market environment. Strategically speaking, Digital Twins is a popular buzzword these days. In a Trimble context, I'd like to think we were the original digital twin company. The job of a surveying and mapping professional is to create a digital model of the physical earth. Our reach into the physical world, connected to our digital footprint and round trip back to the physical world is what is singularly unique about our company. In the quarter, we released a new solution to enable this workflow. I'm really excited about this launch. It's called Trimble Reality Capture Service. And what it does is link data captured in the field from terrestrial, mobile and aerial modalities, then links it to Trimble Connect which enables cloud-based visualization and collaboration at scale. We think this will prove to be one of those only Trimble innovations and we are excited to see how the market adopts this technology and guides us to develop it further. Another strategic milestone came in the form of the renewal and extension of our 20-plus year joint venture with Caterpillar. Slide 9 provides additional details on the renewal. The most important element to convey is our shared vision to accelerate innovation and customer adoption of mixed fleet machine control solutions and the construction ecosystem technology. For Trimble customers, the goal is simple, broader availability and access to our technology. Our recent partnership announcement with John Deere is evidence that we intend to achieve this goal. Also, our ability to link machine control solutions to Trimble Construction One offerings is another only Trimble proof point. Closing our segment commentary on Slide 10, Transportation & Logistics beat our top and bottom line expectations. Transporeon delivered double-digit ARR growth and MAPS delivered high single-digit ARR growth. Excluding the mobility business, organic ARR growth in the segment was 9%. Operating margins of 21% were the highest we have achieved in many years. While the freight recession persists, the Transporeon team delivered a record level of third quarter bookings which was also the second largest in the history of the business. In a dynamic macro environment, the team has done a great job with solid execution and an advantaged business translating into profitable growth and consistent share gains. Strategically speaking, the big news of the quarter was our announcement that we signed a deal to sell our mobility business to Platform Science and that we intend to become a major shareholder in the business. Further details are covered on Slide 11. For the combined business, this will create a scaled and focused software business that has a unique combined breadth of solutions needed to compete in the current environment. For Trimble, we will maintain a commercial relationship with the ongoing business. And at a company level, this enables us to further simplify and focus our attention and efforts in the areas where we have the most compelling right to win. Before handing over to Phil, in the last call, I talked about how I see Trimble as an AI winner. In the quarter, we continued to progress our AI efforts, both internally and externally facing. In this call, I'll end with a perspective on the macro environment. Geographically, the bookings we see are North America as the strongest market in Asia Pacific, excluding India, as the weakest market at the moment. By end markets, construction and transportation overall represent our book ends. Construction subsegments such as renewables, mega projects and infrastructure remain relatively strong. Residential remains challenged as do transportation end markets. In all environments, we anchor to our unique value proposition. What we sell enables work to be done better, faster, safer, cheaper and greener. The business is there, we need to be showing up in the right market segments with the right solutions and the right go-to-market motions. Phil, over to you.\nPhil Sawarynski: Thank you, Rob. As noted before, my financial commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis which excludes our agriculture business but will still include the mobility business. We believe that maximizing long-term free cash flow drives shareholder value. Connect & Scale is our strategy which we believe will continue to deliver recurring revenue growth, margin expansion and ultimately, cumulative cash flow growth. Slide 12 highlights balance sheet and cash flow dynamics. Our cash flow continues to trend better than expected after considering M&A transaction impacts. 2024 year-to-date reported free cash flow was $389 million. That includes $87 million of tax payments related to our gain on sale of the agriculture business as well as $66 million in M&A-related transaction expenses. Our conversion ratio through the first 3 quarters of 2024 without these items was well above our target of 1x non-GAAP net income. We have additional tax payments impacting future operating cash flow related to the agriculture JV gain on sale in our fourth quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2025 since the tax payments are spread out over time. Our asset-light model continues with capital expenditures about 1% of revenue and negative net working capital. Net debt to EBITDA stands at less than 1x, well below our long-term leverage target of 2.5x. We have just over $1 billion in cash after paying down our term debt and the outstanding balances on our credit facilities. Our capital allocation focus remains the same where we invest and where we see opportunities for the highest returns. We continue to disproportionately allocate capital to our AECO business, where a significant percent of our operating expense increases are in our sales and marketing engines to continue to drive ARR and revenue growth and ultimately margin expansion and free cash flow generation. On the merger and acquisition front, we expect to opportunistically pursue tuck-in acquisitions primarily in the AECO segment where we can quickly integrate and bundle within Trimble Construction One. Our 2 recent acquisitions in AECO continue to demonstrate that our M&A playbook is working. The human resources application we purchased about a year ago was quickly integrated into our Viewpoint ERP and we have already over tripled the ARR and almost quadrupled the customer accounts for the product in that first year. The payments application we purchased in the second quarter is ahead of our initial integration plans into the Viewpoint ERPs and we are seeing bookings well in excess of our deal models. These growth opportunities are enabled by our Connect & Scale strategy via bundled product offerings that we put in the hands of our sellers. This playbook is a critical part of our acquisition strategy going forward. With that, let's turn to Slide 13 and talk about guidance for the remainder of the year. We have a 53rd week in fiscal 2024 which adds approximately $85 million of revenue and $50 million of operating income, mainly driven by term license renewals on January 1 which falls in the fourth quarter of this year. We are holding our ARR growth at 11% to 13% but are biased towards the higher end of the range with the AECO performance offset by the churn in our mobility business that we previously discussed. We are increasing the midpoint of our as-reported full year revenue guidance by $15 million from $3.63 billion to $3.645 billion. AECO revenue is slightly better than our prior guide due to the performance in the first 3 quarters. Field Systems revenue is also slightly up and transportation is unchanged. Correspondingly, the full year earnings per share midpoint is increasing by $0.09 to $2.83 from the prior $2.74. Our as-adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to be between 27.5% and 27.8% which is approximately an 80-basis-point improvement at the midpoint from our prior guide. Free cash flow conversion for the year is approximately 0.75x non-GAAP net income which includes $116 million of taxes from the gain on sale from the agriculture JV and as well as approximately $85 million in full year M&A costs. Without these items, we'd be above the 1x non-GAAP net income for the year and an improvement from the prior guide. Let's move to our fourth quarter on Slide 14 which is consistent with our prior guide. I will focus again on our as-adjusted view which excludes agriculture. Our outlook for ARR growth remained strong with continued expectations for 11% to 13% organic growth with a bias to the higher end. Our total company revenue is projected to be $925 million to $965 million which includes approximately $85 million due to the 53rd week. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding the 53rd week, our revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 1% to 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 30% and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 30% to 31.5% for the fourth quarter. Our EPS forecast is in the range of $0.83 to $0.91. One more item I'd like to mention before turning it back over to Rob. As we think about the financial model going into 2025, it is critical to make the correct pro forma adjustments for the ag and mobility divestitures, along with the 53rd week. I'll point you to the earnings supplement on our Investor site where we consolidated the adjustments in one place. For 2025, we expect continued double-digit organic ARR growth. Starting from a baseline of pro forma 2024 revenue, we continue to believe that with the shift to higher-growth software, we are biased above the midpoint of the last Investor Day range of 5% to 8% organic revenue growth. We expect AECO to be above this range. Transportation is expected to be in this range after the divestiture of mobility which we are now expecting to close in the first quarter of 2025. We're expecting Field Systems to return to growth but be below this range. Rob, I'll turn it back over to you.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Phil and thanks to all our Trimble colleagues and partners for delivering a solid quarter and a 2024 year-to-date of strategic and financial [indiscernible]. In the third quarter, we held our Signature User Conference in Las Vegas for a North American transportation business and our Signature User Conference for Transporeon in Vienna. We were able to see over 2,000 customers and partners with these 2 events. The overall feedback was positive on the mobility divestiture as well as the direction of travel of how Connect & Scale translates to digitize and connect the transportation supply chain. In less than 1 week, we will be back in Las Vegas at our Trimble Dimensions Engineering and Construction User Conference, where we will host over 6,000 attendees who are coming to learn how to further digitize and transform their work. In closing, we look forward to seeing many of you on December 10 in New York City at our Investor Day, where we will unpack our business and show you why we are so excited about our ability to win across our business lines with the right combination of products, people and go-to-market strategies. It's a busy and exciting time to be at Trimble. Operator, let's open the line to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer.\nKristen Owen: Congratulations on the nice results. I'm wondering, Rob, if we could start with just a little bit more color on the ACV bookings. What you're seeing in terms of cross-sell and upsell opportunities within the TC1 portfolio? And then I'll have a follow-up.\nRob Painter: Thanks for the question. ACV bookings across actually the entirety of the company were strong in the quarter. So we feel really good about that. That supports obviously, the ARR growth that we've already had and as well as the ARR guide that Phil took you through. Inside those ACV bookings, if we're looking inside the AECO business, TC1 was another highly successful quarter for that commercial offering and where we're doing the pre-packaged bundles. We see that the strong majority of our bookings, where we have TC1 available within AECO which is primarily within the engineering and construction applications, the strong majority are now TC1 bookings and those bookings are up more than the company average. And so within that, you have cross-sell and upsell happening. Similarly, in Transportation & Logistics segment, if we look at Transporeon on year-to-date, ACV bookings are up over 30% on a year-over-year basis. So a really nice progression from the teams in the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Rob, thank you for sharing the preliminary comments on '25, broadly in line with consensus top line expectations. What's interesting is given the trajectory you're on for ARR growth and what you just said about bookings, it feels like to get to the high end of your organic growth range, you would have to have hardware top line that's down high single digits. And so I'm wondering, can we just flush [ph] that out? Is that about what you're assuming? And is the idea, hey, look, there's uncertainty out there, let's make sure when we provide the initial '25 outlook comments, we have enough leeway in case end markets are softer? Or are there any discrete points that we should keep in mind relative to the outlook considering how strong momentum you have in ARR and bookings?\nPhil Sawarynski: Jerry, it's Phil. Let me take that and then Rob can add if he needs to. It's a great question. I appreciate it. As we think about 2025, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, AECO above that range. Transportation in that range and remember, that's ex mobility. And then Field Systems being below that range. Now we still believe Field Systems will return to growth but it will be sort of low single-digit growth to get there. And a couple of the elements around Field Systems. So one is, we talked about the Fed this year. We believe the Fed business still will be down next year which provides a little bit of a headwind. The other piece of that, as we think about the CAT JV evolution, we are going to be part of the economics of that. We believe there are going to be some shift of the revenue to the factory fit. And so as we think about that long term, with the channel evolution that we talked about and going after the mixed fleets, call it, past 2025, we believe that, that will offset and more than offset any of the impacts on the factory fit. But for 2025, that revenue, there's a couple of points of headwind because of that. And then if I actually talk about the profit related to that, one of the other elements of the JV is we changed how we're pricing -- Trimble is pricing some of the products into the JV. And so what happens is, even though there's a couple of points of headwind on the revenue, there's additional profit that shifts from the JV to Trimble. And then if you net-net all of those puts and takes down to the EBITDA level, we believe that it's neutral for the rest of '24 and it's neutral for '25 on a profit standpoint. So that's a little bit more color, I guess, on the Field Systems. But we do see Field Systems growing, let's call it, low single digits next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer.\nKristen Owen: Phil, just it does relate to the Caterpillar relationship and the Deere construction partnership announced in the quarter. Can you just help us understand with respect to the Deere partnership, what's covered under the scope of the agreement? How are you guys planning to go to market together? And I'd like to understand how you think about this partnership in the context of that long-standing relationship with Caterpillar? Any channel risk that you see with the Deere partnership there?\nRob Painter: Kristen, it's Rob. I'll take the question and thanks for the follow-up. I'll start with the lens of the customer on this. And both the Deere agreement and the CAT agreement help us grow the adoption of technology in the industry. And so what that means for a customer is that they're getting their choice of machine and technology and support to best fit their business. And that's both with John Deere and Caterpillar. And if you take John Deere specifically, what we're doing at the product level is enabling 3D upgrades on top of their platform, machine platform. At a go-to-market level, those upgrades can be enabled either through the John Deere dealer or through the Trimble network. At a competitive level or at a, let's call it, a channel -- potential channel complex level, I would characterize it as a no. We see it as complementary. And that's because we're not adequately serving that demand or that opportunity today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: My question, Rob, is maybe you could just give us a big picture take on where Transportation & Logistics stands with the subtraction of mobility? Does it change the Connect & Scale? Does it change what you're offering to customers? And then your Transporeon results continue to improve and be very impressive. I wonder if you can talk about anything you're doing aside from seeing a rebound to strategically grow that business?\nRob Painter: Thanks for the question, Rob. At a Connect & Scale level within Transportation & Logistics feel as good as ever about the opportunity and the evolution of the business and the business model and the opportunity. I mean, clearly, at a financial level to improve the metrics with a divestiture, I should say, mobility will improve the metrics, the growth and the profitability metrics and allow more, I call it, the goodness of the underlying portfolio to be seen. And I feel very good about the transaction that we're doing with Platform Science. I think together, this will be a scaled business that is well positioned to compete in today's marketplace. And we will have an ongoing commercial relationship. And to me, that's very important is that within that ongoing commercial relationship, call it, 2-way relationship, that ability to move data and to plug into our platform and our ecosystem, we think, can provide customers an ongoing differential level of outcomes. So good strategically, good at a capital allocation level, good at a focus level, helping us put more of our chips in the areas where we think we're best positioned to compete and where we have a right to win. From the Transporeon business specifically, both I'll call it at a product level or maybe call it strategic level across the whole portfolio, the teams have done a nice job bringing together some capabilities across both -- all of the businesses, both in the visibility side of things as well as in the freight marketplace. So like the moves the team are making to bring the businesses together, this is what we envisioned when we did the deal. And then in terms of the ongoing improvement in Transporeon I mean, hey, in the control that you can control aspect of things, bookings, to me, is the number one thing on my mind. Can't control the underlying freight market, especially in Europe which continues to be difficult. But we can control where we show up to compete. We are getting more than our fair share of wins with customers. These are some of the biggest logos in the world that we continue to win. I think the team is doing a really nice job. Those bookings wins up today, the nature of how bookings work in Transporeon as they do take a decent amount of time to actually come to full fruition. They ramp up, so they don't just flip the switch immediately because this is a consumption-based model in the form of primarily, I should say, 2/3 of the business models in the form of transactions on the marketplace. To see the real, say, improvement in the near term is in 2025, we need to see an improvement in the freight market to drive more transactions on the platform. A little bit cautious in Europe for 2025. So I would see that more as modest growth -- ongoing modest growth for Transporeon into 2025. And I think everything we've been doing this year and I think the team will continue to do in the fourth quarter into next year, will position that business to grow even faster coming out of next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Yes. I wanted to ask, Rob, the really interesting stats that you and Phil shared on the improved performance on the business you acquired within TC1 or the 2 businesses you acquired, can you just talk about your M&A pipeline as it stands today? What's the range of potential outcomes of how much capital we can deploy similar acquisitions that fit over the next 12 to 18 months based on what you see? And if you can touch on the valuation parameters on these last 2 deals, if you don't mind?\nRob Painter: Jerry, it's Rob. I'll start and Phil can fill in. Hey, at the M&A level, we do have a pipeline. Our priority is with the software acquisitions. Within software, we're primarily looking -- where we're looking first within the AECO segment which I think would not be a surprise. We think where we have opportunities to do tuck-in is that we can create high return on investment outcomes and that's clearly important from a capital allocation perspective at what we call dry powder perspective, we're sitting at Phil walk through about 0.8x net debt to EBITDA, we've got a target to be below 2.5x [ph]. So there's, call it, call it $1.5 billion firepower should we -- say, should we need it but I don't anticipate putting that kind of capital to work. We are thinking a lot as well about the buyback as a big commitment we made and we stand behind that commitment on the buyback, especially with where we see the stock price today. So that's a balance we have, Jerry, is on the buyback and the M&A. Expect more of the tuck-in type moves, I would say, at a divestiture level and we do not expect any additional major moves to happen on that front. Hopefully, that helps answer your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJason Celino: Just 2 for me. Field Systems, really nice beat. Maybe can you just unpack the strength there? Was it more on the public sector side? Or did you see any deals closed earlier than you had initially planned?\nRob Painter: Jason, it's Rob. Did you mean Field Systems or the AECO?\nJason Celino: Field Systems.\nRob Painter: Okay. So within Field Systems, actually, at the revenue level, we ended where we anticipated to be in the quarter in Field Systems. What we see that's driving the business, there's the new product we've got a set of new products that are coming out actually at dimensions. Next week, we'll be making a number of new announcements, both on the software and the hardware side of the business. So we continue to bring new products in geospatial or the survey market forward like the R980 that's improving the communications and the range on that. In the machine control market, it hits the civil construction. Our BX992 offering helps us reach a mid-tier market. And our correction services or with compositioning services business, a technology called IonoGuard is correcting for errors in the ionosphere. This is through the solar cycle that's been ongoing and that's helping to ensure the accuracy of those signals and those corrections that we provide our customers around the world. So, new product introduction is helping to drive the revenue. I'm especially pleased with the growth of the ARR in the segment in the quarter and that's coming from the machine control service as -- excuse me, offering-as-a-service. It's in our positioning services business where we continue to win new OEMs in the automotive market. And we literally sell positioning as a service with a product called Trimble Catalyst and are looking to do more bundling with the term licenses and the correction services that we have. So it's a good number of activities happening. The team is executing well in addition, at the go-to-market with our channel partners around the world. So, really a nice intersection with the product and the go-to-market and the business and then the team doing a nice job working the business models.\nJason Celino: Okay, great. Yes, I know the Field Systems there been accelerating nicely on organic level, so that explains it. Maybe just keeping on kind of the organic ARR theme. This is the second quarter in a row; we've seen 14% growth at a corporate level. I think you're still guiding to 11% to 13% organic for the full year. Maybe kind of maybe just walk us through the implied deceleration there, any conservatism you have?\nPhil Sawarynski: Thanks, Jason. This is Phil. Yes, so if you remember, I mentioned this, we have the mobility headwind with a lot of the known churn that's going to happen at the end of this year. So my 2 comments were, one, I said 11% to 13% but biased toward the high end. We still see the continued strength in the AECO business. But where we're seeing some of the offset is that known churn around mobility in Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan.\nTami Zakaria: My first question is what's the conversation like among your customers post the Fed rate cuts? Do you feel a sense of optimism, could customer activity improve as we look to next year, meaning, could there be an acceleration in trends at some point next year? Any anecdotes you can share from last week cut cycles, whether you saw any acceleration maybe at a lag or anything to call out there? Or is rate cuts historically a factor for you at all. So just curious how you think about this transition.\nRob Painter: It's Rob and thanks for the question. Well, I have to say, we've depends on your time line of Fed rate cuts because we've been coming out of, I guess, a ZIRP environment, we've seen more Fed rate increases over the last few years and you've got to get the long baseline to go to go back to see an environment to anything like what we've been in that is to say, an inflationary environment that comes down. So it's hard to look back really in time and have anything that would, I think, be especially helpful. I would point out that what is so different about our business today compared to Trimble of the past is more than 75% software and more than 60% recurring. So we have a fundamentally different portfolio at such a higher degree of visibility into our business than we've ever had in the past. At the -- from what we hear and I would call it anecdotally is increased level of confidence and the confidence that turns into certainty, certainty can turn into ability to make the capital commitments. So I'd call that anecdotal. Of course, more than half of our business is outside the U.S., more than half of our hardware business is outside the U.S. And so we not only pay attention to the interest rate environment in the U.S. but globally as well. So, I think it's a little bit early to tell to say anything definitive other than to say anecdotally, we hear more confidence. And what if I think -- so one thing I am looking out for is -- and this is a North American example is, if you look at the bipartisan infrastructure law and you look at the amount of the money that's been deployed, only about 25%, plus or minus, of the funds have been deployed to date. So I call it good news in terms of the ongoing funding availability for the bipartisan infrastructure. And then, if you look at the cost of and let's take a U.S. example, every mile of road is about $1 million. And if you look then within each of the -- within that mile of road build, over $900,000 of that approximately is the raw materials, including the subsurface materials as well as the asphalt. The minority ends up being the machinery and the labor. And to the extent that inflation comes down on the materials, that's a good thing that if we can build more road with that. So that's half inflation coming down but I think that correlates to the interest rates coming down. So that's the kind of thing that we're paying attention to or the derivative -- second, third order derivative impacts.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. That is very helpful. And second question, I'm actually looking forward to your Analyst Day but any early thoughts on how you're thinking about your long-term incremental margin target now that you have divested some of the hardware-centric low-margin businesses?\nPhil Sawarynski: Tami, it's Phil. I can take that one. Yes. So obviously, we'll get into more detail at Investor Day but last earnings call -- I'll sort of reiterate what I said last earnings call which was we're biased -- as we think about the long-term model, we're biased above the midpoint of our prior Investor Day model which was 5% to 8%. So that sort of gives you the revenue number. As we continue to grow the software business disproportionate to the hardware business, you would expect the gross margin expansion. And then we talked about the operating leverage last time it being 30%, 35%. So we're biased towards the high end of that. And then if you put that all together with some expansion at the EBITDA level, we said over the time, we could expect probably 100 basis points of margin expansion. Again, that's over a multiyear view. But we can get into more details on the Investor Day as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Clarke Jeffries with Piper Sandler.\nClarke Jeffries: It's been pretty encouraging to see as adjusted margin expansion during this year expand from a range of 100 to 200 basis points now to 200 to 250. I wanted to specifically ask about the margin expansion we've seen this year in transportation. I was wondering how durable do you see that multi-hundred basis point margin expansion in Transportation & Logistics. I understand that with mobility, there will be a tailwind to margins next year but even kind of as adjusted, what -- how are you thinking about the underlying efficiency gains you can get in the transportation segment? And what kind of op income expansion could we expect on a go-forward basis?\nPhil Sawarynski: Yes. So Clarke, this is Phil. Let me start and Rob can add any color. So as we think about -- as you said, as we got rid of or as we divested the mobility business going into 2025, that's been obviously a drag on our growth and our ARR growth this year. So we mentioned that before. So then when you have what's left is you've got the MAPS business which is performing well, continues to grow. I think we grew sort of high single digits ARR growth in Q3. Rob had already talked about the Transporeon business. And we're not forecasting right now for 2025 any meaningful change in the overall market. But he mentioned the bookings growth. And it's been a healthy business on our growth. It's been double digit, call it, revenue growth and accretive on the OI. So when you think about those businesses continuing to perform at that level, I would expect additional growth and margin expansion from those businesses as we go forward.\nClarke Jeffries: Perfect. And just one follow-up. Rob, you kind of given this interesting disclosure about how much ARR is split between the A, the E, the C and the O. When we think about the ability to sustain it seems like multiple years of 18% to 20% organic ARR growth, has the composition of that organic ARR growth has been fairly balanced over the years and you give these comments around 30% ACV growth in the E&C segment kind of driven by TC1 but are those segments kind of equally contributing over the years and that's kind of part of the confidence in AECO growth above the midpoint of the kind of organic growth range next year?\nRob Painter: It's a good question. I would say more -- there is a -- how do I say this; there's a variety of growth outcomes that we have within the A, the E, the C and the O. I wanted to point out that they're each above $200 million to point out the balance we have in it. So we don't have a dependent -- an overdependency on one aspect of the portfolio. And I think that's important message to get across and that was the intent of that. With the growth rates specifically, actually, our architecture and design business, kudos and shout out to the team for the last 3 to 4 years, let's say, well outgrown at an ARR growth level the rest of the of the portfolio. And we think it's probably the largest addressable market opportunity we have with the SketchUp product. We crossed the threshold last quarter of over 1 million paid subscribers using the technology. It's the one that's got the largest customer reach in the world for Trimble. So that aspect of -- or that part of the business is growing the fastest. I think it will probably still continue to grow the fastest for the next couple of years. I'd say the growth within the E and the C parts of AECO are pretty similar and I don't see that changing over time over the next couple of years, excuse me. And then the O, that -- sort of we call that the owner in the public sector. The public sector does grow at a lower rate than the private sector. We think one of the things that I think though tends to be quite attractive within the public sector is net retention tends to be high which is to say churn very low. So, gross retention tends to be the highest in that side of the business; so well balanced. Growth rates are differential but not enough, I think, to change our view here in the next couple of years of the growth opportunity for the business where we would see ARR continuing to grow in the teens.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein.\nChad Dillard: So I wanted to go back to your early thoughts for '25. Just trying to understand like what sort of macro environment is embedded in that outlook? I guess more specifically, just thoughts on how you're thinking about construction and how it layers into your Field Systems guidance? And then secondly, I mean, it sounds like the AECO business is growing faster, the mobility side or the transportation side. And so like what does that mean for incremental margins or the gross margins in the '25 as well?\nRob Painter: Let me start with the macro and Phil can fill in some of the margin dynamics. And at a macro level, I wouldn't expect really any meaningful change from what we know now. I mean, after all, January 1 will just be the day after December 31. So it's hard for me to say that I see big, meaningful changes in the market. We've seen the North American economy stronger than the European economy. I would expect that to continue. We've seen subsegments such as data centers, renewable energy, onshoring of manufacturing to be strong and stronger than residential. If interest rates continue to come down, I think that could be a positive inflection to the residential end market. So we're paying attention to that because we know that that's underbuilt and that will come back over time. In the Field Systems side, we certainly look at what the OEMs are saying and they're projecting units down in construction and agriculture and that's incorporated into our thoughts on Field Systems. Now we still expect it to grow next year but to be below the company average on growth. And so that's taken into -- we're trying to take that into account. And transportation and the macros, I think that 2025 could start to look better for the macros in North America. There do appear to be some green shoots coming to get supply and demand and to better balance. In Europe, I would expect more of the same as a default thinking. So we're not expecting to see an inflection in -- meaningful inflection in the number of transactions per customer that would impact -- that would positively impact the Transporeon business were to be wrong in that and the economy were to be better. So some of those macro thoughts make it into the revenue, I don't know if we call it guidance yet but I'll call it revenue early revenue thoughts that Phil put forward. Phil, do you want to fill in the rest?\nPhil Sawarynski: Yes. Thanks, Chad. So I'd say, again, we weren't -- this wasn't intended to be a guide -- a full guide for next year is just to give you a preview of how we're thinking about the year on a revenue basis. But I think you could roughly apply the construct that I talked about earlier around the growth and the gross margin expansion, the op leverage. And you can use the revenue growth rates that I alluded to which is AECO being the top transportation being in the range and Field Systems being lower and I think you can get to a rough model there. But certainly at Investor Day and as we go forward, we can give you more detailed view on that for 2025.\nRob Painter: And I also would -- this is Rob again. I point out that we have the earnings supplement. I'd encourage everyone to make sure you're looking through that because there are moving parts that we need to make sure that you're taking into account moving parts. One will be the mobility divestiture, assuming it happens which we assume in Q1. We've got the -- we'll have the agriculture that will lap in Q1, so thus, the as adjusted. And then the third big one is the 53rd week that we've got here in 2024. And so it's just -- it's really important to understand these pieces and work from the right baseline. Otherwise, it can look -- it will look off, especially with the 53rd week and the divestitures. And so we're thinking about it very much on an organic basis, excluding that 53rd week when we make this commentary.\nChad Dillard: Okay, that's super helpful. And then second question, I just want to get a better sense on the road map for rolling out the rest of TC1 from like, I guess, onto the owner side of the house and then also from a geographic standpoint. Where are you on that? When do you expect to see those -- that strategy kind of fully played out? And then how do you think about the incremental addressable market that you're able to reach from that?\nRob Painter: Chad, great question. Okay. So within AECO, the primary place where we're selling it today is with the E and the C part of the portfolio, where we sell to the engineering and construction customers, by the way, that could be mechanical, electrical, plumbing, steel, concrete contractors, the general contractors who do both vertical and horizontal work. Those are the primary customer set where we're selling it today. Anywhere where those customers can use architecture and design product, SketchUp we are selling it into those bundles. For our pure architects and only architects and only designers, they're not really buying TC1. They're buying -- they're just buying the product that they need Okay. So within the engineering and construction part of the AECO primarily, as you know, it's been already out in North America. TC1 is a framework commercial offering. We've got over 20 pre-packaged subofferings within that to target the personas. Then we're, I'd say, early in the European rollout and really not in Asia Pacific in a meaningful way, especially Southeast Asia, not in any meaningful way. I would anticipate next year that we really see Europe rolled out and I would say, probably partially so in Asia Pacific. We've got to have some of the underlying systems work done to help enable that which rolls out geographically. Then you asked about the O and bringing that owner in public sector into that and we'll start to see more of that next year. Now the owner and public sector actually already has its own form of TC1. We call it Trimble Unity where we brought together multiple capabilities we have around enterprise asset management and digital project delivery. And so that has come together in the form of a suite of technology to serve asset life cycle management which we think is actually super unique. So what we'll do is continue to pursue asset life cycle management within the owner and public sector, have the linkages to TC1. The extent of whether it is or isn't called TC1, I'm a bit indifferent, I'm more focused on we're delivering the outcomes to the customers. The other thing I'd want to take a chance to point out is, next year, you'll see, we'll see more linkages to the machine control and guidance market where we have an as-a-service offering, linking that into the TC1 bundles for civil contractors. And if you take a capability like we have with B2W, I think, estimating and tracking field progress for civil contractors, that makes a lot of sense to link to the construction ERP that civil contractors buy from us, to link that to the machine control and guidance that they can buy from us, to link that to the project management the in-product controls that they buy from us, not only to link the technology, to link the workflow. And these are the things that we can uniquely do at that intersection of the physical and the digital. So, I look forward to seeing more rollouts next year. When you ask about the addressable market, what we have seen consistently through the rollouts of the bundles that we are expanding the size of the addressable markets. We're expanding the reach we have in the customers as we move into more of an as-a-service offering.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Tilton with Wolfe Research.\nArsenije Matovic: This is Arsenije Matovic on for Josh Tilton from Wolfe Research. Just first question, really great results in transportation and AECO, I guess, within transportation, record bookings and from Transporeon on despite the European freight rates. Can you maybe go into what's driving that? Is it better consumption than expected, better new logo wins with larger customers being added? And then moving on to AECO, within AECO TC1 specifically, what's going on there as well from a high level? Are there better expansions from existing customers? Are there new logo wins with improving win rates? Anything you can share there? And then, I just had a brief follow-up.\nRob Painter: This is Rob. I'll start within Transporeon. The bookings were the record bookings both for the both for the quarter. It was a record third quarter level of bookings. It was the second highest quarter ever bookings, put it more longitudinally to the year and about 30% increase year-to-date on a year-over-year basis. Those bookings are primarily coming from new logos and then increasing -- there's a land and expand play we have within the portfolio because there's a broad set of capabilities that the platform can deliver. And so that cross-sell of the rest of the capabilities is also driving a level of bookings. I'd say, in that business, I'm most pleased with the level of the new bookings and we were able to meet good number of existing as well as new logo customers at our User Conference just a few weeks ago in Vienna. And the customers are looking for -- both by the way the carriers and the shippers are looking for efficiencies that the platform can unlock. They're looking -- and we're seeing nice growth within the autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation product lines within the business. This is AI at work generating revenue and actually being monetized which I am really pleased to see. So we've got a differential set of products and capabilities and outcomes that we can deliver to the customers. We're primarily selling to the shippers. We bring them into the network and then they fulfill and execute through the carriers that are in the network. At the TC1 level, let me make sure I understood your question. Are you looking for color on what's driving that growth or what else we're doing within...\nArsenije Matovic: Exactly. Is the expansion? Is it new logo driven? Is there anything with better competitive wins with a more cautious budget environment for some competitors that are offering more expensive solutions, anything to get into there?\nRob Painter: Yes. So yes, let's start with the bookings. The bookings were right at or probably actually slightly above the level of the ARR growth in the quarter. That informs the view forward that Phil talked about in his prepared remarks. We have an enormous ability to cross-sell and upsell within the existing customer base that we have. And so that's where we do see the majority of the growth that we have in the business. And we are winning new logos. We have a differential offering. And the more we can link the bundles and the workflows together, we're seeing that generate new logo wins for us. The team has done just a really, I think, a terrific job throughout the year, actually throughout the last few years but let's just say, throughout the year to date, both at a product level, at go-to-market level and the underlying systems level. So at a product level, I think delivering -- defining and delivering the TC1 bundles, linking the workflow, establishing a marketplace where we can do integrations and have a sets of APIs to be able to integrate the technology that we have, defining the bundles. We're seeing good success when we have like ERP and project management, when we link ERP and estimating when, we link design and estimating. So we're following what the customers and the market are telling us to define the product set to take to market. At a go-to-market level, earlier in the year, we moved to a named account selling model and it's working. And then at a systems and process level, sales enablement, sales operations, getting 360-degree views of our customers, underlying marketing transformation to drive the pipeline. The pieces are coming together nicely in the business. And then linking that to one of the earlier questions, this is -- gives us the ability to take this across the rest of the world from what we've already been doing in North America and part of Europe fully into Europe and then into Asia Pacific.\nArsenije Matovic: Got it. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up. Is there any way you can provide more color on what changed from the last earnings call when you provided the expectation of completing the audit review in September? And is there anything, I guess, that you could share that would help investors better understand that timing change? Is there any new target, like could we expect maybe this to be completed before the Investor Day? Or just anything that you could provide additional color on there.\nPhil Sawarynski: This is Phil. Let me start. So look, this is the number one priority for us. We're trying to work through this. E&Y has been performing incremental audit procedures. They're really focused on completing this but in a very thorough and detailed manner. And so I think back when we thought it was a few weeks away, we underestimated sort of just the breadth and depth of the audit as it went forward. So I think that was on us. But they're doing their work. The team is -- the Trimble team is very focused on this. We've put in outside resources throughout this process. But what I will reiterate is Rob's comment that throughout these many months, we pulled many, many data samples and we still have not seen anything that would indicate a restatement of any of our financial statements that to date, the financial statements that we filed, we believe are correct. So we're continuing to work hard with them. Again, we're trying to get this completed as soon as possible. But unfortunately, it's just one of those we, as Trimble can't control the time line. And so all we can do is put our heads down and work really hard and be very responsive to the UI requests and try to get this behind us as soon as we can.\nRob Painter: And I would think the answer is yes, we would anticipate having it done before Investor Day.\nArsenije Matovic: Got it. Thank you very much. Congrats on the results.\nRob Painter: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the Safe Harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons which refer to the corresponding period of the prior year, unless otherwise noted. In addition, our P&L commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis which excludes our agriculture business. Let's start on Slide 4. During the third quarter, we continued to advance our Connect & Scale strategy. The Connect aspect of the strategy guides us to digitally connect users, data and workflows across stakeholders in the engineering and construction and transportation and logistics industries. The Scale aspect of the strategy guides us to develop increasingly common back-end systems and shared technology platforms while deploying more consistent processes around focused and accountable teams. Our strategy is working and it is delivering unique present and future value to our customers as well as sustainable value creation to our shareholders. In the quarter, we outperformed expectations at the top and bottom line and we are raising our top and bottom line guidance for the year. Congratulations and thank you to the entire Trimble team. The numbers reflect hard and intentional work in the quarter as well as over the last 4.5 years. Three messages to convey here. First, we delivered ARR of $2.187 billion in the quarter, up 14% organically. This kind of growth at scale doesn't happen without an enormous commitment to our Connect & Scale strategy. We also delivered a record gross margin of 68.5%. That compares to a gross margin of 57.7% in 2019. While the record numbers speak for themselves, it is important to recognize that this is a result of the journey we undertook a number of years ago and we are proud of our progress. Second, the structural improvement in the quality of the Trimble business model reflects focus and choice, choice manifests as disciplined capital allocation. In the last 4 years, we have divested 22 businesses. In September, we announced our intention to sell our mobility business to Platform Science and to become a major shareholder in the combined business. We are playing in the zones where we believe we have the strongest rate to win. As soon as we conclude the audit process with EY, we will return to share buyback as we believe this is a high return on investment use of shareholder capital at our current valuation. As a reminder, we have $625 million remaining under our current authorization. Finally, the sum of our efforts over the last year is manifesting as a more simplified Trimble, managed and led by a highly focused, engaged and hungry team. Moving to Slide 5, we cover the financial highlights from the quarter. 4% revenue growth exceeded our expectations, as did EBITDA at a strong 27.1% and EPS at $0.70 which performed above the high end of our guidance range. To give a quick snapshot of a few of these metrics without the mobility business, ARR would have grown 16% instead of 14% and revenue would have grown 5% instead of 4%. Before moving to comment on segment performance, I'll provide an update on the status of our financial audit procedures. During the August earnings call, I thought we were approximately a month or so away from being done. I was obviously wrong. In September, we held our Annual Shareholder Meeting, reflecting the progress made and the ongoing confidence we continue to have that our financial results will be the same as we previously reported. Since then, EY has continued to perform additional audit procedures. There is only one right answer. We work collaboratively to provide them the information they need. While our team and the EY team are making progress on completing the audit procedures, we now believe that EY will not complete their work in time for us to re-file our financial statements ahead of NASDAQ's November 11 deadline. Procedurally speaking, what will happen first is the formality of a notice from NASDAQ saying we are subject to delisting. We then communicate this via 8-K in a press release. After that, NASDAQ has a structured stay and appeals process for dealing with this exact topic. We feel confident that we are well positioned to be granted an extension which will provide EY additional time to complete their work and for us to file our financials, thereby regaining NASDAQ compliance. Let's now talk about the business, starting on Slide 7 with the AECO segment. Congratulations to the team for delivering another record quarter of ARR at $1.21 billion, higher than all but one of our industry peers. The team grew the business 18% organically which is at the high end of growth of our scaled industry peers. And they are doing this in a profitable manner, achieving over 29% operating income for the segment in the quarter. We look at Rule of 40 as an instructive measure where we sum ARR growth and operating margins. We are operating at a Rule of 47, delivering strong net retention and an attractive lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratio. This provides us degrees of freedom on how we think about investing in the business to continue differentiating as we do with the breadth and depth of our offerings, including Trimble Construction One. Our portfolio is also quite balanced, with each component of AEC and O [ph], now operating above $200 million in ARR. I often describe this segment as the tip of the spear of our Connect & Scale strategy and the strategy is definitively working in AECO. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us, the results of today give me confidence in delivering the results of tomorrow. Let's turn to Slide 8 and talk about the Field Systems business. Revenue was in line with our expectations, down 2%. ARR outperformed, growing 19%, demonstrating the intentional work of the team to move more of our value to the software aspect of our systems to do so in the cloud and to monetize as a subscription offering. ARR growth came from strong sales of our Catalyst solution which delivers Positioning-as-a-Service, our Machine Control-as-a-Service offering and through ongoing growth in our traditional positioning services business. The team did this while delivering 33% operating income margin, demonstrating the ability to control cost in an unforgiving market environment. Strategically speaking, Digital Twins is a popular buzzword these days. In a Trimble context, I'd like to think we were the original digital twin company. The job of a surveying and mapping professional is to create a digital model of the physical earth. Our reach into the physical world, connected to our digital footprint and round trip back to the physical world is what is singularly unique about our company. In the quarter, we released a new solution to enable this workflow. I'm really excited about this launch. It's called Trimble Reality Capture Service. And what it does is link data captured in the field from terrestrial, mobile and aerial modalities, then links it to Trimble Connect which enables cloud-based visualization and collaboration at scale. We think this will prove to be one of those only Trimble innovations and we are excited to see how the market adopts this technology and guides us to develop it further. Another strategic milestone came in the form of the renewal and extension of our 20-plus year joint venture with Caterpillar. Slide 9 provides additional details on the renewal. The most important element to convey is our shared vision to accelerate innovation and customer adoption of mixed fleet machine control solutions and the construction ecosystem technology. For Trimble customers, the goal is simple, broader availability and access to our technology. Our recent partnership announcement with John Deere is evidence that we intend to achieve this goal. Also, our ability to link machine control solutions to Trimble Construction One offerings is another only Trimble proof point. Closing our segment commentary on Slide 10, Transportation & Logistics beat our top and bottom line expectations. Transporeon delivered double-digit ARR growth and MAPS delivered high single-digit ARR growth. Excluding the mobility business, organic ARR growth in the segment was 9%. Operating margins of 21% were the highest we have achieved in many years. While the freight recession persists, the Transporeon team delivered a record level of third quarter bookings which was also the second largest in the history of the business. In a dynamic macro environment, the team has done a great job with solid execution and an advantaged business translating into profitable growth and consistent share gains. Strategically speaking, the big news of the quarter was our announcement that we signed a deal to sell our mobility business to Platform Science and that we intend to become a major shareholder in the business. Further details are covered on Slide 11. For the combined business, this will create a scaled and focused software business that has a unique combined breadth of solutions needed to compete in the current environment. For Trimble, we will maintain a commercial relationship with the ongoing business. And at a company level, this enables us to further simplify and focus our attention and efforts in the areas where we have the most compelling right to win. Before handing over to Phil, in the last call, I talked about how I see Trimble as an AI winner. In the quarter, we continued to progress our AI efforts, both internally and externally facing. In this call, I'll end with a perspective on the macro environment. Geographically, the bookings we see are North America as the strongest market in Asia Pacific, excluding India, as the weakest market at the moment. By end markets, construction and transportation overall represent our book ends. Construction subsegments such as renewables, mega projects and infrastructure remain relatively strong. Residential remains challenged as do transportation end markets. In all environments, we anchor to our unique value proposition. What we sell enables work to be done better, faster, safer, cheaper and greener. The business is there, we need to be showing up in the right market segments with the right solutions and the right go-to-market motions. Phil, over to you. Thanks, Phil and thanks to all our Trimble colleagues and partners for delivering a solid quarter and a 2024 year-to-date of strategic and financial [indiscernible]. In the third quarter, we held our Signature User Conference in Las Vegas for a North American transportation business and our Signature User Conference for Transporeon in Vienna. We were able to see over 2,000 customers and partners with these 2 events. The overall feedback was positive on the mobility divestiture as well as the direction of travel of how Connect & Scale translates to digitize and connect the transportation supply chain. In less than 1 week, we will be back in Las Vegas at our Trimble Dimensions Engineering and Construction User Conference, where we will host over 6,000 attendees who are coming to learn how to further digitize and transform their work. In closing, we look forward to seeing many of you on December 10 in New York City at our Investor Day, where we will unpack our business and show you why we are so excited about our ability to win across our business lines with the right combination of products, people and go-to-market strategies. It's a busy and exciting time to be at Trimble. Operator, let's open the line to questions. Thanks for the question. ACV bookings across actually the entirety of the company were strong in the quarter. So we feel really good about that. That supports obviously, the ARR growth that we've already had and as well as the ARR guide that Phil took you through. Inside those ACV bookings, if we're looking inside the AECO business, TC1 was another highly successful quarter for that commercial offering and where we're doing the pre-packaged bundles. We see that the strong majority of our bookings, where we have TC1 available within AECO which is primarily within the engineering and construction applications, the strong majority are now TC1 bookings and those bookings are up more than the company average. And so within that, you have cross-sell and upsell happening. Similarly, in Transportation & Logistics segment, if we look at Transporeon on year-to-date, ACV bookings are up over 30% on a year-over-year basis. So a really nice progression from the teams in the quarter. Kristen, it's Rob. I'll take the question and thanks for the follow-up. I'll start with the lens of the customer on this. And both the Deere agreement and the CAT agreement help us grow the adoption of technology in the industry. And so what that means for a customer is that they're getting their choice of machine and technology and support to best fit their business. And that's both with John Deere and Caterpillar. And if you take John Deere specifically, what we're doing at the product level is enabling 3D upgrades on top of their platform, machine platform. At a go-to-market level, those upgrades can be enabled either through the John Deere dealer or through the Trimble network. At a competitive level or at a, let's call it, a channel -- potential channel complex level, I would characterize it as a no. We see it as complementary. And that's because we're not adequately serving that demand or that opportunity today. Thanks for the question, Rob. At a Connect & Scale level within Transportation & Logistics feel as good as ever about the opportunity and the evolution of the business and the business model and the opportunity. I mean, clearly, at a financial level to improve the metrics with a divestiture, I should say, mobility will improve the metrics, the growth and the profitability metrics and allow more, I call it, the goodness of the underlying portfolio to be seen. And I feel very good about the transaction that we're doing with Platform Science. I think together, this will be a scaled business that is well positioned to compete in today's marketplace. And we will have an ongoing commercial relationship. And to me, that's very important is that within that ongoing commercial relationship, call it, 2-way relationship, that ability to move data and to plug into our platform and our ecosystem, we think, can provide customers an ongoing differential level of outcomes. So good strategically, good at a capital allocation level, good at a focus level, helping us put more of our chips in the areas where we think we're best positioned to compete and where we have a right to win. From the Transporeon business specifically, both I'll call it at a product level or maybe call it strategic level across the whole portfolio, the teams have done a nice job bringing together some capabilities across both -- all of the businesses, both in the visibility side of things as well as in the freight marketplace. So like the moves the team are making to bring the businesses together, this is what we envisioned when we did the deal. And then in terms of the ongoing improvement in Transporeon I mean, hey, in the control that you can control aspect of things, bookings, to me, is the number one thing on my mind. Can't control the underlying freight market, especially in Europe which continues to be difficult. But we can control where we show up to compete. We are getting more than our fair share of wins with customers. These are some of the biggest logos in the world that we continue to win. I think the team is doing a really nice job. Those bookings wins up today, the nature of how bookings work in Transporeon as they do take a decent amount of time to actually come to full fruition. They ramp up, so they don't just flip the switch immediately because this is a consumption-based model in the form of primarily, I should say, 2/3 of the business models in the form of transactions on the marketplace. To see the real, say, improvement in the near term is in 2025, we need to see an improvement in the freight market to drive more transactions on the platform. A little bit cautious in Europe for 2025. So I would see that more as modest growth -- ongoing modest growth for Transporeon into 2025. And I think everything we've been doing this year and I think the team will continue to do in the fourth quarter into next year, will position that business to grow even faster coming out of next year. Jerry, it's Rob. I'll start and Phil can fill in. Hey, at the M&A level, we do have a pipeline. Our priority is with the software acquisitions. Within software, we're primarily looking -- where we're looking first within the AECO segment which I think would not be a surprise. We think where we have opportunities to do tuck-in is that we can create high return on investment outcomes and that's clearly important from a capital allocation perspective at what we call dry powder perspective, we're sitting at Phil walk through about 0.8x net debt to EBITDA, we've got a target to be below 2.5x [ph]. So there's, call it, call it $1.5 billion firepower should we -- say, should we need it but I don't anticipate putting that kind of capital to work. We are thinking a lot as well about the buyback as a big commitment we made and we stand behind that commitment on the buyback, especially with where we see the stock price today. So that's a balance we have, Jerry, is on the buyback and the M&A. Expect more of the tuck-in type moves, I would say, at a divestiture level and we do not expect any additional major moves to happen on that front. Hopefully, that helps answer your question. Jason, it's Rob. Did you mean Field Systems or the AECO? Okay. So within Field Systems, actually, at the revenue level, we ended where we anticipated to be in the quarter in Field Systems. What we see that's driving the business, there's the new product we've got a set of new products that are coming out actually at dimensions. Next week, we'll be making a number of new announcements, both on the software and the hardware side of the business. So we continue to bring new products in geospatial or the survey market forward like the R980 that's improving the communications and the range on that. In the machine control market, it hits the civil construction. Our BX992 offering helps us reach a mid-tier market. And our correction services or with compositioning services business, a technology called IonoGuard is correcting for errors in the ionosphere. This is through the solar cycle that's been ongoing and that's helping to ensure the accuracy of those signals and those corrections that we provide our customers around the world. So, new product introduction is helping to drive the revenue. I'm especially pleased with the growth of the ARR in the segment in the quarter and that's coming from the machine control service as -- excuse me, offering-as-a-service. It's in our positioning services business where we continue to win new OEMs in the automotive market. And we literally sell positioning as a service with a product called Trimble Catalyst and are looking to do more bundling with the term licenses and the correction services that we have. So it's a good number of activities happening. The team is executing well in addition, at the go-to-market with our channel partners around the world. So, really a nice intersection with the product and the go-to-market and the business and then the team doing a nice job working the business models. It's Rob and thanks for the question. Well, I have to say, we've depends on your time line of Fed rate cuts because we've been coming out of, I guess, a ZIRP environment, we've seen more Fed rate increases over the last few years and you've got to get the long baseline to go to go back to see an environment to anything like what we've been in that is to say, an inflationary environment that comes down. So it's hard to look back really in time and have anything that would, I think, be especially helpful. I would point out that what is so different about our business today compared to Trimble of the past is more than 75% software and more than 60% recurring. So we have a fundamentally different portfolio at such a higher degree of visibility into our business than we've ever had in the past. At the -- from what we hear and I would call it anecdotally is increased level of confidence and the confidence that turns into certainty, certainty can turn into ability to make the capital commitments. So I'd call that anecdotal. Of course, more than half of our business is outside the U.S., more than half of our hardware business is outside the U.S. And so we not only pay attention to the interest rate environment in the U.S. but globally as well. So, I think it's a little bit early to tell to say anything definitive other than to say anecdotally, we hear more confidence. And what if I think -- so one thing I am looking out for is -- and this is a North American example is, if you look at the bipartisan infrastructure law and you look at the amount of the money that's been deployed, only about 25%, plus or minus, of the funds have been deployed to date. So I call it good news in terms of the ongoing funding availability for the bipartisan infrastructure. And then, if you look at the cost of and let's take a U.S. example, every mile of road is about $1 million. And if you look then within each of the -- within that mile of road build, over $900,000 of that approximately is the raw materials, including the subsurface materials as well as the asphalt. The minority ends up being the machinery and the labor. And to the extent that inflation comes down on the materials, that's a good thing that if we can build more road with that. So that's half inflation coming down but I think that correlates to the interest rates coming down. So that's the kind of thing that we're paying attention to or the derivative -- second, third order derivative impacts. It's a good question. I would say more -- there is a -- how do I say this; there's a variety of growth outcomes that we have within the A, the E, the C and the O. I wanted to point out that they're each above $200 million to point out the balance we have in it. So we don't have a dependent -- an overdependency on one aspect of the portfolio. And I think that's important message to get across and that was the intent of that. With the growth rates specifically, actually, our architecture and design business, kudos and shout out to the team for the last 3 to 4 years, let's say, well outgrown at an ARR growth level the rest of the of the portfolio. And we think it's probably the largest addressable market opportunity we have with the SketchUp product. We crossed the threshold last quarter of over 1 million paid subscribers using the technology. It's the one that's got the largest customer reach in the world for Trimble. So that aspect of -- or that part of the business is growing the fastest. I think it will probably still continue to grow the fastest for the next couple of years. I'd say the growth within the E and the C parts of AECO are pretty similar and I don't see that changing over time over the next couple of years, excuse me. And then the O, that -- sort of we call that the owner in the public sector. The public sector does grow at a lower rate than the private sector. We think one of the things that I think though tends to be quite attractive within the public sector is net retention tends to be high which is to say churn very low. So, gross retention tends to be the highest in that side of the business; so well balanced. Growth rates are differential but not enough, I think, to change our view here in the next couple of years of the growth opportunity for the business where we would see ARR continuing to grow in the teens. Let me start with the macro and Phil can fill in some of the margin dynamics. And at a macro level, I wouldn't expect really any meaningful change from what we know now. I mean, after all, January 1 will just be the day after December 31. So it's hard for me to say that I see big, meaningful changes in the market. We've seen the North American economy stronger than the European economy. I would expect that to continue. We've seen subsegments such as data centers, renewable energy, onshoring of manufacturing to be strong and stronger than residential. If interest rates continue to come down, I think that could be a positive inflection to the residential end market. So we're paying attention to that because we know that that's underbuilt and that will come back over time. In the Field Systems side, we certainly look at what the OEMs are saying and they're projecting units down in construction and agriculture and that's incorporated into our thoughts on Field Systems. Now we still expect it to grow next year but to be below the company average on growth. And so that's taken into -- we're trying to take that into account. And transportation and the macros, I think that 2025 could start to look better for the macros in North America. There do appear to be some green shoots coming to get supply and demand and to better balance. In Europe, I would expect more of the same as a default thinking. So we're not expecting to see an inflection in -- meaningful inflection in the number of transactions per customer that would impact -- that would positively impact the Transporeon business were to be wrong in that and the economy were to be better. So some of those macro thoughts make it into the revenue, I don't know if we call it guidance yet but I'll call it revenue early revenue thoughts that Phil put forward. Phil, do you want to fill in the rest? And I also would -- this is Rob again. I point out that we have the earnings supplement. I'd encourage everyone to make sure you're looking through that because there are moving parts that we need to make sure that you're taking into account moving parts. One will be the mobility divestiture, assuming it happens which we assume in Q1. We've got the -- we'll have the agriculture that will lap in Q1, so thus, the as adjusted. And then the third big one is the 53rd week that we've got here in 2024. And so it's just -- it's really important to understand these pieces and work from the right baseline. Otherwise, it can look -- it will look off, especially with the 53rd week and the divestitures. And so we're thinking about it very much on an organic basis, excluding that 53rd week when we make this commentary. Chad, great question. Okay. So within AECO, the primary place where we're selling it today is with the E and the C part of the portfolio, where we sell to the engineering and construction customers, by the way, that could be mechanical, electrical, plumbing, steel, concrete contractors, the general contractors who do both vertical and horizontal work. Those are the primary customer set where we're selling it today. Anywhere where those customers can use architecture and design product, SketchUp we are selling it into those bundles. For our pure architects and only architects and only designers, they're not really buying TC1. They're buying -- they're just buying the product that they need Okay. So within the engineering and construction part of the AECO primarily, as you know, it's been already out in North America. TC1 is a framework commercial offering. We've got over 20 pre-packaged subofferings within that to target the personas. Then we're, I'd say, early in the European rollout and really not in Asia Pacific in a meaningful way, especially Southeast Asia, not in any meaningful way. I would anticipate next year that we really see Europe rolled out and I would say, probably partially so in Asia Pacific. We've got to have some of the underlying systems work done to help enable that which rolls out geographically. Then you asked about the O and bringing that owner in public sector into that and we'll start to see more of that next year. Now the owner and public sector actually already has its own form of TC1. We call it Trimble Unity where we brought together multiple capabilities we have around enterprise asset management and digital project delivery. And so that has come together in the form of a suite of technology to serve asset life cycle management which we think is actually super unique. So what we'll do is continue to pursue asset life cycle management within the owner and public sector, have the linkages to TC1. The extent of whether it is or isn't called TC1, I'm a bit indifferent, I'm more focused on we're delivering the outcomes to the customers. The other thing I'd want to take a chance to point out is, next year, you'll see, we'll see more linkages to the machine control and guidance market where we have an as-a-service offering, linking that into the TC1 bundles for civil contractors. And if you take a capability like we have with B2W, I think, estimating and tracking field progress for civil contractors, that makes a lot of sense to link to the construction ERP that civil contractors buy from us, to link that to the machine control and guidance that they can buy from us, to link that to the project management the in-product controls that they buy from us, not only to link the technology, to link the workflow. And these are the things that we can uniquely do at that intersection of the physical and the digital. So, I look forward to seeing more rollouts next year. When you ask about the addressable market, what we have seen consistently through the rollouts of the bundles that we are expanding the size of the addressable markets. We're expanding the reach we have in the customers as we move into more of an as-a-service offering. This is Rob. I'll start within Transporeon. The bookings were the record bookings both for the both for the quarter. It was a record third quarter level of bookings. It was the second highest quarter ever bookings, put it more longitudinally to the year and about 30% increase year-to-date on a year-over-year basis. Those bookings are primarily coming from new logos and then increasing -- there's a land and expand play we have within the portfolio because there's a broad set of capabilities that the platform can deliver. And so that cross-sell of the rest of the capabilities is also driving a level of bookings. I'd say, in that business, I'm most pleased with the level of the new bookings and we were able to meet good number of existing as well as new logo customers at our User Conference just a few weeks ago in Vienna. And the customers are looking for -- both by the way the carriers and the shippers are looking for efficiencies that the platform can unlock. They're looking -- and we're seeing nice growth within the autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation product lines within the business. This is AI at work generating revenue and actually being monetized which I am really pleased to see. So we've got a differential set of products and capabilities and outcomes that we can deliver to the customers. We're primarily selling to the shippers. We bring them into the network and then they fulfill and execute through the carriers that are in the network. At the TC1 level, let me make sure I understood your question. Are you looking for color on what's driving that growth or what else we're doing within... Yes. So yes, let's start with the bookings. The bookings were right at or probably actually slightly above the level of the ARR growth in the quarter. That informs the view forward that Phil talked about in his prepared remarks. We have an enormous ability to cross-sell and upsell within the existing customer base that we have. And so that's where we do see the majority of the growth that we have in the business. And we are winning new logos. We have a differential offering. And the more we can link the bundles and the workflows together, we're seeing that generate new logo wins for us. The team has done just a really, I think, a terrific job throughout the year, actually throughout the last few years but let's just say, throughout the year to date, both at a product level, at go-to-market level and the underlying systems level. So at a product level, I think delivering -- defining and delivering the TC1 bundles, linking the workflow, establishing a marketplace where we can do integrations and have a sets of APIs to be able to integrate the technology that we have, defining the bundles. We're seeing good success when we have like ERP and project management, when we link ERP and estimating when, we link design and estimating. So we're following what the customers and the market are telling us to define the product set to take to market. At a go-to-market level, earlier in the year, we moved to a named account selling model and it's working. And then at a systems and process level, sales enablement, sales operations, getting 360-degree views of our customers, underlying marketing transformation to drive the pipeline. The pieces are coming together nicely in the business. And then linking that to one of the earlier questions, this is -- gives us the ability to take this across the rest of the world from what we've already been doing in North America and part of Europe fully into Europe and then into Asia Pacific. And I would think the answer is yes, we would anticipate having it done before Investor Day. Thank you."

            "name": "Phil Sawarynski",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. As noted before, my financial commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis which excludes our agriculture business but will still include the mobility business. We believe that maximizing long-term free cash flow drives shareholder value. Connect & Scale is our strategy which we believe will continue to deliver recurring revenue growth, margin expansion and ultimately, cumulative cash flow growth. Slide 12 highlights balance sheet and cash flow dynamics. Our cash flow continues to trend better than expected after considering M&A transaction impacts. 2024 year-to-date reported free cash flow was $389 million. That includes $87 million of tax payments related to our gain on sale of the agriculture business as well as $66 million in M&A-related transaction expenses. Our conversion ratio through the first 3 quarters of 2024 without these items was well above our target of 1x non-GAAP net income. We have additional tax payments impacting future operating cash flow related to the agriculture JV gain on sale in our fourth quarter of 2024 and second quarter of 2025 since the tax payments are spread out over time. Our asset-light model continues with capital expenditures about 1% of revenue and negative net working capital. Net debt to EBITDA stands at less than 1x, well below our long-term leverage target of 2.5x. We have just over $1 billion in cash after paying down our term debt and the outstanding balances on our credit facilities. Our capital allocation focus remains the same where we invest and where we see opportunities for the highest returns. We continue to disproportionately allocate capital to our AECO business, where a significant percent of our operating expense increases are in our sales and marketing engines to continue to drive ARR and revenue growth and ultimately margin expansion and free cash flow generation. On the merger and acquisition front, we expect to opportunistically pursue tuck-in acquisitions primarily in the AECO segment where we can quickly integrate and bundle within Trimble Construction One. Our 2 recent acquisitions in AECO continue to demonstrate that our M&A playbook is working. The human resources application we purchased about a year ago was quickly integrated into our Viewpoint ERP and we have already over tripled the ARR and almost quadrupled the customer accounts for the product in that first year. The payments application we purchased in the second quarter is ahead of our initial integration plans into the Viewpoint ERPs and we are seeing bookings well in excess of our deal models. These growth opportunities are enabled by our Connect & Scale strategy via bundled product offerings that we put in the hands of our sellers. This playbook is a critical part of our acquisition strategy going forward. With that, let's turn to Slide 13 and talk about guidance for the remainder of the year. We have a 53rd week in fiscal 2024 which adds approximately $85 million of revenue and $50 million of operating income, mainly driven by term license renewals on January 1 which falls in the fourth quarter of this year. We are holding our ARR growth at 11% to 13% but are biased towards the higher end of the range with the AECO performance offset by the churn in our mobility business that we previously discussed. We are increasing the midpoint of our as-reported full year revenue guidance by $15 million from $3.63 billion to $3.645 billion. AECO revenue is slightly better than our prior guide due to the performance in the first 3 quarters. Field Systems revenue is also slightly up and transportation is unchanged. Correspondingly, the full year earnings per share midpoint is increasing by $0.09 to $2.83 from the prior $2.74. Our as-adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to be between 27.5% and 27.8% which is approximately an 80-basis-point improvement at the midpoint from our prior guide. Free cash flow conversion for the year is approximately 0.75x non-GAAP net income which includes $116 million of taxes from the gain on sale from the agriculture JV and as well as approximately $85 million in full year M&A costs. Without these items, we'd be above the 1x non-GAAP net income for the year and an improvement from the prior guide. Let's move to our fourth quarter on Slide 14 which is consistent with our prior guide. I will focus again on our as-adjusted view which excludes agriculture. Our outlook for ARR growth remained strong with continued expectations for 11% to 13% organic growth with a bias to the higher end. Our total company revenue is projected to be $925 million to $965 million which includes approximately $85 million due to the 53rd week. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding the 53rd week, our revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 1% to 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 28.5% to 30% and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 30% to 31.5% for the fourth quarter. Our EPS forecast is in the range of $0.83 to $0.91. One more item I'd like to mention before turning it back over to Rob. As we think about the financial model going into 2025, it is critical to make the correct pro forma adjustments for the ag and mobility divestitures, along with the 53rd week. I'll point you to the earnings supplement on our Investor site where we consolidated the adjustments in one place. For 2025, we expect continued double-digit organic ARR growth. Starting from a baseline of pro forma 2024 revenue, we continue to believe that with the shift to higher-growth software, we are biased above the midpoint of the last Investor Day range of 5% to 8% organic revenue growth. We expect AECO to be above this range. Transportation is expected to be in this range after the divestiture of mobility which we are now expecting to close in the first quarter of 2025. We're expecting Field Systems to return to growth but be below this range. Rob, I'll turn it back over to you. Jerry, it's Phil. Let me take that and then Rob can add if he needs to. It's a great question. I appreciate it. As we think about 2025, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, AECO above that range. Transportation in that range and remember, that's ex mobility. And then Field Systems being below that range. Now we still believe Field Systems will return to growth but it will be sort of low single-digit growth to get there. And a couple of the elements around Field Systems. So one is, we talked about the Fed this year. We believe the Fed business still will be down next year which provides a little bit of a headwind. The other piece of that, as we think about the CAT JV evolution, we are going to be part of the economics of that. We believe there are going to be some shift of the revenue to the factory fit. And so as we think about that long term, with the channel evolution that we talked about and going after the mixed fleets, call it, past 2025, we believe that, that will offset and more than offset any of the impacts on the factory fit. But for 2025, that revenue, there's a couple of points of headwind because of that. And then if I actually talk about the profit related to that, one of the other elements of the JV is we changed how we're pricing -- Trimble is pricing some of the products into the JV. And so what happens is, even though there's a couple of points of headwind on the revenue, there's additional profit that shifts from the JV to Trimble. And then if you net-net all of those puts and takes down to the EBITDA level, we believe that it's neutral for the rest of '24 and it's neutral for '25 on a profit standpoint. So that's a little bit more color, I guess, on the Field Systems. But we do see Field Systems growing, let's call it, low single digits next year. Thanks, Jason. This is Phil. Yes, so if you remember, I mentioned this, we have the mobility headwind with a lot of the known churn that's going to happen at the end of this year. So my 2 comments were, one, I said 11% to 13% but biased toward the high end. We still see the continued strength in the AECO business. But where we're seeing some of the offset is that known churn around mobility in Q4. Tami, it's Phil. I can take that one. Yes. So obviously, we'll get into more detail at Investor Day but last earnings call -- I'll sort of reiterate what I said last earnings call which was we're biased -- as we think about the long-term model, we're biased above the midpoint of our prior Investor Day model which was 5% to 8%. So that sort of gives you the revenue number. As we continue to grow the software business disproportionate to the hardware business, you would expect the gross margin expansion. And then we talked about the operating leverage last time it being 30%, 35%. So we're biased towards the high end of that. And then if you put that all together with some expansion at the EBITDA level, we said over the time, we could expect probably 100 basis points of margin expansion. Again, that's over a multiyear view. But we can get into more details on the Investor Day as well. Yes. So Clarke, this is Phil. Let me start and Rob can add any color. So as we think about -- as you said, as we got rid of or as we divested the mobility business going into 2025, that's been obviously a drag on our growth and our ARR growth this year. So we mentioned that before. So then when you have what's left is you've got the MAPS business which is performing well, continues to grow. I think we grew sort of high single digits ARR growth in Q3. Rob had already talked about the Transporeon business. And we're not forecasting right now for 2025 any meaningful change in the overall market. But he mentioned the bookings growth. And it's been a healthy business on our growth. It's been double digit, call it, revenue growth and accretive on the OI. So when you think about those businesses continuing to perform at that level, I would expect additional growth and margin expansion from those businesses as we go forward. Yes. Thanks, Chad. So I'd say, again, we weren't -- this wasn't intended to be a guide -- a full guide for next year is just to give you a preview of how we're thinking about the year on a revenue basis. But I think you could roughly apply the construct that I talked about earlier around the growth and the gross margin expansion, the op leverage. And you can use the revenue growth rates that I alluded to which is AECO being the top transportation being in the range and Field Systems being lower and I think you can get to a rough model there. But certainly at Investor Day and as we go forward, we can give you more detailed view on that for 2025. This is Phil. Let me start. So look, this is the number one priority for us. We're trying to work through this. E&Y has been performing incremental audit procedures. They're really focused on completing this but in a very thorough and detailed manner. And so I think back when we thought it was a few weeks away, we underestimated sort of just the breadth and depth of the audit as it went forward. So I think that was on us. But they're doing their work. The team is -- the Trimble team is very focused on this. We've put in outside resources throughout this process. But what I will reiterate is Rob's comment that throughout these many months, we pulled many, many data samples and we still have not seen anything that would indicate a restatement of any of our financial statements that to date, the financial statements that we filed, we believe are correct. So we're continuing to work hard with them. Again, we're trying to get this completed as soon as possible. But unfortunately, it's just one of those we, as Trimble can't control the time line. And so all we can do is put our heads down and work really hard and be very responsive to the UI requests and try to get this behind us as soon as we can."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Trimble Second Quarter 2024 financial results conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Painter, Trimble President and CEO. Please go ahead.\nRob Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which refer to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. In addition, our P&L commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis, which excludes our agriculture business. Let's start on Slide 4. During the second quarter, we continued to advance our connect and scale strategy, which involves digitally connecting the workflows within targeted industry segments and creating scale across Trimble through shared technology platforms. Our strategy delivers outcomes in the form of unique value to our customers and sustainable value creation to our shareholders. We want to convey three key messages today; the strategy is working, the numbers reflect the execution, and the execution reflects our simplified and focused organization. Slides 5 and 6 detail some highlight metrics. $2.11 billion of ARR grew 14%. Revenue grew 1%. Gross margins were a record 66.5%. EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 24.6%, and free cash flow was strong. Revenue in the quarter was 75% software services recurring, and 60% overall recurring revenue, both records for Trimble, reflecting our portfolio transformation and continued organic mix shift driven by ARR growth. Based on the solid first half year performance, we are raising our guidance for the year. Before we turn to the performance of the segments, let me provide an update on the status of our financial audit. By way of reminder, the need for EY\u2019s re-audit over 2023 financials stems from concerns about the comprehensiveness and documentation of a number of our internal controls, especially around our IT systems. These concerns arose as EY prepared for a PCAOB inspection of their audit of Trimble. In April, EY began additional audit procedures relating to our 2023 financial statements using a more detailed substantive approach. We are working collaboratively with EY, and provided them with the substantial majority of the information they need. EY\u2019s work is nearing completion and we expect it to wrap up within the next month or so. To date, the audit has not identified any issues which would result in a change of our financial statements. When EY\u2019s work is complete, we will reissue our annual report for 2023 and file Forms 10-Q for the first and second quarter of 2024. Based on the work to date, we anticipate that the financial results will be the same as what we have previously reported. Let's get back to the business with a review of our segment results, starting on slide seven with our AECO segment. The team delivered another record quarter of ARR, with a terrific 18% level of ARR growth. The AECO segment is the tip of the spear of our connect and scale strategy, and the strategy is working. We are succeeding in growing customer count with our innovative products and driving higher revenue per customer through our integrated platform offering. The A represents architecture and design. Here, our SketchUp product surpassed 1 million subscribers, an amazing milestone delivered by the team. The E represents engineering. An example of the strategy at work here comes in the form of unique workflows that only Trimble can deliver, such as scan, BIM, and fabrication workflows. The C represents construction. Here, our recent tuck-in acquisitions of field and payment solutions have shown us that we can run repeatable land and expand plays that deliver our customers fast time to value when they buy additional capabilities on top of our construction management system. The O represents the owners, both private and public sector. In May, we held a user conference in Cleveland where we launched Trimble Unity, a suite of asset lifecycle management solutions that uniquely connect Trimble capabilities. Across these AECO personas, we operate a common and connected data environment, namely Trimble Connect. Connect has now initiated more than 20 million projects since inception, and had over 6 billion API hits into the platform in just the first six months of 2024. On the go-to-market side, we moved the team to a named account selling model earlier this year, and we are now lining up our digital marketing efforts to better enable our sales motions. In conclusion, the connect and scale investments we have made over the last several years have enabled us to grow and gain share. Our strategy resonates with customers looking for strong ROIs. Based on our second quarter results, our pipeline, and our solid bookings performance, we see our momentum continuing. We recently hired a Chief Revenue Officer for this business, which we believe will help further enable and ensure our growth and success at scale in this $1.16 billion ARR business that is already operating well above a rule of 40 benchmark. The physical side of our business is largely conveyed in our field systems reporting segment, with key highlights on Slide 8. Revenue was down as expected, primarily related to the strength of prior year government-related sales. While in-market conditions have been soft in some areas, we continue to perform well, with strong product and channel positions. Nowhere is this more evident than in the more than $300 million of field systems ARR. The team has been doing a great job of converting relevant software and hardware models, where we have the ability to leverage our strong market position and product offerings to deliver unique value to customers. This motion has expanded our addressable market, as evidenced by delivering 17% ARR growth, nearly matching the growth in AECO. I'll illustrate this through three examples, starting with our Works Plus offering in civil construction, which offers machine control and guidance as a service. The team delivered a record quarter of bookings. Second, our Positioning Services business has expanded our unique ability to offer globally ubiquitous and high accuracy signals from our classic geospatial and agriculture markets into automotive markets. The team delivered three design wins in the quarter to major automotive OEMs. And third, we launched the R980 GNSS survey instrument in the quarter, with firmware configurations, field software, and Positioning Services available on a subscription basis, which expands the addressable market by lowering upfront costs, enabling more customers to adopt our premium solutions. Strategically speaking, most of the solutions we sell in this segment act as a data collection node in the physical world to provide us the unique Trimble ability to connect to the physical and digital world. Closing our segment commentary on Slide 9, transportation and logistics beat our top and bottom-line expectations. Transporeon delivered double-digit ARR growth, as did our maps business. Excluding the North America mobility business, organic ARR growth in this segment was 11%. While our mobility business has experienced the churn we anticipated, it is worth noting that the team delivered the largest bookings in the last few years in the quarter, which was one half a technology upgrade with Trimble, and one half a competitive displacement. Our new Instinct platform is generating positive buzz in the market, and we are having good success selling video solutions. While the freight market remains in a recessionary environment, our Transporeon business continued to win new logos in the quarter, and we continue to innovate on all our solutions, some of which will be unveiled at our user conferences in September. In addition, we are moving down the path of product rationalization between the Trimble and Transporeon businesses, as evidenced by consolidating our work on freight marketplace and visibility and to one team each. We also began selling our mapping solutions into the Transporeon customer base. The sum of these activities delivered 18.7% operating income, a solid 460 basis point increase. Before handing over to Phil to walk us through more of the numbers, I wanted to offer a perspective on why we see Trimble as an AI winner. Starting with our own internal usage, we now have over 2,500 engineers using GitHub Copilot and more than 5,000 Trimble colleagues using an internal version of Microsoft Azure OpenAI that we call Trimble Assistant. From a customer-facing perspective, we have beta and production releases of AI capabilities in a number of areas. In AECO, we automate the extraction of PDF data into submittal logs and into estimating engines. We also transform 3D BIM models into photorealistic renderings. In field systems, we focus on feature extraction from 3D point clouds. In transportation, our AI solutions include customer support, autonomous procurement, and autonomous quotation systems that match shippers with carriers. We've included several examples of Trimble AI in the appendix of the slides, complete with hyperlinks. Our thesis on AI is that the density of domain-specific data and insight will separate the AI winners and losers. With our unique scale that includes over $1 trillion of construction capital programs, tens of billions of dollars of freight transactions running through our systems, millions of global customers, and hundreds of thousands of instruments and machines in the physical world, we believe we have a compelling right to win and a defensible moat to continue building around our business. Phil?\nPhil Sawarynski: Thank you, Rob. As noted before, my financial commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis, which excludes our agriculture business. We believe that maximizing long-term free cash flow drives shareholder value. Connect and scale is our strategy, which we believe will continue to deliver recurring revenue growth, margin expansion, and ultimately cumulative cash flow growth. Slide 10 highlights balance sheet and cash flow dynamics. On cash flow, we are trending better than expected after considering the transaction-related impacts. Reported free cash flow in the first half of 2024 was $300 million, that includes $50 million of tax payments related to our gain on sale from the AG JV, as well as $54 million in M&A-related transaction expenses. Our conversion ratio in the first half of 2024 without these items was well above our target of 1x net income. We'll have additional tax payments impacting future operating cash flow related to the AG JV gain on sale in our third and fourth quarters of 2024 and second quarter of 2025, since the tax payments are spread out over time. Our asset-light model continues, with capital expenditures less than 2% of revenue and negative net working capital. Net debt to EBITDA after the close of the AG JV stands at less than 1x, well below our long-term leverage target of 2.5x. We have just under $1 billion in cash after paying down our term debt and the outstanding balances on our credit facilities. We intend to resume our share buyback when practical. Our capital allocation focus remains the same. We invest where we see opportunities for the highest returns. We continue to disproportionately allocate capital to our AECO business where the bulk of our operating expense increases are in our sales and marketing engines to continue to drive ARR, revenue growth, and ultimately margin expansion. On the M&A front, we expect to opportunistically pursue tuck-in acquisitions primarily in the AECO segment where we can quickly integrate and bundle within Trimble Construction One. We acquired a field human resources application in the third quarter of 2023, and we also recently acquired a payments offering branded as Trimble Pay that has been integrated with Viewpoint, and for both, we are seeing bookings well in excess of our deal models. These growth opportunities are enabled by our connect and scale strategy via bundled product offerings that we put in the hands of our sellers. This is a playbook that is delivering results and is a critical part of our acquisition strategy going forward. With that, let's turn to Slide 11 and talk about guidance for the remainder of the year. We have a 53rd week in fiscal 2024, which adds approximately $85 million of revenue and $50 million of operating income, mainly driven by term license renewals on January 1st, which falls in the fourth quarter of this year. We are increasing the midpoint of our as-reported full-year revenue guidance by $10 million from $3.62 billion to $3.63 billion, which also overcomes foreign currency headwinds. We are also increasing the full year earnings per share midpoint by $0.04 to $2.74 from the prior $2.70. AECO revenue is slightly better than our prior guide due to the first half performance and strong bookings in the prior quarters. Field systems revenue is down slightly, and transportation is unchanged. We maintain our strong ARR growth range from 11% to 13%, driven primarily by the expectation of mid to high teens growth in AECO, offset largely by the previously disclosed churn in our North American transportation mobility business. Our EBITDA margin for the year is expected to be between 26.7% and 27.2%. Free cash flow conversion for the year is updated to be approximately 0.75x net income, which includes $116 million of anticipated tax on gain from the JV I noted earlier, as well as approximately $75 million in full-year M&A costs. Without these items, we would be above 1x net income for the year, and an improvement from our prior guide. Let's move to our third quarter guidance on Slide 12, which is consistent with our prior guide. I'll focus again on our as-adjusted view, excluding agriculture. Our outlook for ARR growth remains strong, with continued expectations for 11% to 13% organic growth despite the North American transportation mobility headwind I mentioned earlier. Our total company revenue is projected to be $840 million to $880 million. On an as-adjusted basis, our revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of flat to up 4% year-over-year, and is showing improvement relative to the second quarter, mainly due to strong government sales in the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%, and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 24% to 25% for the third quarter. Our EPS forecast is in the range of $0.58 to $0.64, which is, again, consistent with our prior guide. I would also like to point out that we included a new supplement in our materials that is available on our Investor Relations website. This is to provide a summary of our results, along with assumptions behind our guidance model in a readily available format. One more item I'd like to mention before turning it back over to Rob. As we think about the financial model in a multi-year context, I refer to our Investor Day numbers from September 2022. Our long-term target model projected that revenue would grow in the 5% to 8% range organically. Normalizing for the benefit of the extra week in fiscal year 2024, we believe with the continued shift to higher growth software, we are biased above the midpoint of this range. We also had forecasted operating leverage in the range of 30% to 35%. Given the mix shift to software with higher gross margins, we would expect operating leverage going forward to be at or above the high end of this range. Thus, we see the potential to expand operating margins in the range of 100 basis points or more annually. We look forward to providing more details and an update on our long range financial plan at our Investor Day in New York City on December 10th. Rob, I'll turn it back over to you.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Phil, and thank you to all our Trimble colleagues and partners for delivering a solid first half of the year and for demonstrating resilience and conviction as we continue to transform how we work so that we can transform how the world works. I'll end with a fun fact related to the games in Paris. Our technology was leveraged for the design, engineering, and construction of many of the stadiums, such as the aquatic center, the sailing marina, the football stadium, and also for athletic housing. The Les Gradins building, which houses over 400 athletes, will be converted to an office building after the games conclude. On the project, our survey kit, engineering, and prefabrication technologies, were used to construct a sustainable structure and to deliver it on time. Trimble Connect was used as a collaboration platform to coordinate across hundreds of users and stakeholders. To quote the BIM engineering manager on the project, I find Trimble Connect to be the best collaboration platform on the market in terms of file quality and usability. You can tell they designed the tool to be easy to use, even for non-experts. Operator, let's open the line to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kristen Owen of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nKristen Owen: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question, and congratulations on the nice quarter. I wanted to ask about the 18% AECO ARR, clearly ahead of our expectations. You lifted the guidance there, and when I look across the landscape of software categories in which you compete, it seems to me like maybe there's an opportunity for Trimble to pick up some share as we think about some of the pricing and channel shifts that we've seen. So, I'm just wondering if you can help us unpack the sources of growth there. Is it cross-sell, upsell, new logos, price, et cetera? Any additional color that you can provide there would be helpful.\nRob Painter: Thanks, Kristen, for the question and good morning. So, let's break down a little bit there within the ARR growth, starting with a congrats to the team. It really was a terrific post of a number for the quarter. About two thirds of that growth is coming from existing customers and one third from new logos. And so, we really - for the breadth and depth of the portfolio we have, there's a great ability for us to package cross-sell, upsell, and that comes in the form of the Trimble Construction One offering where we now have over 20 pre-packaged offerings to serve specific personas across the industry continuum. If we look at the segments that we're serving within construction, where we see strong growth are in data centers. We see the onshoring and reshoring of renewable energy work. These end markets have been strong, and private data centers have been the strongest. We actually have also had some growth in residential. So, even though there's weakness there, we've seen growth there. One thing that's unique too, Kristen, about the data set that we have, because we're managing over $1 trillion of committed construction programs through our systems, over $0.5 trillion through the ERP alone, is there's a lot of data we can see. And so, in North America, we can see that jobs are up. Hiring's up. That is jobs are up. We can see that the volumes are up. We can see geographic strengths within States here in the US. We can see that States like South Carolina, Florida, Texas, have been very strong. We can see states like New York and Louisiana have been weaker. So, we're able to get a good insight into the market. And then differentially across the world, North America for sure is performing better than Europe and Asia Pacific. So, hope that gives you some color.\nKristen Owen: Thanks for that. And my follow-up here, this is the first real conversation we've heard Trimble have about AI. You\u2019re giving some of the examples at the back, which we'll have to go back and look into, but one of the questions that we've seen in AI on the market has been, how do you monetize it? So, can you help us understand whether it's the Copilot or utilization or the autonomous procurement? Just help us understand the value creation or monetization opportunity for Trimble in leveraging that technology. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Yes, it's a great question, Kristen. We're still in the very early innings of monetization. We're paying a lot of attention to it. Now, you talked about the GitHub Copilot work. That's internal productivity. So, the lens I have on this is, there's a set of work in AI that's for making us more efficient and productive inside our own house. That could be how we're doing customer support using the chat bots. It is the productivity through the code development. It's getting sharper about how we do our marketing efforts, leveraging AI when we go more customer-oriented, and those are the examples I had in the prepared remarks, and then we put a slide in the appendix with some hyperlinks so you can go look at some examples of what we're doing in the market. I'd give you sort of two breakdowns on that. One is that we see it as - some of this is part of continuous value delivery to our customers. That is, they're paying subscriptions. We typically get price increases every year. I think there's a reasonable expectation that we're providing incremental value. And in that sense, it's part of the offering that we do. The distinction I would make is when we have more breakthrough productivity or breakthrough value that we can provide customers, we think about, okay, what's the - quantifying that value and then what's our fair share of that capture? One example I can point out is in - within our Transporeon business, is the team has developed autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation capabilities. And when customers are using that instead of the traditional methods they've used and solutions they've used within Transporeon, we're monetizing that at I think of 2x to 3x (indiscernible) to 2x factor for execution because the result is that much better for the customers. So, that's one example of where we're monetizing, and I'd say we're still pretty early in it. And you're right that this is certainly evolving in the monetization side of things.\nKristen Owen: Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino - KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nZane Meehan: Great. This is Zane Meehan on per Jason Celino this morning. Thanks for taking my question. Rob, first one for you. With the elections in the US coming up later this year, I'm just curious to hear if you're hearing any customers delaying buying decisions as a result of that, and if so, if that's contemplated in the 3Q and full-year guidance?\nRob Painter: Hey, thanks for the question. Relative to the election, I mean, you typically hear that in these periods, that people will do a bit of a pause to kind of see which way the wind's going to blow, and we'll see which way the wind blows. We believe we've taken that into account in the guide that we've put forward. And if you think about the guide, think about the visibility we have with the ARR business is much higher than we would have on let's say the hardware business, which manifests more as a book-and-burn. So, we have visibility into the rest of the year, differential visibility. 60% of our revenue is now recurring as a company. 75% of our revenue overall is software services and recurring. It's certainly reasonable for us to - and all of us, I guess, to think about what the impact of the election might be on our business, whether that's around regulation or whether that's around tariffs, depending on which way this goes. But we believe we've got this taken into account.\nZane Meehan: Okay, great. That's super helpful. Thanks. And then second question, Phil, for you. On the margin side, it's nice to see the little uptick in the guide. Just curious, is that coming more from the revenue outperformance or are you getting leverage from specific line item? Just curious to hear further info on the margin uptake.\nPhil Sawarynski: Yes, thanks, Zane. Hey, the main reason for really the mix shift is our AECO business, continues to grow at a faster rate of the - than the field systems. And we have a little bit better first half and those bookings start to flow through in the second half. And so, I think what you're seeing is then that mix shift, which obviously the gross margin on the AECO business is higher than the field systems. And so, you're seeing that sort of flow through in the back half of the year.\nZane Meehan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi good morning, everyone. Rob, nice to hear about the logo growth at Transporeon. Can you just expand on that? What was the logo growth in the quarter? What was the transaction count? Can you just expand more on the performance in the quarter and to the extent you have visibility on how the cadence looked into July and August for that business, please?\nRob Painter: Sure. Hey, let me frame this in two ways, one with the first half of the year, and then secondarily with the second quarter specifically. For the first half of the year, the bookings growth in the Transporeon business was in the mid to high teens. So, super pleased with that performance in context of what still is a freight recession. And so, the way then you can grow that bookings is coming through winning deals. And in the second quarter, the team won over 250 deals. Those deals come in the form of landing dozens of new logos and also doing land and expand plays within the existing customer base. There are certainly some pockets of end markets that are stronger and others that are weaker. There's been some strength coming back on the retail side. Some of the building materials have - that side of the business has been lower for the business. The team also had some success getting traction here in north America as well, which we were pleased by. And then last thing I'll comment on is we've got more plays happening between the Transporeon and Trimble Transportation business. Still early in that, but I like what I'm seeing in terms of the teams working together. So, add that up and that's the color around the numbers.\nJerry Revich: Super. Thank you. And can I ask a similar question for AECO. I mean, that business has been growing consistently around 17%, 18% really since you've acquired E-Builder and Viewpoint. Can you unpack the growth profile now? How much is the logo growth that we're seeing this year versus cross-selling, and how much runway do you see based on the pipeline and opportunity set to continue to deliver this pretty consistent level of growth that you've put on I think for about five years now?\nRob Painter: Sure, Jerry. So, the growth is about two thirds from existing customers and one third from new logo customers. And you're right, the team has consistently been posting excellent growth. And this is excellent growth at scale. I mean, AECO alone is a $1.16 billion ARR business today, growing ARR in the high teens, operating at a rule of 44 in the quarter. It was over rule of 50 in the first quarter. Net retention is about 108% in the business. So, a lot of good things happening in the business. We believe we're winning because we have a unique value proposition. The value proposition is delivering productivity, quality, safety, environmental sustainability to our customers. It's helping them solve higher order problems for customers and ability, especially when we have the TC - where we have the TC One offerings available. That's Trimble Construction One. It reduces friction in the buying process. It makes it easier for customers to do business with us. It's doing things with Trimble that you can uniquely do, that is connecting work in the field and work in the office. So, when we look at the base of the customers that we have, we're bullish in our ability to continue growing this business, especially when I look at that two-third, one-third split, and two thirds being from existing customers.\nJerry Revich: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hull of William Blair. Your line is open.\nJonathan Hull: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to see if you could give us a little bit of additional color on the go-to-market changes that you're making around the named account executives for Trimble Connect, and maybe help us understand how that could potentially drive faster adoption of the Trimble platform.\nRob Painter: Hi. Good morning, Jonathan. So, yes, we moved - in the AECO business, we moved to a named account selling model at the beginning of the year. It was definitely a huge change for the team and for the organization. And if you think about it, if you're going to - if you sort of rewind, call it five, 10 years ago, we might have sent multiple sellers in to talk to a given customer. Today, that moves to having one person who's got accountability for that account, and then accountability to bring in the specialist behind her or him in order to best serve that customer and meet the breadth of needs. Now, it's one thing to have named account model that would be incomplete if you didn't have the product to go along with it. And that's where the bundled offerings, TC - Trimble Construction One, namely arms those account executives with the ability to offer customers a unique value proposition. And then what's behind that are the underlying processes and systems. So, we've had a lot of, I'd say, growth around our sales operations, our sales enablement motions. And then with the systems underneath, the work and the investment we've made over these last years has, let's say, upped our game in terms of licensing and entitlement engines as an example. Then we're getting more 360-degree views of our customers, which helps - all of which helps enable the sellers to go do what they do at that named account level.\nJonathan Hull: Got it. And then just in terms of a follow-up, can you give us a little bit more color on the Trimble Pay or payments opportunity and how that works from a contractual or financial perspective? Just want to understand, are these gross grosser net type contracts, and what that cross-sell opportunity maybe looks like through your base. Thank you.\nRob Painter: Yes. So, we're bullish on land and expand plays within the platform that we're offering. So, when we can attach new capabilities to the existing base of solutions and customers that we have, we think that's a winning motion. And we've seen that with the two acquisitions that both Phil and I mentioned in the prepared remarks about work in the field and as well as payments. It stands to reason that payments are going to link to an ERP, and guess what, we have the ERP through the Viewpoint business. So, that's the essential, let's call it value proposition or essential linkage. We also have the project management systems, the need to be able to pay subcontractors as a given in the industry with a natural place for us to be, and we think a winning motion. Phil, is there anything else you want to add to that?\nPhil Sawarynski: No, that was pretty good. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Rob Mason of Baird. Your line is open.\nRob Mason: Yes. morning Rob, and Phil. I wanted to see if I could get a little more color just what you're seeing across your various geographic regions, and if anything changed in the regions during the quarter. Your overall outlook, revenue outlook, we can see what that is. It didn't have a lot of movement. I'm just curious though how you're seeing the second half of the year as well in some of the regions.\nRob Painter: Yes, we're seeing the most strength in North America. Actually, Europe grew on an organic basis. That's going to be from the Transporeon business. Ex-Transporeon, it's been a tougher market in Europe, but I\u2019d just say, it\u2019s still holding up on a baseline. Differentially, around the world, Asia Pacific was hardest for us in the quarter, and I'd say think of a couple of places. China continues to be a harder place for us to do business. In Japan, the weakness of the yen makes it more expensive to do business with us, and those have been sort of a couple if pockets of weakness. We're paying attention to what's happening in Australia, New Zealand, the state of the economy there. So, the Asia Pacific, weaker. North America, the strongest. Those are the bookends. And that plays into our thinking in the second half of the year.\nRob Mason: Very good. Rob, you made note of some of the automotive OEM wins. We hadn't talked about that part of the business in a bit. I know historically there was some involvement with GM. Could you bring us up to date on where your book of business sits overall in that positioning part of the business, and how many OEMs are you working with now?\nRob Painter: Yes, good question, Rob. So, let's talk about the underlying technology itself. I mean, you go back for our 47-plus year history, started in positioning technologies. As positioning technologies have continued to evolve and innovate continuously over the years, we moved from, or we got into what's called RTK positioning decades ago, and now we can deliver those same - which deliver corrections to create that highly accurate ubiquitous fast convergence for that high accuracy need, which historically had been for us in agriculture, survey, construction markets. We can now deliver those through satellite, so you get more global ubiquity of the coverage of that. And then we asked ourselves the question of where else would this high convergence, high accuracy signals be of value? Automotive markets were a natural extension for us. So, same technology into a new market segment, whether that's for ADAS systems or on the path to autonomy or it's redundancy into other positioning technologies or sensors, I should say, on the cars. So, that's the context for it and for that market and extending the technology into the automotive market. And automotive is a market that we had - we do have some history in through navigation technologies. Now, you mentioned General Motors\u2019 Super Cruise program. Yes, it's exactly the same topic that we're talking about with additional OEMs. I believe it's probably less than a dozen today that we have design wins with, and then there's certainly a pipeline that's bigger than that. When you think about the design win, it can take you a long time to get to that design win. Once you have the design win, you've got a pretty long lifecycle, actually, well, very - actually, I would say a very long lifecycle, multi-year call it plus or minus seven years over that design win. And if you kind of apply some software metrics to it and you think about the lens of lifetime value over customer acquisition costs, it's a good business to be in once you can win that OEM.\nRob Mason: If I could ask, how quickly do they convert to revenue? So, if your design wins in the quarter, when would you expect revenue?\nRob Painter: It's actually very slow to get to revenue. I mean, it's good news and bad news, bad news being it's very slow to get to being able to recognize that revenue. The good news is that we can recognize that revenue over a long period of time. So, I'd say to date over these last few years as we've been getting these design wins, it's had more cost associated with it than revenue and gross margins. So, it's been upside down for a few years. We're getting to a point of a cumulative base as we start to recognize that revenue. And it'll just - it will look better over the next few years as that cumulative base steps up, as it's the nature of the revenue recognition over multiple years. That 17% ARR growth in field systems has a little bit of that automotive segment, but that's not the fundamental thing yet that's growing it. And also, good news as I would say, that's the kind of visibility we can have years forward in field systems that we would've never had historically.\nRob Mason: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria: Hey, good morning. Thank you so much for taking the questions. So, the first question is on the transportation segment. I think the performance was quite impressive given the tougher compare year-over-year. So, when I look at the first half performance, it's up pretty nicely, 3% to 4% year-over-year. So, your guide implies a zero - flat to low single-digit growth for the full year. So, which means sequentially you're expecting some slowdown. Should we think about this sequential slowdown in terms of the tougher year-over-year third quarter comp, or are you expecting any softening in the demand? So, just trying to understand how to think about the back half versus first half for the transportation and logistics segment.\nPhil Sawarynski: Hey, Tammy, it's Phil. Thanks for the question. So, I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, but the - we've had some churn that we've already talked about in the North American mobility business, and that really starts to manifest itself in the second half. So, a big portion of the second half drop that you see is really due to that. But as Rob said earlier, we're still seeing the performance around the Transporeon business, the maps business that's offsetting some of that, but that's really the headwind that you see in the second half is that churn that we previously disclosed.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Thanks for the clarification. And then the other question is, I think you spoke of some incremental investments you're making in sales and marketing to support the software-centric businesses. Any updates on where you are in that process? Is it mostly done, or do you expect it to continue through the rest of the year? And more importantly, should we expect this to continue through next year as well? So, any color on that investment journey would be helpful.\nPhil Sawarynski: Yes. Hey, Tammy, it's Phil again. So, yes, so as we talked about this from a capital allocation standpoint, we continue to pivot our resources toward the AECO business, and in particular that sales and marketing, which ultimately drives the ARR growth and the revenue growth in the future. And so, we see that continuing as long as we have the pipeline and the bookings. And the nice thing about rule of 40 plus business there is if we do see slowdowns, we can easily pivot our OpEx and still maintain a rule of 40. But as long as we continue to see the growth and the opportunities there in that business, I think you'll see us continue to allocate our resources toward that.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take the final question from the line of Joshua Tilton of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nArsenije Matovic: Hi, this is Arseni on for Josh. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk directly, maybe a layer deeper into what you're seeing from a demand perspective across the AECO portfolio. Certain competitors in this space are facing challenges, and appears with one third new logo contribution to growth, this isn't really impacting your business. I know you sell a wide suite of products to different stakeholders, but are you seeing more demand than you saw starting this year, and is that driven by changing behavior in your existing customers, or are you seeing improving win rates versus competitors? And then just on Transporeon, with I think spot rates improving quarter-over-quarter in Europe and the Transporeon business getting more revenue per load in spot versus contract, is this providing a tailwind into full-year? And if so, is that embedded in your guidance release? Thank you.\nRob Painter: Hey, good morning, and thanks for the questions. I'll start with - this is Robert. I'll start with the AECO topic. So, yes, we have talked about the ARR growth, the two-third, one-third split coming from cross-sell versus the new logo. I think the additional color I can add to your question is as follows. We spend a lot of time segmenting the market, whether that's on the - I\u2019ll call it the end markets, it could be residential, non-residential, infrastructure. It's also on the customer types. We think about where we serve the architects and designers, the engineers, the construction companies and the owners, their segmentation there. There's also a level of segmentation in terms of the size of the customer. So, think about mid-market customers, think about large enterprise customers, and then lower down, think about the small medium-sized businesses. One of the areas where we've been able to pivot is where we've seen a little bit more weakness on the mid-size customers. We pivoted our motions and our teams into the small and medium-sized business market here in North America. So, we've got the data and the ability and the products and the go-to-market model aligned to go find the business where it is. And I think that's one of the things that's differential about us. So, we have a broader product offering, serving the broader ecosystem, serving more participants in that, serving it more globally than our peers in the industry, and then being able to move our motions up or down market depending on where more of the activity is taking place. We also have a channel. We've had a channel at Trimble, I mean, Trimble's history. We've got decades of managing Trimbles. If we look in the AECO business, probably 10% to 15% of our bookings in the quarter came through our channel. So, that's also a motion that we've had for a long time. Oh, and on the Transporeon side, you asked about spot rates in Europe. They are, I would say just marginally better. They're not better enough to be really moving the needle yet. But you're right to look at that. We do as well, and we'll continue to pay attention to that. So, we believe that the current rates are built into our guide. If the market were to move quicker and spot rates go up, then that would be upside for us.\nArsenije Matovic: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rob Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website, and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons, which refer to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. In addition, our P&L commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis, which excludes our agriculture business. Let's start on Slide 4. During the second quarter, we continued to advance our connect and scale strategy, which involves digitally connecting the workflows within targeted industry segments and creating scale across Trimble through shared technology platforms. Our strategy delivers outcomes in the form of unique value to our customers and sustainable value creation to our shareholders. We want to convey three key messages today; the strategy is working, the numbers reflect the execution, and the execution reflects our simplified and focused organization. Slides 5 and 6 detail some highlight metrics. $2.11 billion of ARR grew 14%. Revenue grew 1%. Gross margins were a record 66.5%. EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 24.6%, and free cash flow was strong. Revenue in the quarter was 75% software services recurring, and 60% overall recurring revenue, both records for Trimble, reflecting our portfolio transformation and continued organic mix shift driven by ARR growth. Based on the solid first half year performance, we are raising our guidance for the year. Before we turn to the performance of the segments, let me provide an update on the status of our financial audit. By way of reminder, the need for EY's re-audit over 2023 financials stems from concerns about the comprehensiveness and documentation of a number of our internal controls, especially around our IT systems. These concerns arose as EY prepared for a PCAOB inspection of their audit of Trimble. In April, EY began additional audit procedures relating to our 2023 financial statements using a more detailed substantive approach. We are working collaboratively with EY, and provided them with the substantial majority of the information they need. EY's work is nearing completion and we expect it to wrap up within the next month or so. To date, the audit has not identified any issues which would result in a change of our financial statements. When EY's work is complete, we will reissue our annual report for 2023 and file Forms 10-Q for the first and second quarter of 2024. Based on the work to date, we anticipate that the financial results will be the same as what we have previously reported. Let's get back to the business with a review of our segment results, starting on slide seven with our AECO segment. The team delivered another record quarter of ARR, with a terrific 18% level of ARR growth. The AECO segment is the tip of the spear of our connect and scale strategy, and the strategy is working. We are succeeding in growing customer count with our innovative products and driving higher revenue per customer through our integrated platform offering. The A represents architecture and design. Here, our SketchUp product surpassed 1 million subscribers, an amazing milestone delivered by the team. The E represents engineering. An example of the strategy at work here comes in the form of unique workflows that only Trimble can deliver, such as scan, BIM, and fabrication workflows. The C represents construction. Here, our recent tuck-in acquisitions of field and payment solutions have shown us that we can run repeatable land and expand plays that deliver our customers fast time to value when they buy additional capabilities on top of our construction management system. The O represents the owners, both private and public sector. In May, we held a user conference in Cleveland where we launched Trimble Unity, a suite of asset lifecycle management solutions that uniquely connect Trimble capabilities. Across these AECO personas, we operate a common and connected data environment, namely Trimble Connect. Connect has now initiated more than 20 million projects since inception, and had over 6 billion API hits into the platform in just the first six months of 2024. On the go-to-market side, we moved the team to a named account selling model earlier this year, and we are now lining up our digital marketing efforts to better enable our sales motions. In conclusion, the connect and scale investments we have made over the last several years have enabled us to grow and gain share. Our strategy resonates with customers looking for strong ROIs. Based on our second quarter results, our pipeline, and our solid bookings performance, we see our momentum continuing. We recently hired a Chief Revenue Officer for this business, which we believe will help further enable and ensure our growth and success at scale in this $1.16 billion ARR business that is already operating well above a rule of 40 benchmark. The physical side of our business is largely conveyed in our field systems reporting segment, with key highlights on Slide 8. Revenue was down as expected, primarily related to the strength of prior year government-related sales. While in-market conditions have been soft in some areas, we continue to perform well, with strong product and channel positions. Nowhere is this more evident than in the more than $300 million of field systems ARR. The team has been doing a great job of converting relevant software and hardware models, where we have the ability to leverage our strong market position and product offerings to deliver unique value to customers. This motion has expanded our addressable market, as evidenced by delivering 17% ARR growth, nearly matching the growth in AECO. I'll illustrate this through three examples, starting with our Works Plus offering in civil construction, which offers machine control and guidance as a service. The team delivered a record quarter of bookings. Second, our Positioning Services business has expanded our unique ability to offer globally ubiquitous and high accuracy signals from our classic geospatial and agriculture markets into automotive markets. The team delivered three design wins in the quarter to major automotive OEMs. And third, we launched the R980 GNSS survey instrument in the quarter, with firmware configurations, field software, and Positioning Services available on a subscription basis, which expands the addressable market by lowering upfront costs, enabling more customers to adopt our premium solutions. Strategically speaking, most of the solutions we sell in this segment act as a data collection node in the physical world to provide us the unique Trimble ability to connect to the physical and digital world. Closing our segment commentary on Slide 9, transportation and logistics beat our top and bottom-line expectations. Transporeon delivered double-digit ARR growth, as did our maps business. Excluding the North America mobility business, organic ARR growth in this segment was 11%. While our mobility business has experienced the churn we anticipated, it is worth noting that the team delivered the largest bookings in the last few years in the quarter, which was one half a technology upgrade with Trimble, and one half a competitive displacement. Our new Instinct platform is generating positive buzz in the market, and we are having good success selling video solutions. While the freight market remains in a recessionary environment, our Transporeon business continued to win new logos in the quarter, and we continue to innovate on all our solutions, some of which will be unveiled at our user conferences in September. In addition, we are moving down the path of product rationalization between the Trimble and Transporeon businesses, as evidenced by consolidating our work on freight marketplace and visibility and to one team each. We also began selling our mapping solutions into the Transporeon customer base. The sum of these activities delivered 18.7% operating income, a solid 460 basis point increase. Before handing over to Phil to walk us through more of the numbers, I wanted to offer a perspective on why we see Trimble as an AI winner. Starting with our own internal usage, we now have over 2,500 engineers using GitHub Copilot and more than 5,000 Trimble colleagues using an internal version of Microsoft Azure OpenAI that we call Trimble Assistant. From a customer-facing perspective, we have beta and production releases of AI capabilities in a number of areas. In AECO, we automate the extraction of PDF data into submittal logs and into estimating engines. We also transform 3D BIM models into photorealistic renderings. In field systems, we focus on feature extraction from 3D point clouds. In transportation, our AI solutions include customer support, autonomous procurement, and autonomous quotation systems that match shippers with carriers. We've included several examples of Trimble AI in the appendix of the slides, complete with hyperlinks. Our thesis on AI is that the density of domain-specific data and insight will separate the AI winners and losers. With our unique scale that includes over $1 trillion of construction capital programs, tens of billions of dollars of freight transactions running through our systems, millions of global customers, and hundreds of thousands of instruments and machines in the physical world, we believe we have a compelling right to win and a defensible moat to continue building around our business. Phil? Thanks, Phil, and thank you to all our Trimble colleagues and partners for delivering a solid first half of the year and for demonstrating resilience and conviction as we continue to transform how we work so that we can transform how the world works. I'll end with a fun fact related to the games in Paris. Our technology was leveraged for the design, engineering, and construction of many of the stadiums, such as the aquatic center, the sailing marina, the football stadium, and also for athletic housing. The Les Gradins building, which houses over 400 athletes, will be converted to an office building after the games conclude. On the project, our survey kit, engineering, and prefabrication technologies, were used to construct a sustainable structure and to deliver it on time. Trimble Connect was used as a collaboration platform to coordinate across hundreds of users and stakeholders. To quote the BIM engineering manager on the project, I find Trimble Connect to be the best collaboration platform on the market in terms of file quality and usability. You can tell they designed the tool to be easy to use, even for non-experts. Operator, let's open the line to questions. Thanks, Kristen, for the question and good morning. So, let's break down a little bit there within the ARR growth, starting with a congrats to the team. It really was a terrific post of a number for the quarter. About two thirds of that growth is coming from existing customers and one third from new logos. And so, we really - for the breadth and depth of the portfolio we have, there's a great ability for us to package cross-sell, upsell, and that comes in the form of the Trimble Construction One offering where we now have over 20 pre-packaged offerings to serve specific personas across the industry continuum. If we look at the segments that we're serving within construction, where we see strong growth are in data centers. We see the onshoring and reshoring of renewable energy work. These end markets have been strong, and private data centers have been the strongest. We actually have also had some growth in residential. So, even though there's weakness there, we've seen growth there. One thing that's unique too, Kristen, about the data set that we have, because we're managing over $1 trillion of committed construction programs through our systems, over $0.5 trillion through the ERP alone, is there's a lot of data we can see. And so, in North America, we can see that jobs are up. Hiring's up. That is jobs are up. We can see that the volumes are up. We can see geographic strengths within States here in the US. We can see that States like South Carolina, Florida, Texas, have been very strong. We can see states like New York and Louisiana have been weaker. So, we're able to get a good insight into the market. And then differentially across the world, North America for sure is performing better than Europe and Asia Pacific. So, hope that gives you some color. Yes, it's a great question, Kristen. We're still in the very early innings of monetization. We're paying a lot of attention to it. Now, you talked about the GitHub Copilot work. That's internal productivity. So, the lens I have on this is, there's a set of work in AI that's for making us more efficient and productive inside our own house. That could be how we're doing customer support using the chat bots. It is the productivity through the code development. It's getting sharper about how we do our marketing efforts, leveraging AI when we go more customer-oriented, and those are the examples I had in the prepared remarks, and then we put a slide in the appendix with some hyperlinks so you can go look at some examples of what we're doing in the market. I'd give you sort of two breakdowns on that. One is that we see it as - some of this is part of continuous value delivery to our customers. That is, they're paying subscriptions. We typically get price increases every year. I think there's a reasonable expectation that we're providing incremental value. And in that sense, it's part of the offering that we do. The distinction I would make is when we have more breakthrough productivity or breakthrough value that we can provide customers, we think about, okay, what's the - quantifying that value and then what's our fair share of that capture? One example I can point out is in - within our Transporeon business, is the team has developed autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation capabilities. And when customers are using that instead of the traditional methods they've used and solutions they've used within Transporeon, we're monetizing that at I think of 2x to 3x (indiscernible) to 2x factor for execution because the result is that much better for the customers. So, that's one example of where we're monetizing, and I'd say we're still pretty early in it. And you're right that this is certainly evolving in the monetization side of things. Hey, thanks for the question. Relative to the election, I mean, you typically hear that in these periods, that people will do a bit of a pause to kind of see which way the wind's going to blow, and we'll see which way the wind blows. We believe we've taken that into account in the guide that we've put forward. And if you think about the guide, think about the visibility we have with the ARR business is much higher than we would have on let's say the hardware business, which manifests more as a book-and-burn. So, we have visibility into the rest of the year, differential visibility. 60% of our revenue is now recurring as a company. 75% of our revenue overall is software services and recurring. It's certainly reasonable for us to - and all of us, I guess, to think about what the impact of the election might be on our business, whether that's around regulation or whether that's around tariffs, depending on which way this goes. But we believe we've got this taken into account. Sure. Hey, let me frame this in two ways, one with the first half of the year, and then secondarily with the second quarter specifically. For the first half of the year, the bookings growth in the Transporeon business was in the mid to high teens. So, super pleased with that performance in context of what still is a freight recession. And so, the way then you can grow that bookings is coming through winning deals. And in the second quarter, the team won over 250 deals. Those deals come in the form of landing dozens of new logos and also doing land and expand plays within the existing customer base. There are certainly some pockets of end markets that are stronger and others that are weaker. There's been some strength coming back on the retail side. Some of the building materials have - that side of the business has been lower for the business. The team also had some success getting traction here in north America as well, which we were pleased by. And then last thing I'll comment on is we've got more plays happening between the Transporeon and Trimble Transportation business. Still early in that, but I like what I'm seeing in terms of the teams working together. So, add that up and that's the color around the numbers. Sure, Jerry. So, the growth is about two thirds from existing customers and one third from new logo customers. And you're right, the team has consistently been posting excellent growth. And this is excellent growth at scale. I mean, AECO alone is a $1.16 billion ARR business today, growing ARR in the high teens, operating at a rule of 44 in the quarter. It was over rule of 50 in the first quarter. Net retention is about 108% in the business. So, a lot of good things happening in the business. We believe we're winning because we have a unique value proposition. The value proposition is delivering productivity, quality, safety, environmental sustainability to our customers. It's helping them solve higher order problems for customers and ability, especially when we have the TC - where we have the TC One offerings available. That's Trimble Construction One. It reduces friction in the buying process. It makes it easier for customers to do business with us. It's doing things with Trimble that you can uniquely do, that is connecting work in the field and work in the office. So, when we look at the base of the customers that we have, we're bullish in our ability to continue growing this business, especially when I look at that two-third, one-third split, and two thirds being from existing customers. Hi. Good morning, Jonathan. So, yes, we moved - in the AECO business, we moved to a named account selling model at the beginning of the year. It was definitely a huge change for the team and for the organization. And if you think about it, if you're going to - if you sort of rewind, call it five, 10 years ago, we might have sent multiple sellers in to talk to a given customer. Today, that moves to having one person who's got accountability for that account, and then accountability to bring in the specialist behind her or him in order to best serve that customer and meet the breadth of needs. Now, it's one thing to have named account model that would be incomplete if you didn't have the product to go along with it. And that's where the bundled offerings, TC - Trimble Construction One, namely arms those account executives with the ability to offer customers a unique value proposition. And then what's behind that are the underlying processes and systems. So, we've had a lot of, I'd say, growth around our sales operations, our sales enablement motions. And then with the systems underneath, the work and the investment we've made over these last years has, let's say, upped our game in terms of licensing and entitlement engines as an example. Then we're getting more 360-degree views of our customers, which helps - all of which helps enable the sellers to go do what they do at that named account level. Yes. So, we're bullish on land and expand plays within the platform that we're offering. So, when we can attach new capabilities to the existing base of solutions and customers that we have, we think that's a winning motion. And we've seen that with the two acquisitions that both Phil and I mentioned in the prepared remarks about work in the field and as well as payments. It stands to reason that payments are going to link to an ERP, and guess what, we have the ERP through the Viewpoint business. So, that's the essential, let's call it value proposition or essential linkage. We also have the project management systems, the need to be able to pay subcontractors as a given in the industry with a natural place for us to be, and we think a winning motion. Phil, is there anything else you want to add to that? Yes, we're seeing the most strength in North America. Actually, Europe grew on an organic basis. That's going to be from the Transporeon business. Ex-Transporeon, it's been a tougher market in Europe, but I'd just say, it's still holding up on a baseline. Differentially, around the world, Asia Pacific was hardest for us in the quarter, and I'd say think of a couple of places. China continues to be a harder place for us to do business. In Japan, the weakness of the yen makes it more expensive to do business with us, and those have been sort of a couple if pockets of weakness. We're paying attention to what's happening in Australia, New Zealand, the state of the economy there. So, the Asia Pacific, weaker. North America, the strongest. Those are the bookends. And that plays into our thinking in the second half of the year. Yes, good question, Rob. So, let's talk about the underlying technology itself. I mean, you go back for our 47-plus year history, started in positioning technologies. As positioning technologies have continued to evolve and innovate continuously over the years, we moved from, or we got into what's called RTK positioning decades ago, and now we can deliver those same - which deliver corrections to create that highly accurate ubiquitous fast convergence for that high accuracy need, which historically had been for us in agriculture, survey, construction markets. We can now deliver those through satellite, so you get more global ubiquity of the coverage of that. And then we asked ourselves the question of where else would this high convergence, high accuracy signals be of value? Automotive markets were a natural extension for us. So, same technology into a new market segment, whether that's for ADAS systems or on the path to autonomy or it's redundancy into other positioning technologies or sensors, I should say, on the cars. So, that's the context for it and for that market and extending the technology into the automotive market. And automotive is a market that we had - we do have some history in through navigation technologies. Now, you mentioned General Motors' Super Cruise program. Yes, it's exactly the same topic that we're talking about with additional OEMs. I believe it's probably less than a dozen today that we have design wins with, and then there's certainly a pipeline that's bigger than that. When you think about the design win, it can take you a long time to get to that design win. Once you have the design win, you've got a pretty long lifecycle, actually, well, very - actually, I would say a very long lifecycle, multi-year call it plus or minus seven years over that design win. And if you kind of apply some software metrics to it and you think about the lens of lifetime value over customer acquisition costs, it's a good business to be in once you can win that OEM. It's actually very slow to get to revenue. I mean, it's good news and bad news, bad news being it's very slow to get to being able to recognize that revenue. The good news is that we can recognize that revenue over a long period of time. So, I'd say to date over these last few years as we've been getting these design wins, it's had more cost associated with it than revenue and gross margins. So, it's been upside down for a few years. We're getting to a point of a cumulative base as we start to recognize that revenue. And it'll just - it will look better over the next few years as that cumulative base steps up, as it's the nature of the revenue recognition over multiple years. That 17% ARR growth in field systems has a little bit of that automotive segment, but that's not the fundamental thing yet that's growing it. And also, good news as I would say, that's the kind of visibility we can have years forward in field systems that we would've never had historically. Hey, good morning, and thanks for the questions. I'll start with - this is Robert. I'll start with the AECO topic. So, yes, we have talked about the ARR growth, the two-third, one-third split coming from cross-sell versus the new logo. I think the additional color I can add to your question is as follows. We spend a lot of time segmenting the market, whether that's on the - I'll call it the end markets, it could be residential, non-residential, infrastructure. It's also on the customer types. We think about where we serve the architects and designers, the engineers, the construction companies and the owners, their segmentation there. There's also a level of segmentation in terms of the size of the customer. So, think about mid-market customers, think about large enterprise customers, and then lower down, think about the small medium-sized businesses. One of the areas where we've been able to pivot is where we've seen a little bit more weakness on the mid-size customers. We pivoted our motions and our teams into the small and medium-sized business market here in North America. So, we've got the data and the ability and the products and the go-to-market model aligned to go find the business where it is. And I think that's one of the things that's differential about us. So, we have a broader product offering, serving the broader ecosystem, serving more participants in that, serving it more globally than our peers in the industry, and then being able to move our motions up or down market depending on where more of the activity is taking place. We also have a channel. We've had a channel at Trimble, I mean, Trimble's history. We've got decades of managing Trimbles. If we look in the AECO business, probably 10% to 15% of our bookings in the quarter came through our channel. So, that's also a motion that we've had for a long time. Oh, and on the Transporeon side, you asked about spot rates in Europe. They are, I would say just marginally better. They're not better enough to be really moving the needle yet. But you're right to look at that. We do as well, and we'll continue to pay attention to that. So, we believe that the current rates are built into our guide. If the market were to move quicker and spot rates go up, then that would be upside for us."

            "name": "Phil Sawarynski",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. As noted before, my financial commentary will emphasize comparables on an as-adjusted basis, which excludes our agriculture business. We believe that maximizing long-term free cash flow drives shareholder value. Connect and scale is our strategy, which we believe will continue to deliver recurring revenue growth, margin expansion, and ultimately cumulative cash flow growth. Slide 10 highlights balance sheet and cash flow dynamics. On cash flow, we are trending better than expected after considering the transaction-related impacts. Reported free cash flow in the first half of 2024 was $300 million, that includes $50 million of tax payments related to our gain on sale from the AG JV, as well as $54 million in M&A-related transaction expenses. Our conversion ratio in the first half of 2024 without these items was well above our target of 1x net income. We'll have additional tax payments impacting future operating cash flow related to the AG JV gain on sale in our third and fourth quarters of 2024 and second quarter of 2025, since the tax payments are spread out over time. Our asset-light model continues, with capital expenditures less than 2% of revenue and negative net working capital. Net debt to EBITDA after the close of the AG JV stands at less than 1x, well below our long-term leverage target of 2.5x. We have just under $1 billion in cash after paying down our term debt and the outstanding balances on our credit facilities. We intend to resume our share buyback when practical. Our capital allocation focus remains the same. We invest where we see opportunities for the highest returns. We continue to disproportionately allocate capital to our AECO business where the bulk of our operating expense increases are in our sales and marketing engines to continue to drive ARR, revenue growth, and ultimately margin expansion. On the M&A front, we expect to opportunistically pursue tuck-in acquisitions primarily in the AECO segment where we can quickly integrate and bundle within Trimble Construction One. We acquired a field human resources application in the third quarter of 2023, and we also recently acquired a payments offering branded as Trimble Pay that has been integrated with Viewpoint, and for both, we are seeing bookings well in excess of our deal models. These growth opportunities are enabled by our connect and scale strategy via bundled product offerings that we put in the hands of our sellers. This is a playbook that is delivering results and is a critical part of our acquisition strategy going forward. With that, let's turn to Slide 11 and talk about guidance for the remainder of the year. We have a 53rd week in fiscal 2024, which adds approximately $85 million of revenue and $50 million of operating income, mainly driven by term license renewals on January 1st, which falls in the fourth quarter of this year. We are increasing the midpoint of our as-reported full-year revenue guidance by $10 million from $3.62 billion to $3.63 billion, which also overcomes foreign currency headwinds. We are also increasing the full year earnings per share midpoint by $0.04 to $2.74 from the prior $2.70. AECO revenue is slightly better than our prior guide due to the first half performance and strong bookings in the prior quarters. Field systems revenue is down slightly, and transportation is unchanged. We maintain our strong ARR growth range from 11% to 13%, driven primarily by the expectation of mid to high teens growth in AECO, offset largely by the previously disclosed churn in our North American transportation mobility business. Our EBITDA margin for the year is expected to be between 26.7% and 27.2%. Free cash flow conversion for the year is updated to be approximately 0.75x net income, which includes $116 million of anticipated tax on gain from the JV I noted earlier, as well as approximately $75 million in full-year M&A costs. Without these items, we would be above 1x net income for the year, and an improvement from our prior guide. Let's move to our third quarter guidance on Slide 12, which is consistent with our prior guide. I'll focus again on our as-adjusted view, excluding agriculture. Our outlook for ARR growth remains strong, with continued expectations for 11% to 13% organic growth despite the North American transportation mobility headwind I mentioned earlier. Our total company revenue is projected to be $840 million to $880 million. On an as-adjusted basis, our revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of flat to up 4% year-over-year, and is showing improvement relative to the second quarter, mainly due to strong government sales in the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%, and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 24% to 25% for the third quarter. Our EPS forecast is in the range of $0.58 to $0.64, which is, again, consistent with our prior guide. I would also like to point out that we included a new supplement in our materials that is available on our Investor Relations website. This is to provide a summary of our results, along with assumptions behind our guidance model in a readily available format. One more item I'd like to mention before turning it back over to Rob. As we think about the financial model in a multi-year context, I refer to our Investor Day numbers from September 2022. Our long-term target model projected that revenue would grow in the 5% to 8% range organically. Normalizing for the benefit of the extra week in fiscal year 2024, we believe with the continued shift to higher growth software, we are biased above the midpoint of this range. We also had forecasted operating leverage in the range of 30% to 35%. Given the mix shift to software with higher gross margins, we would expect operating leverage going forward to be at or above the high end of this range. Thus, we see the potential to expand operating margins in the range of 100 basis points or more annually. We look forward to providing more details and an update on our long range financial plan at our Investor Day in New York City on December 10th. Rob, I'll turn it back over to you. Yes, thanks, Zane. Hey, the main reason for really the mix shift is our AECO business, continues to grow at a faster rate of the - than the field systems. And we have a little bit better first half and those bookings start to flow through in the second half. And so, I think what you're seeing is then that mix shift, which obviously the gross margin on the AECO business is higher than the field systems. And so, you're seeing that sort of flow through in the back half of the year. No, that was pretty good. Thanks. Hey, Tammy, it's Phil. Thanks for the question. So, I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, but the - we've had some churn that we've already talked about in the North American mobility business, and that really starts to manifest itself in the second half. So, a big portion of the second half drop that you see is really due to that. But as Rob said earlier, we're still seeing the performance around the Transporeon business, the maps business that's offsetting some of that, but that's really the headwind that you see in the second half is that churn that we previously disclosed. Yes. Hey, Tammy, it's Phil again. So, yes, so as we talked about this from a capital allocation standpoint, we continue to pivot our resources toward the AECO business, and in particular that sales and marketing, which ultimately drives the ARR growth and the revenue growth in the future. And so, we see that continuing as long as we have the pipeline and the bookings. And the nice thing about rule of 40 plus business there is if we do see slowdowns, we can easily pivot our OpEx and still maintain a rule of 40. But as long as we continue to see the growth and the opportunities there in that business, I think you'll see us continue to allocate our resources toward that."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Krista and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Trimble First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Painter, President and Chief Executive Officer. Rob, you may begin your conference. \nRobert Painter: Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons which refer to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. In addition, our P&L commentary will primarily emphasize our as-adjusted numbers, which exclude our agriculture business, better reflecting Trimble on a go-forward basis.  \n Starting on Slide 4. During the first quarter, we continued to advance our Connect & Scale strategy, which involves digitally connecting workflows within targeted industry segments and creating scale across Trimble through shared technology platforms. Our strategy delivers outcomes in the form of unique value to our customers and sustainable value creation to our shareholders. We want to convey 3 key messages today, starting with a solid performance in the quarter, where all 3 segments performed ahead of expectations as detailed on Slides 5 and 6. $2.03 billion of ARR grew 13% organically, as-adjusted revenue grew 8% organically, as-adjusted gross margins were a record 67.5%, as-adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 290 basis points to 27.9% and free cash flow was strong at $227 million. We are confirming our previous total year guidance despite unfavorable currency moves and we will provide an update on our next call as we build confidence in the months ahead.  \n Key message #2 is a strategic portfolio highlight. In the first quarter, we divested certain water monitoring assets, our 21st divestiture in the last 4 years. And on April 1, we closed our PTx Trimble joint venture. I'm proud to have established this precision ag joint venture with Eric Hansotia and his team at AGCO. This is a high character team with a bold vision. These moves simplify and focus our organization and provide cash to strengthen our balance sheet and support our capital allocation strategy.  \n Key message #3 on Slide 7 is that our new reporting segments are in place, which align to our new organizational structure. We provided historical data on the segments to investors on April 12. It takes an enormous amount of work to affect change on this scale and I'm grateful to our Trimble colleagues for their courage and dedication. The sum of these actions will simplify and focus our business, thereby enabling us to reset to a new and better baseline as we aim to perform to our full potential. As evidenced on an as-reported basis, our first quarter revenue was 73% software, services and recurring and 58% recurring. While on an as-adjusted basis, our first quarter was 77% software, services and recurring and 63% recurring.  \n Turning to the segments. Let's start on Slide 8 with our AECO segment. Connect & Scale is well in motion here and it is working. Connect is about connecting users, data, stakeholders and workflow across the industry life cycle continuum. Our right to win starts with the breadth, depth and connectedness of our offerings. It bookends by delivering solutions that connect the physical and digital worlds. Scale is about making Trimble easier to do business with and enabling efficient and effective growth. In the quarter, we moved our go-to-market team to an account-based selling model. We expanded our prepackage to Trimble Construction One offerings and we released our next version of systems transformation, which is providing us new insights into our customers. \n Mark Schwartz and his team delivered record first quarter bookings, an 18% increase in ARR and margin expansion of 430 basis points. This business is a multiyear overnight success. And we trust the new reporting structure now gives enhanced visibility to the quality of the business we have been transforming over the last few years.  To emphasize the point, this is a scaled $1.1 billion ARR segment operating as a Rule of 40 plus business, in fact, a Rule of 50 plus in the quarter. Market conditions remain favorable at the moment with strength in subsegments such as reshoring and onshoring of manufacturing, EV and battery plants, data centers and renewable energy projects. The physical side of our business is largely conveyed in our new Field Systems reporting segment with key highlights on Slide 9.  \n This business is predominantly hardware but that discrete word underplays the importance of this business to our strategy. Think of this as industrial IoT, the data collection node in the physical world that provides us the ability to connect the physical and digital worlds. In this business, we are continuing to transform our selling models, moving towards hybrid models where we increasingly monetize aspects of the solution as recurring revenue. Thus, the segment revenue splits approximately 50-50 as hardware and software. On an as-adjusted basis, which excludes our agriculture business, Ron Bisio and his team grew revenue by 1%, while increasing operating margins by 250 basis points to 26.9%. Software, services and recurring revenue are 48% of business and ARR grew 14%, evidence of our Connect & Scale strategy in motion in this segment. \n Market conditions remain mixed and overall slightly positive. We see strength in the same subsegments as AECO, including infrastructure spend. On the cautious side, we see economic weakness in pockets of Europe and Asia Pacific, most notably through lower OEM retail unit sales and continued weakness in residential construction. We are closely monitoring U.S. GDP growth, along with global interest rate dynamics and how that will impact capital purchases.  \n Closing our segment commentary on Slide 10. Transportation and Logistics began the year with a solid start. We closed the Transporeon acquisition last April. Thus, it is excluded from the organic comparison in the first quarter. On the heels of record fourth quarter bookings, the Transporeon team delivered a record first quarter bookings. Chris Keating and his team reorganized their go-to-market strategy and recommitted to process excellence and organizational focus. They are also delivering innovation, most notably through AI-driven product releases in autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation, which have found product market fit. \n They predominantly deliver this bookings growth in a European region that continues to experience a freight recession, thus demonstrating that selling a winning value proposition and backing it up with innovation and process improvement can generate positive results even in a tough market environment. They also delivered a multi-hundred thousand dollar annualized contract value global cross-sell win, selling autonomous procurement to an existing enterprise software customer that is notably in North America. We've also begun cross-selling our map solutions into Transporeon's European customer base. We remain confident this is an exciting Trimble business with a compelling right to win and an attractive business model that enables a series of land and expand product-led growth opportunities.  \n In context of the bookings and ARR growth, we will continue to allocate capital to our go-to-market expansion. In the rest of the segment, the 4% organic revenue growth was driven by our Enterprise and Maps teams, which each grew double digit. Excluding Transporeon, we have delivered consistent margin expansion since the end of 2021. Including Transporeon the segment expanded margins by 480 basis points in the quarter.  \n Before I turn it over to Phil for his first call as our incoming CFO, let me once again express my gratitude to David Barnes for his service and partnership over these last few years. Phil, over to you. \nPhil Sawarynski: Thank you, Rob. We believe shareholder value is ultimately a function of maximizing long-term free cash flow. Connect & Scale is our engine, which in the mid to long term, aims to deliver cumulative recurring free cash flow.  \n Slide 11 highlights balance sheet and cash flow dynamics in the quarter. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter, coming in at $227 million or 1.4x non-GAAP net income. We continue our asset-light model with capital expenditures less than 1% of revenue and negative working capital. Pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA after the close of the agriculture joint venture stands at about 1. Post the close of the AGCO transaction, at the beginning of the second quarter, we have just under $1 billion in cash even after paying down our term debt and the outstanding balances on our credit facilities. Our strong cash balance puts us in a good position to resume our share buyback activity after we issue the 10-Q.  \n Now a few comments about capital allocation. Our priority remains the same, which is to invest back into our business where we see opportunities for the highest returns. For example, over the last few years, we have been investing in digital transformation, the fruits of which are being demonstrated in AECO. We continue to transform our processes and systems in AECO. And over time, we will expand this work throughout the rest of the company. As promised, we retired over $1 billion debt in early April. In January, we announced an $800 million share repurchase authorization. And in the first quarter, we executed $175 million of buybacks. \n On the merger and acquisition front, we will opportunistically pursue tuck-in acquisitions with a bias toward the AECO segment, where we can land and expand with capabilities that fit inside the Trimble Construction One offerings. As an example, we acquired [indiscernible] human resources application in the third quarter of 2023 and doubled the customer count in the first few months under our ownership. This was enabled by our Connect & Scale strategy via bundled product offerings that we put in the hands of our sellers. We intend to run the same playbook as we think about our acquisition strategy going forward.  \n Before I turn to guidance, an update on the expected timing of the release of our 10-Q filing. Our auditors, EY, informed us several weeks ago that the 2023 audit of Trimble was selected as part of the PCAOB's inspection of EY's work. During preparation for the PCAOB review, EY concluded that neither EY nor Trimble had sufficient documentation related to certain IT and other controls for revenue-related systems and processes. While EY had deemed Trimble's controls over revenue effective at the time of the 10-K filing, EY's subsequent internal review over the last few weeks has changed their conclusion. Unfortunately, the result is that our 10-Q filing will be delayed and we will need to amend our 10-K to revise the internal control disclosures after the completion of EY's additional audit procedures. We have decided to delay our annual shareholders meeting until EY has completed their work. It is first and foremost, important to note and emphasize that our auditors have not withdrawn their 2023 financial audit opinion. We are committed to working with our auditors to close this out in an expeditious manner. \n With that, let's turn to guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. As Rob noted earlier, we are reaffirming all elements of our initial guidance for 2024 despite negative currency moves with some puts and takes between quarters and with prudence, given that we are still early in the year and our global end market environments are dynamic. Several factors influence our outlook for the year. While we got off to a very strong start in the first quarter, some of our outperformance came from hardware and term license revenue in the first quarter that we previously anticipated would come in the second quarter or later in the year. With this dynamic in mind, we think the best way to understand our trends is by looking at the year through a lens of first half versus second half. \n Overall, our outlook for the first half remains consistent with what we shared with you a quarter ago. We expect that as-adjusted organic revenue growth in the second half of the year will be consistent with the first half after adjusting for the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter. \n Let's now move to our detailed guidance on Slide 12. I will focus again on our as-adjusted view, excluding agriculture. Please note that we have also included slides in the appendix to our presentation that provide more information on our segment and corporate assumptions. Our prior guidance assumed the agriculture joint venture we closed on April 1, which is exactly what happened. The as-adjusted view removes agriculture in the historical periods, which enables looking at the growth dynamics of our current portfolio in a consistent way. Our outlook for ARR growth remained strong with continued expectations for 11% to 13% organic growth for the year. This is driven primarily by the expectation of mid- to high-teens growth in AECO ARR. Our total company full year organic revenue growth outlook remains in the 4% to 7% range. This is driven by AECO growth in the high teens to low 20s, field systems growth flat to down in the low single digits transportation revenue flat to up in the low single digits. \n As a reminder, our 2024 fiscal year includes 53 weeks, which increases full year and fourth quarter revenue by approximately $85 million of which approximately $70 million is in the AECO segment. Excluding this extra week revenue growth in AECO, is expected to be up in the low to mid-teens. Our margin outlook for the year is also unchanged with non-GAAP operating margin expected to be in the range of 24% to 25% and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%. This represents year-over-year improvement on both measures of between 100 and 200 basis points. AECO margins are expected to be up approximately 300 basis points for the year and by about 50 basis points, excluding the extra week. This margin expansion reflects both the strong growth in our construction software businesses with high gross margins, while continuing to invest in support of future growth opportunities. \n In Field Systems, margins are expected to be down approximately 100 basis points due to changes in customer and product mix.  Finally, in transportation, we expect margins to continue to improve with margins up approximately 100 basis points for the year with continued margin expansion in our Enterprise, Maps and Transporeon businesses. \n Our EPS forecast of $2.60 to $2.80 is unchanged and continues to reflect the benefits of capital redeployment of the proceeds from the joint venture transaction. We've already paid down all of our prepayable debt and we continue to anticipate that we will execute on up to $800 million of share repurchases over the course of the year. Relative to our prior guidance, EPS will benefit from lower net interest expense due to the increased cash on our balance sheet, offset by lower equity income. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of approximately 0.85x non-GAAP net income. This outlook does not assume a change as it relates to expensing research and development for tax purposes. \n Excluding the impact of acquisition deal expenses and the 53rd week, our free cash flow forecast for the year is roughly 1x non-GAAP net income. Note that we expect free cash flow in the second quarter to be the lowest of the year. Second quarter cash flow is normally seasonally low and in the second quarter, we will see high acquisition-related expenses related to the closing and transition costs for the agriculture joint venture as well as higher cash taxes. \n I'll finish by offering a few comments on how our guidance for 2024 breaks out by quarter. As we discussed, our guidance overall assumes that excluding the 53rd week, our as-adjusted organic growth is relatively consistent between the first half and second half of the year. For the second quarter, we expect revenue between $845 million and $875 million, which reflects as-adjusted organic revenue approximately flat year-over-year. As-adjusted organic revenue growth year-over-year in all 3 segments is expected to be lower than the first quarter. In AECO, these dynamics reflect the timing of the term license sales which although considered as part of our ARR calculation, are recognized upfront under the accounting rules and positively impacted the segment in the first quarter. \n To illustrate this point further, within AECO, we recognized approximately $85 million of term license revenue in the first quarter and in both the second quarter and third quarter, we expect term license revenue in AECO to be approximately $30 million, due in large part to the normal timing of the term license renewals. Then in the fourth quarter, that term license revenue will increase again above first quarter levels due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in January 1, 2025, in our 2024 fiscal year, which is when many of the term licenses renew. Our ARR measure evens out the lumpy nature of term license revenue and we believe it is the best measure of growth in AECO. It's important to note that term license revenue is highly profitable, so the profitability in our AECO segment and at the company level will be highest in the first quarter and fourth quarter and lower in the second and third quarters. \n In the Field Systems segment, we had strong sales of geospatial technology to government customers in both the second quarter of 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, which we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. Transportation revenues and organic growth will be modestly lower in the second quarter, primarily reflecting reduced low-margin hardware sales in our North American mobility business. At this point, we expect the total company third quarter revenue will be similar to second quarter revenue with fourth quarter revenue, the high point for the year, assisted by $85 million in revenue from the 53rd week. Operating and EBITDA margins for the year are expected to follow these same trends. We look forward to providing you with more details on the drivers and economics of these segments at our Investor Day event in December. \n Rob, I'll turn it back to you. \nRobert Painter: Thanks, Phil. When we think about our right to win at Trimble, we believe we can uniquely bring together users and connect workflow between the physical and digital worlds across industry continuums. Connect & Scale as our strategy, our strategy as an industry platform strategy, our platform strategy is in turn a data strategy. If we are successful in our pursuits, we will collect one of the most complete data sets in and across industries, creating a flywheel of enhanced insights and data connectivity, thereby enabling our customers to transform how they work while building a competitive moat around our business. Thanks to all our Trimble colleagues for delivering a solid start to the year and for demonstrating resilience and conviction as we continue to transform how we work so that we can transform how the world works. \n Operator, we can now open the line to questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein. \nCharles Albert Dillard: So I guess my first question, I just wanted to dig in more into the financial controls issue. I was hoping if you could give a little bit more detail on just, I guess, like what happened in terms of the IT and the impact on revenue recognition. And then, I guess, to what extent, at least right now, do you think this could potentially impact the income statement? And just like how are you thinking about the timing of resolution? \nRobert Painter: I'm going to turn it to David Barnes. David is staying on with us to see this through to its conclusion. And so David, why don't you? \nDavid Barnes: Chad, so the process is that our 10-K was filed, as you know, in February and the PCAOB selected EY's audit of Trimble for their review. And as the EY team looked over their work papers on the internal control side of things, they concluded the documentation that they and we had would -- was not sufficient to meet the standards of the audit of internal controls. And Chad, the thing I'd point out is the EY support of our financials is unchanged. This is just about the internal controls. No issues with our numbers have been identified by EY or us. What's happening is, EY is going to go through enhanced audit procedures to confirm the numbers and then we will issue an amended 10-K which will enable us to issue the 10-Q as well. This -- we've looked at -- companies have gone through this and it takes probably more than 1 month, hard to predict the timing. It's inconvenient but we, at this point, have no reason to believe that our numbers will change and we're working cooperatively with EY to get through it. \nCharles Albert Dillard: Great. That's helpful. And just moving to AECO. Can you give a little bit more detail on bookings for that business, like during the quarter? And if you can, just talk about what the take rate is on your bundled offering? \nRobert Painter: So bookings in the quarter continued to be strong. So put together really a couple of years now of strong progression in the bookings. The bookings -- the ACV bookings were over 20% growth in the quarter. So we like what we're seeing in terms of the progression there. Within that, Trimble Construction One is clearly an offering that we've been talking a lot about over the last, say, 1 year, 1.5 years. The bookings grew faster than that within Trimble Construction One. So Trimble Construction One, we're continuing to increase the level of adoption through that as we've transformed our selling organization and the processes and the systems to go along with that. So I'll give you an example, in North America, I think about 80% of our bookings were Trimble Construction One bookings within the quarter and those grew at a level of almost 2x the bookings level growth on a year-over-year basis. So strong progression, Chad. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc. \nJason Celino: Maybe double clicking on that a little bit. When you think about the growth that you're seeing in AECO and maybe if you can go a step deeper on TC1? Is there a way to think about it versus net new versus expansion? \nRobert Painter: Jason, the breakdown on that is about 2/3, 1/3, 2/3 existing logos, 1/3 new logos. So if we take new logos, what we see is that the offering is expanding the addressable market. In some cases, that's allowing us to go, I'd say, more than the small, mid-sized end of the market with the offering. And then on the, let's call it, the mid- to upper end of the market, we continue to see customers wanting to buy into an ecosystem. We think that's driving a good amount of the growth. Team has done a great job executing. \nJason Celino: Yes. I mean it seems like you're executing quite well. I know the demand environment doesn't make it easy. But maybe relative to 90 days ago, maybe can you just give us an update on how some of that end market or macro kind of sentiment is within that segment? \nRobert Painter: Yes, good question. So on the macro side within AECO, what I would comment on, is that we see good growth in onshoring, reshoring of manufacturing, we see -- and you see that in Europe and North America. Renewables, data centers, these are strong growers in North America and those bookings and ARR growth supports that. Residential, with interest rate environment is on the other side of that. Trade, that aspect of the market is a bit more challenged. We actually also, Jason, have quite a bit of data within our own systems. As you know, we're managing nearly 1/3 of U.S. construction through our systems. And so we can see that hiring is up in the market here in North America in the nonresidential space. We can see geographically that there's been the largest growth in the Midwest, followed by the Southeast with Florida, Carolinas and Georgia. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. \nJonathan Ho: Just wanted to start with a little bit more of a high-level question. As we look at Trimble moving forward, just given the model and mix changes here, at what point should we expect ARR and total revenue growth to converge a little bit more? \nRobert Painter: Jonathan, it's Rob. Good question. We actually already see that in AECO. And so you can see the growth in the quarter, for example, was the 18% on the ARR as well as 18% revenue. If you look in transportation and logistics, you actually have the same phenomenon -- total revenue up for ARR up [ 4% ].  So it correlates to the amount of recurring, it's in that. The one that will be disconnected and would remain so for, I think, a number of years would be field systems, which is predominantly a hardware business. I think they recurring, as I recall it, in the 20% range on that. So those will remain separated and thus, leave a separation at the total company level. \nJonathan Ho: Got it. And just as a follow-up, can you give us a little bit more detail on Transporeon and what maybe changed there to drive the much improved results? \nRobert Painter: Yes, a good question as well. So another strong quarter of bookings growth. That's 2 quarters in a row of records for the business, a record Q4 and then a record with the Q1 as well. What I would say is, there's a few things to add on to that. So the team began successfully cross-selling Transporeon solutions to existing Trimble Transportation customers here in North America, which exemplifies go-to-market synergies and we think we're just getting started. Conversely, we've been selling some of our maps solutions into the European market. Those bookings growth were both with the shippers and carrier customers. \n And that's important because we continue -- the team is continuing to grow network participants on all sides of the transportation management platform, which effectively connects the buyers and the sellers of freight. Dozens of new logos were added in the quarter. I like what we're seeing from new products development as well with autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation. So I'd say a number of things coming together. The team is executing quite well in which is still a very difficult economic or difficult freight market economy, doubly so in Europe. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. \nJerry Revich: Yes, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the 2Q margin outlook. So you folks had an outstanding first quarter and I understand the comments about the term license sales but historically, you just don't have the type of margin step down that you're guiding to 2Q versus 1Q. And so I just want to make sure we understand how much of that is, making sure that we can beat numbers like we did this quarter versus a meaningful slowdown in any part of the business because, obviously, the performance in the quarter was really strong. \nPhil Sawarynski: Jerry, it's Phil. And thanks and good question because I know there's a lot of moving parts in our outlook. So, yes, if you think about Q1, as I talked about the term licenses, are largely a Q1 dynamic and that's that $50 million drop from Q1 to Q2. So if you look at the margin basis, I think it's around 400 -- a little bit more than a 400-point drop. So the large part of that, I'll put it into actually 4 buckets, half of that or a little over half of that is because of the dynamic of the term license. If you remember, as the term licenses actually get recognized all upfront. So that's high-margin revenue. And then as you move into Q2, the other 2 pieces are, one, we have our merit raises that take effect in April. And so that's about 100 basis points and then another 100 basis points is some additional OpEx primarily around the AECO business and the sales and marketing and R&D spend that we're -- we've talked about incremental spend there to continue to drive that growth engine. So -- and then the remainder is the term license to bridge that 400 points. \nJerry Revich: Okay. And then can I ask separately on the ARR, nice acceleration in performance in the quarter really across the segments. As we think about what the Transporeon rolling into the mix will look like and it feels like you're looking for an acceleration based on the outlook in Slide 15, across the segments, putting the pieces together across the whole company, could we see ARR accelerating on an organic basis in the mid- to high teens from an exit rate standpoint, beyond the full year guide. Just thinking about what 4Q might look like given the cadence that you described in the slides? \nRobert Painter: Well, so the Transporeon will certainly help them at the company level in terms of bringing up the ARR growth potential. The other side of that is the mobility business. And so the net of that gets to the guide that we put forward, Jerry. \nJerry Revich: And Rob, is it fair to say that there's an acceleration though 4Q above the full year ARR guide? \nRobert Painter: At this point, no. No, we're maintaining the outlook on that. It has -- I mean, it would buy us more than above to the mid but we're going to leave that guide where we are right now. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. \nKristen Owen: Rob, you called out the Rule of 40 balance for AECO. And I think just in this previous question had about 100 basis points going to reinvestment in that business. Just wondering if you can talk about sort of balancing that lifetime customer value versus your customer acquisition cost, how you think about investment versus growth to build out the opportunity set in that business? \nRobert Painter: Kristen, great question. Let me take that twofold. First, with the, call it, the 100 bps of investment -- OpEx investment into the AECO segment that Phil referenced. More than half of that is at the sales and marketing level. So that's putting feet on the street, sellers to go get the business that we think is there. About 1/4 of it is in R&D as we continue to drive connectivity and interoperability between the solutions driving workflow capabilities as well as AI investments we're making into the products. And then the remainder is in G&A, which is really the systems investments and the systems investments, which are enabling a lot of this to happen. \n So then at the level when we think about the return on investment that we're making to put into the business, we look at that lifetime value over the customer acquisition cost. And the easy heuristic is, when we're at a ratio above 3, that's telling us to and lean forward and invest into the business. We're well above that as of, call it, as a floor of our thinking. And so when we do that math, this is -- actually, it's a pretty straightforward exercise to say we should be leaning into investing in this business to go after the market, especially when we're delivering well above the Rule of 40, and in fact, above Rule of 50 in the [Audio Gap]. \nKristen Owen: Okay. That's helpful. When I think about the overall size of that market opportunity, I mean, we -- obviously, the business is going through a transformation at this point in time, TC1 really just starting to ramp. As we look at sort of the 5-year model for Trimble, how do you think about your mix of market opportunity for continuing growth in AECO. Is it within your existing customer base? Is it new products? Is it new logos? Just help us understand what sustains this growth on a go-forward basis? \nRobert Painter: Yes, it's a great question. So on a multiyear basis, I would frame this market as the largest available TAM that we have to service. We know the multitrillion dollar size of global construction. We're playing both in vertical construction, horizontal construction. We know it's a market that's large, global, underserved, underpenetrated, has challenges with productivity at the intersection of productivity and sustainability, which our solutions positively affect. We see more and more customers wanting to buy into ecosystems and our right to win, we think begins with the breadth and depth of solutions we have across the continuum of the life cycle. Furthermore, if you subscribe to a notion that the world is becoming more data-centric, more data-driven, then  you will like the touch points we have across this industry where we can, we believe, move from optimizing tasks to optimizing systems. \n So we think we're well and uniquely positioned to do so. With respect to how we then think about existing versus new logos. Within the existing customer base we have, we think that there's hundreds of millions of dollars of untapped ARR to mine through cross-sell and upsell, given the breadth of that installed base that we have. With the systems investments that we're making, it becomes more efficient to go to market. Some of those investments are creating -- starting to create the ability for customers to self-provision licenses, more e-commerce capabilities are starting to come to market. That, in turn, creates a more efficient go-to-market motion into the smaller end of the market. And so that, we think, would be another TAM that we can unlock through the nature of the business model and the efficiency of which we go to market. \n We for sure think that we can continue to win new logos along the way as customers and the market overall continues to adopt and continues to digitize. I would expect within that 5 years that the majority of that revenue would come through the existing base in this land and expand motion. So that's the expectation I'd want to set there. So continue to feel very, very positive about the work in this business and the progress that we're making and we'd like to think that we're just getting started. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. \nJustin Pellegrino: This is Justin Pellegrino on for Rob. I just wanted to look at the equipment side and what does a typical downside in the equipment side look like versus where we're at now? Are we most of the way into a normal downturn? Just any color there would be I think helpful. \nRobert Painter: Thanks for the question. Well, we certainly are following what the OEMs are reporting on their unit sales, both at a retail side and a wholesale demand level. And there's for sure a correlation within Field Systems business we have and the OEM. So we have OEM exposure let's say, in field systems that we really don't have nearly as much of in the other 2 segments of the business. What we would see through our own numbers is that the European economy is more challenged and we've seen some of the prints out there on units in, let's say, Europe, in construction, although interestingly enough, our Europe business in field systems performed quite well, relatively well in the first quarter. \n So it's not a perfect, let's say, R-squared on that correlation. We're also fundamentally architected to serve the aftermarket and to serve the mixed fleet within that. So there's also another, I'd say, call it, the mindset that we have is not to be driven by what are new unit sales, although we do obviously sell on to new units as we see many, many hundreds of thousands of millions of machines that would benefit from having Trimble technology on and machine types like excavators remain low single-digit penetrated with technology. \n And so we think there's enormous opportunities to drive technology adoption into the base of machines that are out there. That's just the civil construction side of the business. So in Field Systems, surveying and mapping is an important business for us and I would say we disconnect that from the unit sales coming out of the machinery manufacturers. And there, a surveyor fundamentally creates a digital model of the physical world, that work could be an oil and gas workflow, could be cadastral survey, could be in residential application. It could be in our national parks. There's a wide variety of applications in that market, which would be independent of machine units. I hope that helps provide some color. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason from Baird. \nRobert Mason: Rob, you noted the Transporeon business had a win in North America. And I'm just curious, if I think about when you bought the business, I'm not sure that was, the thesis there was heavily predicated on North America penetration. But now that you've owned it for about 1 year, I'm just curious how you're sizing up the opportunity to bring Transporeon, at least parts of Transporeon to North America and perhaps any comment on any commercial efforts you have around that as well? \nRobert Painter: Rob, thanks for the question. You're right about the original thesis of it is, we didn't, let's say, create our model fundamentally around bringing the European applications into North America. We saw that as additive opportunities and we for sure saw that we could do it. We just didn't predicate the deal on that being the fundamental thesis. So yes, hey, good news or that's the, the example, the customer I talked about in the prepared remarks, it's a multi-hundred thousand dollar ARR win that we have. And it actually is using the autonomous quotation product that we talked about earlier as well. So not even, let's say, the -- let's call it, the older or existing application capabilities we had in the business, it's actually a new one and so we find that very interesting to think about. \n What's most unique about what we have and special about the North America installed base, it's carrier-centric, is the nature of our customers. So when we look at capabilities to bring into North America on the carrier side, that would look like autonomous quotation and it's really creating automation around spot transactions. So that's something that makes sense for our sellers to be able to introduce to the existing customer base. In addition, we've talked before about Engage Lane in North America and the marketplace in Europe. We brought those organizations or those teams together into 1 team to create a global -- what's called global scale and global opportunity around that. So that's another example. And then the third example is real-time visibility. We're doing that as 1 business now, not separately in Europe and North America. And so that would -- those would be additional capabilities, then we want to penetrate here into the North America and yes. \nRobert Mason: Okay. Just as a follow-up. Again, as we get through this year, I guess we'll get recalibrated to the new -- the go-forward segments and the business without ag. But I was just curious in particular on the hardware and perpetual software gross margin trend. It's trended lower over the last 12 months. But my suspicion, ag had something to do with that. At 44% in the first quarter, how does that look on a go-forward basis without ag as we go through this year? \nRobert Painter: Yes, it's a good question, Rob, and Phil can chime in after I set this up. And you're right, there was an ag  [indiscernible] there in the numbers that you see. But in addition to that, we think about transitioning more of those hardware models into an element of recurring revenue. And that will naturally have a gross margin impact. So think about a system that might have sold for, let's call it, $40,000 system and that for us from a, I'll call it accounting perspective, has an element of hardware and software that's in that. And let's say that, that traditionally was splitting, we'd call it, $25,000 of hardware and $15,000 of software, so $40,000 sale. That might now convert to $25,000 and for the hardware upfront and a subscription of $5,000 a year. And in that case, that will have near-term headwinds to the gross margins. Now we're not flipping a switch and going 100% that direction, Rob. But you can see from the ARR growth that was 13% ARR growth in the first quarter, that it is a model that we are moving towards. So on a longer-term basis, that could be 200 to 300 basis points of a headwind. \n Phil, do you want to add anything to that? \nPhil Sawarynski: No, I think that's right, Rob. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Tilton with Wolfe Research. \nJoshua Tilton: Can you hear me? \nRobert Painter: Yes. \nJoshua Tilton: So just my first one is kind of a clarification. I appreciate all the color around the term impact to AECO. I guess what I'm trying to understand is because of 606  accounting, will there always be a term component in the AECO revenue line item each quarter, basically, every time you renew something or you can sign a new deal? And then my follow-up just as a clarification is, the reason why we have so much extra rev in the AECO segment because of the extra week because there's just a bunch of renewals that will have term licenses tied to those renewals that will land in the extra week of the year. Am I thinking about this correctly? \nPhil Sawarynski: Yes. Josh, it's Phil. So I'll answer -- your second question is the easy one. Yes, you are thinking about it correctly. Our 53rd week encompasses January 1, 2025 and a large portion of our term licenses renew around that date. And so you are correct in thinking that the 53rd week roughly $70 million of the $85 million there are the term licenses that renew. On your first question, yes, the -- there is an element of choice in this within AECO that we've had and we continue -- we'll continue to have that's largely in our structures business. And some of it has to do with the complexity and the horsepower around the offering itself where it's challenging to move that more into the cloud. So you will see that dynamic going forward, at least for the foreseeable future. \nJoshua Tilton: So just to be clear, term is not tied to all contracts in AECO, just some of them? \nPhil Sawarynski: Correct. It's a limited subset of the total AECO offerings. \nJoshua Tilton: Okay. Super helpful. And then I guess my follow-up on is just very high level. We've definitely had a lot of positive inbound since you guys have given this new segmentation. But I guess when you guys are sitting around the table right there, did anything change in terms of how you guys think about the business and plan about thinking about the business going forward that like aligns with this segmentation? Or is it kind of just business as usual for you guys there? And this segmentation is more for us investors better understand what's already been going on behind the scenes? \nRobert Painter: Josh, it's Rob. I'll take this one. I think it's a really good question. It's not just business as usual. It really does change how we're thinking about the business, how we're running it in some of -- at least the value creation opportunities that this unlocks. This does simplify and focus the company and I think provides a great new baseline for us as we move forward in executing the strategy. If we look at the AECO assets in that segment as an example, this is a business that is now operating at over $1 billion in ARR. It's a scaled ARR software business. This mandate in the business enables the team to take, let's say, the processes and the systems capabilities across a broader swath of the business than what we were doing previously. \n If I look within Field Systems, as an example, there, this is the first time in decades that we've had our survey business and our civil construction business under 1 leadership. That is providing a sharper focus and frankly, a level of accountability to sharing R&D capabilities, being more thoughtful about our positioning technologies and how we're using them across the business. It's driving better outcomes in terms of attaching things like our positioning services business to the hardware that we sell in survey and civil construction. And then super importantly, at a go-to-market level, the similar competency within this is selling, simply put, selling hardware through a global dealer channel. So we're bringing more efficiency in how we go to market. That is to say, we have 1 leader in Asia Pacific, 1 in the European region and 1 in the Americas. So 3 leaders from these regions overseeing the scope of what we do in survey and civil. Previously, that would have been 6 people instead of 3. \n So that, for us, is providing better and more consistent management at the dealers and then it enables a different way to think about capital allocation where we can put some of those resources and to help the dealers plan their long-term business health and their strategies to complement the work they're doing in the short term to help them identify the market opportunities and make the number. Transportation arguably had the least amount of change and there, it would feel probably a bit more like business as usual. \nJoshua Tilton: Super helpful. I guess just last one to kind of tie that all together. As investors, we see this change -- we see the change in the segmentation. You told us how it's -- it's definitely not business as usual. There are new and exciting things going on. Like what are we going to see in 12 months? Maybe 12 months is too soon, over the 3-year time frame, like what should investors be judging you on looking at you at, to say, this metric was this much better because of all the changes we made. Like where are we going to see all the positivity that you talked to come through in the numbers? \nRobert Painter: Yes. No, I like the question. And I used the words in the prepared remarks about a multiyear overnight success. This journey is 1,000 little steps. We launched Connect & Scale of January 2020. I think what we have now creates a new baseline. But let's also look at the facts in -- the fact base, I should say. In 2018, we had $1.1 billion of ARR. We closed Q1 at $2.03 billion of ARR. In 2018, we were 31% recurring revenue as a business, as-adjusted in Q1 were 63% ARR. We had EBITDA of 22.6% in 2018. We closed Q1 at 27.9%. Structurally, our gross margins in 2018 were 58% in Q1, adjusted to 67.5%. Over the last 5 years, we produced 44% operating leverage. \n We haven't just decided that this is the direction that we're going. We've been working on this for a number of years. So now as we take this as the baseline, I think one of the probably one of the better things that as an outcome of the resegmentation is that transparency and that visibility to the investment community, which is what you're highlighting. It is very obvious to see in that AECO business now. This is a scaled ARR business operating well above Rule of 40, growing ARR in the high teens, produced 37.4% operating income in the first quarter. I'm emphatically positive and proud of the team and what they've accomplished on that. \n So I look forward in the 3-year time frame, we're looking -- we talk about ARR and free cash flow. To me, those are the big bookends, not the only bookends but they're 2 of the biggest bookends that we have to drive value. So I'd say in the 3-year time frame, you should be looking for continued ARR growth. We should be able to continue to progress the structural gross margins, as software I would expect, would outgrow hardware over that time frame. The structural gross margin improvement is an enabler of an ability to drive operating leverage. We drive operating leverage, that means we're driving increased levels of EBITDA. And then as Phil said in his prepared remarks, I think cumulative free cash flow is the game in the long-term game. And so we'd be looking to continue to progress the free cash flow in the business relative to the net income that we have. That's the quantitative framework I'd have around that. Hope that helps. \nJoshua Tilton: It definitely did. Sounds fired up. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. \nTami Zakaria: So my -- I have a follow-up on the Transporeon comment. The autonomous port solution you sold to a North American customer, can the same salesperson currently selling the existing Trimble solution, sell the new Transporeon solution to the customer? Basically, I'm trying to understand how does the back end of all of this work in terms of the customer rep for each of the 2 solutions, the billing, et cetera. And then how did the ACV go up after selling this versus what it was before? \nRobert Painter: This is Rob. I'll take that one. So it was a -- it's a multi-hundred thousand dollar ARR, it's over $400,000 ARR in that example that I used, so therefore, the ACV is over the $400,000 -- yes, $400,000 as well. In terms of the go-to-market motion, it's the -- think of it as a named account seller who is responsible for the account in North America, bringing in a sales engineer or sales specialist from Transporeon, who knows the depth of the functionality to be able to, I'd say, be conversant with the customer and the value proposition and how to use it. And that's actually very similar, Tami, to Trimble Construction One when we're selling a breadth of offerings, we'll often have what we -- now we do have named account sellers. And then we can bring in the specialists -- technical specialist to really know the depth of a given solution to make sure that customer can get the most value out of that. Did that answer your question? \nTami Zakaria: Yes, it does. So the second question, after this formation of PTx Trimble, how do you view the organic growth algo potential of this new streamlined portfolio that you have? Basically, I'm curious to know whether you think it's now the right time to refresh the 2027 target. \nRobert Painter: Okay. So hey, on the -- what's the multiyear targets, we're going to have an Investor Day in December. And Phil mentioned that in his prepared remarks. I think we have been saying second half of the year but we're narrowing that to December. So that's the formal update. I appreciate that in the interim there will be questions of how do we think about that progression of the business and the model. And I think that we can continue to provide color in the next couple of calls. But what we already know is the baseline and I want to highlight that. We know we have a baseline from the quarter on -- or you can actually say, take the year, where we're guiding at the -- for the level of EBITDA for the company between 26.5% and 27.5%. We've talked about the ARR growth. They're guiding 11% to 13% organic. \n So if you apply the -- if you take the EBITDA that we have and you continue to play forward the growth we expect and apply operating leverage on that, it's not that hard to see that we could [Audio Gap] of gross margin improvement a year. [Audio Gap] And if that plays through, then you can get to a 2027 in a plus or minus frame and then we'll put the finer points and the details around that in -- sorry, in December for 2027 or wherever we decide to set the next multiyear mark. \nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. We believe shareholder value is ultimately a function of maximizing long-term free cash flow. Connect & Scale is our engine, which in the mid to long term, aims to deliver cumulative recurring free cash flow.  \n Slide 11 highlights balance sheet and cash flow dynamics in the quarter. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter, coming in at $227 million or 1.4x non-GAAP net income. We continue our asset-light model with capital expenditures less than 1% of revenue and negative working capital. Pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA after the close of the agriculture joint venture stands at about 1. Post the close of the AGCO transaction, at the beginning of the second quarter, we have just under $1 billion in cash even after paying down our term debt and the outstanding balances on our credit facilities. Our strong cash balance puts us in a good position to resume our share buyback activity after we issue the 10-Q.  \n Now a few comments about capital allocation. Our priority remains the same, which is to invest back into our business where we see opportunities for the highest returns. For example, over the last few years, we have been investing in digital transformation, the fruits of which are being demonstrated in AECO. We continue to transform our processes and systems in AECO. And over time, we will expand this work throughout the rest of the company. As promised, we retired over $1 billion debt in early April. In January, we announced an $800 million share repurchase authorization. And in the first quarter, we executed $175 million of buybacks. \n On the merger and acquisition front, we will opportunistically pursue tuck-in acquisitions with a bias toward the AECO segment, where we can land and expand with capabilities that fit inside the Trimble Construction One offerings. As an example, we acquired [indiscernible] human resources application in the third quarter of 2023 and doubled the customer count in the first few months under our ownership. This was enabled by our Connect & Scale strategy via bundled product offerings that we put in the hands of our sellers. We intend to run the same playbook as we think about our acquisition strategy going forward.  \n Before I turn to guidance, an update on the expected timing of the release of our 10-Q filing. Our auditors, EY, informed us several weeks ago that the 2023 audit of Trimble was selected as part of the PCAOB's inspection of EY's work. During preparation for the PCAOB review, EY concluded that neither EY nor Trimble had sufficient documentation related to certain IT and other controls for revenue-related systems and processes. While EY had deemed Trimble's controls over revenue effective at the time of the 10-K filing, EY's subsequent internal review over the last few weeks has changed their conclusion. Unfortunately, the result is that our 10-Q filing will be delayed and we will need to amend our 10-K to revise the internal control disclosures after the completion of EY's additional audit procedures. We have decided to delay our annual shareholders meeting until EY has completed their work. It is first and foremost, important to note and emphasize that our auditors have not withdrawn their 2023 financial audit opinion. We are committed to working with our auditors to close this out in an expeditious manner. \n With that, let's turn to guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of the year. As Rob noted earlier, we are reaffirming all elements of our initial guidance for 2024 despite negative currency moves with some puts and takes between quarters and with prudence, given that we are still early in the year and our global end market environments are dynamic. Several factors influence our outlook for the year. While we got off to a very strong start in the first quarter, some of our outperformance came from hardware and term license revenue in the first quarter that we previously anticipated would come in the second quarter or later in the year. With this dynamic in mind, we think the best way to understand our trends is by looking at the year through a lens of first half versus second half. \n Overall, our outlook for the first half remains consistent with what we shared with you a quarter ago. We expect that as-adjusted organic revenue growth in the second half of the year will be consistent with the first half after adjusting for the impact of the extra week in the fourth quarter. \n Let's now move to our detailed guidance on Slide 12. I will focus again on our as-adjusted view, excluding agriculture. Please note that we have also included slides in the appendix to our presentation that provide more information on our segment and corporate assumptions. Our prior guidance assumed the agriculture joint venture we closed on April 1, which is exactly what happened. The as-adjusted view removes agriculture in the historical periods, which enables looking at the growth dynamics of our current portfolio in a consistent way. Our outlook for ARR growth remained strong with continued expectations for 11% to 13% organic growth for the year. This is driven primarily by the expectation of mid- to high-teens growth in AECO ARR. Our total company full year organic revenue growth outlook remains in the 4% to 7% range. This is driven by AECO growth in the high teens to low 20s, field systems growth flat to down in the low single digits transportation revenue flat to up in the low single digits. \n As a reminder, our 2024 fiscal year includes 53 weeks, which increases full year and fourth quarter revenue by approximately $85 million of which approximately $70 million is in the AECO segment. Excluding this extra week revenue growth in AECO, is expected to be up in the low to mid-teens. Our margin outlook for the year is also unchanged with non-GAAP operating margin expected to be in the range of 24% to 25% and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%. This represents year-over-year improvement on both measures of between 100 and 200 basis points. AECO margins are expected to be up approximately 300 basis points for the year and by about 50 basis points, excluding the extra week. This margin expansion reflects both the strong growth in our construction software businesses with high gross margins, while continuing to invest in support of future growth opportunities. \n In Field Systems, margins are expected to be down approximately 100 basis points due to changes in customer and product mix.  Finally, in transportation, we expect margins to continue to improve with margins up approximately 100 basis points for the year with continued margin expansion in our Enterprise, Maps and Transporeon businesses. \n Our EPS forecast of $2.60 to $2.80 is unchanged and continues to reflect the benefits of capital redeployment of the proceeds from the joint venture transaction. We've already paid down all of our prepayable debt and we continue to anticipate that we will execute on up to $800 million of share repurchases over the course of the year. Relative to our prior guidance, EPS will benefit from lower net interest expense due to the increased cash on our balance sheet, offset by lower equity income. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full year free cash flow of approximately 0.85x non-GAAP net income. This outlook does not assume a change as it relates to expensing research and development for tax purposes. \n Excluding the impact of acquisition deal expenses and the 53rd week, our free cash flow forecast for the year is roughly 1x non-GAAP net income. Note that we expect free cash flow in the second quarter to be the lowest of the year. Second quarter cash flow is normally seasonally low and in the second quarter, we will see high acquisition-related expenses related to the closing and transition costs for the agriculture joint venture as well as higher cash taxes. \n I'll finish by offering a few comments on how our guidance for 2024 breaks out by quarter. As we discussed, our guidance overall assumes that excluding the 53rd week, our as-adjusted organic growth is relatively consistent between the first half and second half of the year. For the second quarter, we expect revenue between $845 million and $875 million, which reflects as-adjusted organic revenue approximately flat year-over-year. As-adjusted organic revenue growth year-over-year in all 3 segments is expected to be lower than the first quarter. In AECO, these dynamics reflect the timing of the term license sales which although considered as part of our ARR calculation, are recognized upfront under the accounting rules and positively impacted the segment in the first quarter. \n To illustrate this point further, within AECO, we recognized approximately $85 million of term license revenue in the first quarter and in both the second quarter and third quarter, we expect term license revenue in AECO to be approximately $30 million, due in large part to the normal timing of the term license renewals. Then in the fourth quarter, that term license revenue will increase again above first quarter levels due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in January 1, 2025, in our 2024 fiscal year, which is when many of the term licenses renew. Our ARR measure evens out the lumpy nature of term license revenue and we believe it is the best measure of growth in AECO. It's important to note that term license revenue is highly profitable, so the profitability in our AECO segment and at the company level will be highest in the first quarter and fourth quarter and lower in the second and third quarters. \n In the Field Systems segment, we had strong sales of geospatial technology to government customers in both the second quarter of 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, which we do not expect to repeat in the second quarter. Transportation revenues and organic growth will be modestly lower in the second quarter, primarily reflecting reduced low-margin hardware sales in our North American mobility business. At this point, we expect the total company third quarter revenue will be similar to second quarter revenue with fourth quarter revenue, the high point for the year, assisted by $85 million in revenue from the 53rd week. Operating and EBITDA margins for the year are expected to follow these same trends. We look forward to providing you with more details on the drivers and economics of these segments at our Investor Day event in December. \n Rob, I'll turn it back to you. Jerry, it's Phil. And thanks and good question because I know there's a lot of moving parts in our outlook. So, yes, if you think about Q1, as I talked about the term licenses, are largely a Q1 dynamic and that's that $50 million drop from Q1 to Q2. So if you look at the margin basis, I think it's around 400 -- a little bit more than a 400-point drop. So the large part of that, I'll put it into actually 4 buckets, half of that or a little over half of that is because of the dynamic of the term license. If you remember, as the term licenses actually get recognized all upfront. So that's high-margin revenue. And then as you move into Q2, the other 2 pieces are, one, we have our merit raises that take effect in April. And so that's about 100 basis points and then another 100 basis points is some additional OpEx primarily around the AECO business and the sales and marketing and R&D spend that we're -- we've talked about incremental spend there to continue to drive that growth engine. So -- and then the remainder is the term license to bridge that 400 points. No, I think that's right, Rob. Yes. Josh, it's Phil. So I'll answer -- your second question is the easy one. Yes, you are thinking about it correctly. Our 53rd week encompasses January 1, 2025 and a large portion of our term licenses renew around that date. And so you are correct in thinking that the 53rd week roughly $70 million of the $85 million there are the term licenses that renew. On your first question, yes, the -- there is an element of choice in this within AECO that we've had and we continue -- we'll continue to have that's largely in our structures business. And some of it has to do with the complexity and the horsepower around the offering itself where it's challenging to move that more into the cloud. So you will see that dynamic going forward, at least for the foreseeable future. Correct. It's a limited subset of the total AECO offerings."

            "content": "Chad, so the process is that our 10-K was filed, as you know, in February and the PCAOB selected EY's audit of Trimble for their review. And as the EY team looked over their work papers on the internal control side of things, they concluded the documentation that they and we had would -- was not sufficient to meet the standards of the audit of internal controls. And Chad, the thing I'd point out is the EY support of our financials is unchanged. This is just about the internal controls. No issues with our numbers have been identified by EY or us. What's happening is, EY is going to go through enhanced audit procedures to confirm the numbers and then we will issue an amended 10-K which will enable us to issue the 10-Q as well. This -- we've looked at -- companies have gone through this and it takes probably more than 1 month, hard to predict the timing. It's inconvenient but we, at this point, have no reason to believe that our numbers will change and we're working cooperatively with EY to get through it."

            "name": "Robert Painter",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone. Before I get started, our presentation is available on our website and we ask that you refer to the safe harbor at the back. Our financial commentary will reflect non-GAAP performance metrics, including organic growth comparisons which refer to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. In addition, our P&L commentary will primarily emphasize our as-adjusted numbers, which exclude our agriculture business, better reflecting Trimble on a go-forward basis.  \n Starting on Slide 4. During the first quarter, we continued to advance our Connect & Scale strategy, which involves digitally connecting workflows within targeted industry segments and creating scale across Trimble through shared technology platforms. Our strategy delivers outcomes in the form of unique value to our customers and sustainable value creation to our shareholders. We want to convey 3 key messages today, starting with a solid performance in the quarter, where all 3 segments performed ahead of expectations as detailed on Slides 5 and 6. $2.03 billion of ARR grew 13% organically, as-adjusted revenue grew 8% organically, as-adjusted gross margins were a record 67.5%, as-adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 290 basis points to 27.9% and free cash flow was strong at $227 million. We are confirming our previous total year guidance despite unfavorable currency moves and we will provide an update on our next call as we build confidence in the months ahead.  \n Key message #2 is a strategic portfolio highlight. In the first quarter, we divested certain water monitoring assets, our 21st divestiture in the last 4 years. And on April 1, we closed our PTx Trimble joint venture. I'm proud to have established this precision ag joint venture with Eric Hansotia and his team at AGCO. This is a high character team with a bold vision. These moves simplify and focus our organization and provide cash to strengthen our balance sheet and support our capital allocation strategy.  \n Key message #3 on Slide 7 is that our new reporting segments are in place, which align to our new organizational structure. We provided historical data on the segments to investors on April 12. It takes an enormous amount of work to affect change on this scale and I'm grateful to our Trimble colleagues for their courage and dedication. The sum of these actions will simplify and focus our business, thereby enabling us to reset to a new and better baseline as we aim to perform to our full potential. As evidenced on an as-reported basis, our first quarter revenue was 73% software, services and recurring and 58% recurring. While on an as-adjusted basis, our first quarter was 77% software, services and recurring and 63% recurring.  \n Turning to the segments. Let's start on Slide 8 with our AECO segment. Connect & Scale is well in motion here and it is working. Connect is about connecting users, data, stakeholders and workflow across the industry life cycle continuum. Our right to win starts with the breadth, depth and connectedness of our offerings. It bookends by delivering solutions that connect the physical and digital worlds. Scale is about making Trimble easier to do business with and enabling efficient and effective growth. In the quarter, we moved our go-to-market team to an account-based selling model. We expanded our prepackage to Trimble Construction One offerings and we released our next version of systems transformation, which is providing us new insights into our customers. \n Mark Schwartz and his team delivered record first quarter bookings, an 18% increase in ARR and margin expansion of 430 basis points. This business is a multiyear overnight success. And we trust the new reporting structure now gives enhanced visibility to the quality of the business we have been transforming over the last few years.  To emphasize the point, this is a scaled $1.1 billion ARR segment operating as a Rule of 40 plus business, in fact, a Rule of 50 plus in the quarter. Market conditions remain favorable at the moment with strength in subsegments such as reshoring and onshoring of manufacturing, EV and battery plants, data centers and renewable energy projects. The physical side of our business is largely conveyed in our new Field Systems reporting segment with key highlights on Slide 9.  \n This business is predominantly hardware but that discrete word underplays the importance of this business to our strategy. Think of this as industrial IoT, the data collection node in the physical world that provides us the ability to connect the physical and digital worlds. In this business, we are continuing to transform our selling models, moving towards hybrid models where we increasingly monetize aspects of the solution as recurring revenue. Thus, the segment revenue splits approximately 50-50 as hardware and software. On an as-adjusted basis, which excludes our agriculture business, Ron Bisio and his team grew revenue by 1%, while increasing operating margins by 250 basis points to 26.9%. Software, services and recurring revenue are 48% of business and ARR grew 14%, evidence of our Connect & Scale strategy in motion in this segment. \n Market conditions remain mixed and overall slightly positive. We see strength in the same subsegments as AECO, including infrastructure spend. On the cautious side, we see economic weakness in pockets of Europe and Asia Pacific, most notably through lower OEM retail unit sales and continued weakness in residential construction. We are closely monitoring U.S. GDP growth, along with global interest rate dynamics and how that will impact capital purchases.  \n Closing our segment commentary on Slide 10. Transportation and Logistics began the year with a solid start. We closed the Transporeon acquisition last April. Thus, it is excluded from the organic comparison in the first quarter. On the heels of record fourth quarter bookings, the Transporeon team delivered a record first quarter bookings. Chris Keating and his team reorganized their go-to-market strategy and recommitted to process excellence and organizational focus. They are also delivering innovation, most notably through AI-driven product releases in autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation, which have found product market fit. \n They predominantly deliver this bookings growth in a European region that continues to experience a freight recession, thus demonstrating that selling a winning value proposition and backing it up with innovation and process improvement can generate positive results even in a tough market environment. They also delivered a multi-hundred thousand dollar annualized contract value global cross-sell win, selling autonomous procurement to an existing enterprise software customer that is notably in North America. We've also begun cross-selling our map solutions into Transporeon's European customer base. We remain confident this is an exciting Trimble business with a compelling right to win and an attractive business model that enables a series of land and expand product-led growth opportunities.  \n In context of the bookings and ARR growth, we will continue to allocate capital to our go-to-market expansion. In the rest of the segment, the 4% organic revenue growth was driven by our Enterprise and Maps teams, which each grew double digit. Excluding Transporeon, we have delivered consistent margin expansion since the end of 2021. Including Transporeon the segment expanded margins by 480 basis points in the quarter.  \n Before I turn it over to Phil for his first call as our incoming CFO, let me once again express my gratitude to David Barnes for his service and partnership over these last few years. Phil, over to you. Thanks, Phil. When we think about our right to win at Trimble, we believe we can uniquely bring together users and connect workflow between the physical and digital worlds across industry continuums. Connect & Scale as our strategy, our strategy as an industry platform strategy, our platform strategy is in turn a data strategy. If we are successful in our pursuits, we will collect one of the most complete data sets in and across industries, creating a flywheel of enhanced insights and data connectivity, thereby enabling our customers to transform how they work while building a competitive moat around our business. Thanks to all our Trimble colleagues for delivering a solid start to the year and for demonstrating resilience and conviction as we continue to transform how we work so that we can transform how the world works. \n Operator, we can now open the line to questions. I'm going to turn it to David Barnes. David is staying on with us to see this through to its conclusion. And so David, why don't you? So bookings in the quarter continued to be strong. So put together really a couple of years now of strong progression in the bookings. The bookings -- the ACV bookings were over 20% growth in the quarter. So we like what we're seeing in terms of the progression there. Within that, Trimble Construction One is clearly an offering that we've been talking a lot about over the last, say, 1 year, 1.5 years. The bookings grew faster than that within Trimble Construction One. So Trimble Construction One, we're continuing to increase the level of adoption through that as we've transformed our selling organization and the processes and the systems to go along with that. So I'll give you an example, in North America, I think about 80% of our bookings were Trimble Construction One bookings within the quarter and those grew at a level of almost 2x the bookings level growth on a year-over-year basis. So strong progression, Chad. Jason, the breakdown on that is about 2/3, 1/3, 2/3 existing logos, 1/3 new logos. So if we take new logos, what we see is that the offering is expanding the addressable market. In some cases, that's allowing us to go, I'd say, more than the small, mid-sized end of the market with the offering. And then on the, let's call it, the mid- to upper end of the market, we continue to see customers wanting to buy into an ecosystem. We think that's driving a good amount of the growth. Team has done a great job executing. Yes, good question. So on the macro side within AECO, what I would comment on, is that we see good growth in onshoring, reshoring of manufacturing, we see -- and you see that in Europe and North America. Renewables, data centers, these are strong growers in North America and those bookings and ARR growth supports that. Residential, with interest rate environment is on the other side of that. Trade, that aspect of the market is a bit more challenged. We actually also, Jason, have quite a bit of data within our own systems. As you know, we're managing nearly 1/3 of U.S. construction through our systems. And so we can see that hiring is up in the market here in North America in the nonresidential space. We can see geographically that there's been the largest growth in the Midwest, followed by the Southeast with Florida, Carolinas and Georgia. Jonathan, it's Rob. Good question. We actually already see that in AECO. And so you can see the growth in the quarter, for example, was the 18% on the ARR as well as 18% revenue. If you look in transportation and logistics, you actually have the same phenomenon -- total revenue up for ARR up [ 4% ].  So it correlates to the amount of recurring, it's in that. The one that will be disconnected and would remain so for, I think, a number of years would be field systems, which is predominantly a hardware business. I think they recurring, as I recall it, in the 20% range on that. So those will remain separated and thus, leave a separation at the total company level. Yes, a good question as well. So another strong quarter of bookings growth. That's 2 quarters in a row of records for the business, a record Q4 and then a record with the Q1 as well. What I would say is, there's a few things to add on to that. So the team began successfully cross-selling Transporeon solutions to existing Trimble Transportation customers here in North America, which exemplifies go-to-market synergies and we think we're just getting started. Conversely, we've been selling some of our maps solutions into the European market. Those bookings growth were both with the shippers and carrier customers. \n And that's important because we continue -- the team is continuing to grow network participants on all sides of the transportation management platform, which effectively connects the buyers and the sellers of freight. Dozens of new logos were added in the quarter. I like what we're seeing from new products development as well with autonomous procurement and autonomous quotation. So I'd say a number of things coming together. The team is executing quite well in which is still a very difficult economic or difficult freight market economy, doubly so in Europe. Well, so the Transporeon will certainly help them at the company level in terms of bringing up the ARR growth potential. The other side of that is the mobility business. And so the net of that gets to the guide that we put forward, Jerry. At this point, no. No, we're maintaining the outlook on that. It has -- I mean, it would buy us more than above to the mid but we're going to leave that guide where we are right now. Kristen, great question. Let me take that twofold. First, with the, call it, the 100 bps of investment -- OpEx investment into the AECO segment that Phil referenced. More than half of that is at the sales and marketing level. So that's putting feet on the street, sellers to go get the business that we think is there. About 1/4 of it is in R&D as we continue to drive connectivity and interoperability between the solutions driving workflow capabilities as well as AI investments we're making into the products. And then the remainder is in G&A, which is really the systems investments and the systems investments, which are enabling a lot of this to happen. \n So then at the level when we think about the return on investment that we're making to put into the business, we look at that lifetime value over the customer acquisition cost. And the easy heuristic is, when we're at a ratio above 3, that's telling us to and lean forward and invest into the business. We're well above that as of, call it, as a floor of our thinking. And so when we do that math, this is -- actually, it's a pretty straightforward exercise to say we should be leaning into investing in this business to go after the market, especially when we're delivering well above the Rule of 40, and in fact, above Rule of 50 in the [Audio Gap]. Yes, it's a great question. So on a multiyear basis, I would frame this market as the largest available TAM that we have to service. We know the multitrillion dollar size of global construction. We're playing both in vertical construction, horizontal construction. We know it's a market that's large, global, underserved, underpenetrated, has challenges with productivity at the intersection of productivity and sustainability, which our solutions positively affect. We see more and more customers wanting to buy into ecosystems and our right to win, we think begins with the breadth and depth of solutions we have across the continuum of the life cycle. Furthermore, if you subscribe to a notion that the world is becoming more data-centric, more data-driven, then  you will like the touch points we have across this industry where we can, we believe, move from optimizing tasks to optimizing systems. \n So we think we're well and uniquely positioned to do so. With respect to how we then think about existing versus new logos. Within the existing customer base we have, we think that there's hundreds of millions of dollars of untapped ARR to mine through cross-sell and upsell, given the breadth of that installed base that we have. With the systems investments that we're making, it becomes more efficient to go to market. Some of those investments are creating -- starting to create the ability for customers to self-provision licenses, more e-commerce capabilities are starting to come to market. That, in turn, creates a more efficient go-to-market motion into the smaller end of the market. And so that, we think, would be another TAM that we can unlock through the nature of the business model and the efficiency of which we go to market. \n We for sure think that we can continue to win new logos along the way as customers and the market overall continues to adopt and continues to digitize. I would expect within that 5 years that the majority of that revenue would come through the existing base in this land and expand motion. So that's the expectation I'd want to set there. So continue to feel very, very positive about the work in this business and the progress that we're making and we'd like to think that we're just getting started. Thanks for the question. Well, we certainly are following what the OEMs are reporting on their unit sales, both at a retail side and a wholesale demand level. And there's for sure a correlation within Field Systems business we have and the OEM. So we have OEM exposure let's say, in field systems that we really don't have nearly as much of in the other 2 segments of the business. What we would see through our own numbers is that the European economy is more challenged and we've seen some of the prints out there on units in, let's say, Europe, in construction, although interestingly enough, our Europe business in field systems performed quite well, relatively well in the first quarter. \n So it's not a perfect, let's say, R-squared on that correlation. We're also fundamentally architected to serve the aftermarket and to serve the mixed fleet within that. So there's also another, I'd say, call it, the mindset that we have is not to be driven by what are new unit sales, although we do obviously sell on to new units as we see many, many hundreds of thousands of millions of machines that would benefit from having Trimble technology on and machine types like excavators remain low single-digit penetrated with technology. \n And so we think there's enormous opportunities to drive technology adoption into the base of machines that are out there. That's just the civil construction side of the business. So in Field Systems, surveying and mapping is an important business for us and I would say we disconnect that from the unit sales coming out of the machinery manufacturers. And there, a surveyor fundamentally creates a digital model of the physical world, that work could be an oil and gas workflow, could be cadastral survey, could be in residential application. It could be in our national parks. There's a wide variety of applications in that market, which would be independent of machine units. I hope that helps provide some color. Rob, thanks for the question. You're right about the original thesis of it is, we didn't, let's say, create our model fundamentally around bringing the European applications into North America. We saw that as additive opportunities and we for sure saw that we could do it. We just didn't predicate the deal on that being the fundamental thesis. So yes, hey, good news or that's the, the example, the customer I talked about in the prepared remarks, it's a multi-hundred thousand dollar ARR win that we have. And it actually is using the autonomous quotation product that we talked about earlier as well. So not even, let's say, the -- let's call it, the older or existing application capabilities we had in the business, it's actually a new one and so we find that very interesting to think about. \n What's most unique about what we have and special about the North America installed base, it's carrier-centric, is the nature of our customers. So when we look at capabilities to bring into North America on the carrier side, that would look like autonomous quotation and it's really creating automation around spot transactions. So that's something that makes sense for our sellers to be able to introduce to the existing customer base. In addition, we've talked before about Engage Lane in North America and the marketplace in Europe. We brought those organizations or those teams together into 1 team to create a global -- what's called global scale and global opportunity around that. So that's another example. And then the third example is real-time visibility. We're doing that as 1 business now, not separately in Europe and North America. And so that would -- those would be additional capabilities, then we want to penetrate here into the North America and yes. Yes, it's a good question, Rob, and Phil can chime in after I set this up. And you're right, there was an ag  [indiscernible] there in the numbers that you see. But in addition to that, we think about transitioning more of those hardware models into an element of recurring revenue. And that will naturally have a gross margin impact. So think about a system that might have sold for, let's call it, $40,000 system and that for us from a, I'll call it accounting perspective, has an element of hardware and software that's in that. And let's say that, that traditionally was splitting, we'd call it, $25,000 of hardware and $15,000 of software, so $40,000 sale. That might now convert to $25,000 and for the hardware upfront and a subscription of $5,000 a year. And in that case, that will have near-term headwinds to the gross margins. Now we're not flipping a switch and going 100% that direction, Rob. But you can see from the ARR growth that was 13% ARR growth in the first quarter, that it is a model that we are moving towards. So on a longer-term basis, that could be 200 to 300 basis points of a headwind. \n Phil, do you want to add anything to that? Yes. Josh, it's Rob. I'll take this one. I think it's a really good question. It's not just business as usual. It really does change how we're thinking about the business, how we're running it in some of -- at least the value creation opportunities that this unlocks. This does simplify and focus the company and I think provides a great new baseline for us as we move forward in executing the strategy. If we look at the AECO assets in that segment as an example, this is a business that is now operating at over $1 billion in ARR. It's a scaled ARR software business. This mandate in the business enables the team to take, let's say, the processes and the systems capabilities across a broader swath of the business than what we were doing previously. \n If I look within Field Systems, as an example, there, this is the first time in decades that we've had our survey business and our civil construction business under 1 leadership. That is providing a sharper focus and frankly, a level of accountability to sharing R&D capabilities, being more thoughtful about our positioning technologies and how we're using them across the business. It's driving better outcomes in terms of attaching things like our positioning services business to the hardware that we sell in survey and civil construction. And then super importantly, at a go-to-market level, the similar competency within this is selling, simply put, selling hardware through a global dealer channel. So we're bringing more efficiency in how we go to market. That is to say, we have 1 leader in Asia Pacific, 1 in the European region and 1 in the Americas. So 3 leaders from these regions overseeing the scope of what we do in survey and civil. Previously, that would have been 6 people instead of 3. \n So that, for us, is providing better and more consistent management at the dealers and then it enables a different way to think about capital allocation where we can put some of those resources and to help the dealers plan their long-term business health and their strategies to complement the work they're doing in the short term to help them identify the market opportunities and make the number. Transportation arguably had the least amount of change and there, it would feel probably a bit more like business as usual. Yes. No, I like the question. And I used the words in the prepared remarks about a multiyear overnight success. This journey is 1,000 little steps. We launched Connect & Scale of January 2020. I think what we have now creates a new baseline. But let's also look at the facts in -- the fact base, I should say. In 2018, we had $1.1 billion of ARR. We closed Q1 at $2.03 billion of ARR. In 2018, we were 31% recurring revenue as a business, as-adjusted in Q1 were 63% ARR. We had EBITDA of 22.6% in 2018. We closed Q1 at 27.9%. Structurally, our gross margins in 2018 were 58% in Q1, adjusted to 67.5%. Over the last 5 years, we produced 44% operating leverage. \n We haven't just decided that this is the direction that we're going. We've been working on this for a number of years. So now as we take this as the baseline, I think one of the probably one of the better things that as an outcome of the resegmentation is that transparency and that visibility to the investment community, which is what you're highlighting. It is very obvious to see in that AECO business now. This is a scaled ARR business operating well above Rule of 40, growing ARR in the high teens, produced 37.4% operating income in the first quarter. I'm emphatically positive and proud of the team and what they've accomplished on that. \n So I look forward in the 3-year time frame, we're looking -- we talk about ARR and free cash flow. To me, those are the big bookends, not the only bookends but they're 2 of the biggest bookends that we have to drive value. So I'd say in the 3-year time frame, you should be looking for continued ARR growth. We should be able to continue to progress the structural gross margins, as software I would expect, would outgrow hardware over that time frame. The structural gross margin improvement is an enabler of an ability to drive operating leverage. We drive operating leverage, that means we're driving increased levels of EBITDA. And then as Phil said in his prepared remarks, I think cumulative free cash flow is the game in the long-term game. And so we'd be looking to continue to progress the free cash flow in the business relative to the net income that we have. That's the quantitative framework I'd have around that. Hope that helps. This is Rob. I'll take that one. So it was a -- it's a multi-hundred thousand dollar ARR, it's over $400,000 ARR in that example that I used, so therefore, the ACV is over the $400,000 -- yes, $400,000 as well. In terms of the go-to-market motion, it's the -- think of it as a named account seller who is responsible for the account in North America, bringing in a sales engineer or sales specialist from Transporeon, who knows the depth of the functionality to be able to, I'd say, be conversant with the customer and the value proposition and how to use it. And that's actually very similar, Tami, to Trimble Construction One when we're selling a breadth of offerings, we'll often have what we -- now we do have named account sellers. And then we can bring in the specialists -- technical specialist to really know the depth of a given solution to make sure that customer can get the most value out of that. Did that answer your question? Okay. So hey, on the -- what's the multiyear targets, we're going to have an Investor Day in December. And Phil mentioned that in his prepared remarks. I think we have been saying second half of the year but we're narrowing that to December. So that's the formal update. I appreciate that in the interim there will be questions of how do we think about that progression of the business and the model. And I think that we can continue to provide color in the next couple of calls. But what we already know is the baseline and I want to highlight that. We know we have a baseline from the quarter on -- or you can actually say, take the year, where we're guiding at the -- for the level of EBITDA for the company between 26.5% and 27.5%. We've talked about the ARR growth. They're guiding 11% to 13% organic. \n So if you apply the -- if you take the EBITDA that we have and you continue to play forward the growth we expect and apply operating leverage on that, it's not that hard to see that we could [Audio Gap] of gross margin improvement a year. [Audio Gap] And if that plays through, then you can get to a 2027 in a plus or minus frame and then we'll put the finer points and the details around that in -- sorry, in December for 2027 or wherever we decide to set the next multiyear mark."
