At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jimmy Sexton, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nJimmy Sexton: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us on Snowflake\u2019s Q4 fiscal 2021 earnings call. Joining me are Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will review our financial results for fourth quarter fiscal 2021 and discuss our guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2022. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, products and features, long-term growth, and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, that we will file with the SEC. We caution you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or changes in our expectations. We\u2019d also like to point out that on today\u2019s call we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes, and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. To see the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings press release distributed earlier today and our investor presentation, which are posted at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks, Jimmy, and good afternoon, everybody. We finished our fiscal year with strong consumption across our customer base with 116% growth year-on-year to $178 million in fourth quarter product revenue. Remaining performance obligations of $1.3 billion grew 213% year-on-year, reflecting strengthened sales across the Board. Coupled with this rapid growth, we saw improving operating efficiency, while onboarding over 800 new employees for the year. Our growth is driven by long-term secular trends in data science and analytics, and enable by cloud scale computing and Snowflake\u2019s cloud native software architecture. With the onslaught of digital transformation, data operations become the beating heart of the modern enterprise. Customers realize that to survive and thrive they need to step up their data game given what is now possible with technology. The Snowflake Data Cloud enables breakthrough data strategies. Capacity limitations are a thing of the past. There are virtually no constraints anymore on the number of workloads that can execute at the same time against the same data. The performance of individual workloads has increased by orders of magnitude while latency has been reduced at similar proportions. The only constraints left are budgets and our customer\u2019s imagination and we believe those boundaries are shifting quickly as well. The Snowflake Data Cloud also breaks new ground in terms of data access, which is increasingly critical for data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. The days of mostly in silo analytics are numbered. The promise of data science is to discover and mobilize data relationships that can be glimpsed across a broad diversion -- diversity of data sources and data types. The physical boundaries between data sets dictated by technology legacies have no meaning or significance in data science. Science sees the world\u2019s data as a single universe that is easily seamlessly and frictionless traversed as if it was one giant database. That is the essence of the Snowflake Data Cloud, world class workload execution coupled with practically unfettered data access across clouds, cloud regions and geographies. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager has adopted the Snowflake Data Cloud to help make the best investment decisions for their clients. Last week we announced a strategic partnership to launch the Aladdin Data Cloud powered by Snowflake. Now Aladdin clients can combine Aladdin portfolio data with non-Aladdin data to analyze faster and create custom applications and dashboards. Clients will have a single control plan to make data driven positions around portfolio management, trade execution, investment operations, analysis and risk management. With Aladdin becoming a strategic part of the Snowflake Data Cloud our shared goal with BlackRock is to create a cutting edge industry standard for access and governing and acting on data in a unified and governed data environment. The data cloud is inspiring more new conversations with customers and prospects, and it leads them to a different view of the data strategies going forward. Active data showing our relationships in the Snowflake Data Cloud are growing by leaps and bounds increasing 51% quarter-on-quarter. We are seeing rapid adoption of the Snowflake marketplaces as well, with consumption attributable to data from marketplace providers up 48% quarter-over-quarter and new listings growing 10x year- on-year to a total of 380 as of the end of the fiscal year. Newly added to the marketplace in Q4 are data providers such as Zoominfo, Western Union and Foursquare. A continued push to campaign the large enterprises in the world is proving to be successful. We added 19 Fortune 500 customers in Q4, including MasterCard, Genuine Parts, Northern Trust. Our customers choose to partner with Snowflake because of the data cloud we still must meet customers wherever they are on their technology joining. Often engagements beginning with a migration of legacy data warehouse platforms. We have engaged in over 75 legacy migrations last year and we have identified many more for this year. Our Global System Integration partners or GSIs have seen their backlogs multiply and are rushing to staff, train and provision to resources to meet the demand head on. While we team up with our GSIs, our strategy is to rely on our implementation partners for much of this work. We are pleased to welcome Infosys to Snowflake Elite Partner Status during the quarter. A Fortune 100 technology company has deployed Snowflake across numerous lines of business since migrating their on-premise data warehouse platform to Snowflake, because Snowflake their marketing department tells to more informed decision-making process with 20 times faster support for their customers. For fiscal 2022, our focus is to turbocharge our Snowflake Data Cloud with massive workload execution extensions and refinements, as well as extend our date of federation with numerous new additions to the Snowflake marketplace. While our selling motions to address some of the world\u2019s smallest, as well as largest data states in the world, we will have continued emphasis on landing and expanding in the largest enterprises institutions, not just in the Americas, but also in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. To that end, we have announced new leadership in the latter region to accelerate and scale this Snowflake campaign there. A new global initiative we began last year and are now accelerating is a vertical industry focus, which is permeating our sales, marketing, alliances, product and service organizations. We have long sold almost exclusively on architectural distinction, which has served us well and we will continue to do so in situations that warranted. But our large enterprise focus has informed an evolution to go-to-market motion that is industry specific and outcome oriented. We view this as a maturation of Snowflake in a large enterprise. We also now have so much critical mass in our target verticals coupled with industry specific data marketplaces that this strategy will further differentiate Snowflake. We are super excited about the New Year. We have the technology, the talent and the organization to fully pursue our opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. Q4 was another quarter of exceptional execution and a strong finish to our first fiscal year as a publicly [Technical Difficulty]. Our Q4 product revenues were $178 million representing 116% year-over-year growth and remaining performance obligations were $1.3 billion. The outperformance of consumption spanned all verticals as we continue to see our customers deploy Snowflake across their organizations. Our strong RPO results continue to be driven by more multi-million dollar deals, as well as our customers\u2019 willingness to engage in multiyear contracts up to $1.3 billion in RPO. We expect approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. As a reminder this number is an estimate and can fluctuate significantly due to our consumption business model. The strong performance reflects Snowflakes role as both a technology solution, offering superior execution across workloads and as a strategic partner enabling digital transformation through the data cloud. We continue to invest in growth opportunities and we are now benefiting from our maturing enterprise sales efforts. In Q4 we saw the number of customers with greater than $1 million in trailing 12 months product revenue increased to 77%, up from 65% last quarter, with 12 customers are now consuming over $5 million on a trailing 12 month basis. Internationally, we have expanded our sales force across relevant geographies. We are seeing promising traction in these markets, but remain in the early stages of this opportunity. Turning to margins, on a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 70%, up 400 basis points from last year. Favorable cloud service agreements, growing scale across regions, our enterprise success and ongoing discounting discipline, all contribute to steady gross margin improvement. Our operating margin was negative 24%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and continued T&E savings. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 9%, positively impacted by strong collections with Q4 being our largest booking quarter, cash inflows relating to our employee stock purchase program and operating margin outperformance. As a reminder adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of cash paid for employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions. This quarter we saw a $10 million impact from those items. While we will continue to focus on long-term margin expansion and profitability, we do experience free cash flow seasonality in Q1 and Q4 will continue to be our strongest free cash flow quarters. We are very proud of our strong free cash flow. On a year-over-year basis, we cut our annual cash burn by 64% or $128 million or more than doubling the business. And we have implemented operations that will help us show more profitability, we are continuing to invest heavily in the business. We have ended the year in a strong cash position, with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments. This enables us to explore a number of strategic initiatives, including Snowflake Ventures, which has made several investments in the quarter, including DataRobot, Hunters, NOMA and Lacework. Our mission is to engage more organizations with the data cloud and all investments aim to drive increased consumption of Snowflake. Now, let\u2019s turn to our guidance and outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $195 million and $200 million, representing year-over-year growth between 92% and 96%. Turning to margins, we expect on a non-GAAP negative 23% operating margin and we expect $289 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $1 billion and $1.02 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 81% and 84%. Turning to profitability, we expect on a non-GAAP basis 71% product gross margins, negative 19% operating margins and breakeven adjusted free cash flow and we expect $295 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our outlook includes increased investments and FedRAMP initiatives and accelerating migrations off of legacy solutions, both of which will drive enterprise customer success. In order to support our growth initiatives, we plan on adding more than 1,200 net new employees during the year. With respect to COVID, our forecast assumes that we will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future, with an increase to potential travel expenses in the back half of the year. We are benefiting from strong productivity in our current environment and we have successfully on boarded and ramped new employees since March 2020. Well we anticipate an eventual return to the office. We do not have a specific timeline for that goal. Before closing, I\u2019d like to know a few recent or upcoming events. Today, we announced that on March 1, 2021, our Class B shareholders in accordance with their governing documents converted all of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock eliminating the dual class structure of our common stock and ensuring that each share has an equal vote. We view this as operationally beneficial to the company and their shareholders. In addition, the restrictions under our IPO lockup expire on March 5th and almost all remaining shares not purchased in the private placement are secondary transactions concurrent with their IPO will no longer be subject to a lockup agreement. And lastly, we will host a virtual Investor Day in conjunction with Snowflake Summit our annual users\u2019 conference the week of June 7th. If you are interested in attending please email ir@snowflake.com. With that, Operator, you can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey. Congrats. That was detailed amazing numbers. First one, Frank, this quarter we saw a little bit more noise around kind of market activity. I think it\u2019s probably because of your success. Can you see -- if you explain pretty changes in the competitive dynamic out there and then I have a follow up for Mike?\nFrank Slootman: Not really, Raimo, and things have been stable and certainly from the public cloud standpoint perfect, the course, there in terms of the comparisons with the legacy providers, no change there either. If I sort of take a global perspective on it, I would say, that I feel that our competitive position is gradually strengthening in anticipation that are the types of interactions we have with customers. We are operating far more at CEO level now than at the highest level of IT. So, there is definitely I feel an inflection there that is reflecting the relative position of the company, the marketplace, which we feel is very good.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Hey. Thank you. Again, Mike, on the gross margins, I mean, we have seen the progress this year and you gave us guidance. Just talk a little bit about the drivers for the gross margin improvement we are going to expect in the coming year and what it is -- like is it more the contracts with the cloud providers or what\u2019s driving it going forward and what led to do for you to reach the long-term goals? Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: Yeah. I would say, the contracts with the cloud provider started kicking in Q3 and we had the full benefit in Q4. I don\u2019t anticipate renegotiating our cloud contracts next year. We may be in a situation at the end of the year, but I am not expecting that. It\u2019s really driven by getting more scale within our existing deployments. We have a number of deployments where we are not at scale and we see those ramping right now. As an example, like, Japan. Japan has been running at a negative gross margin, because we just don\u2019t have very many customers but we are starting to ramp there that that will turn around and that\u2019s just one example. We are in 20 deployments around the world and think of a deployment as a data center out places. But also as we move higher up into larger enterprises they tend to buy our higher addition our business critical. Yes, those big customers require more discounting, but the margin -- the contribution margin from those higher SKUs more than offset that discounting to drive gross margin, which gives us the confidence that we will get to those mid-70s, it\u2019s not going to happen next year, but we see that continued gradual improvement.\nRaimo Lenschow: Prefect. Thank you. Congrats.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDerrick Wood: Yeah. Great. Thanks and congrats as well on a very strong quarter. I guess, first for Frank, how are you feeling about the ability to onboard sales people at a good clip and keep up the demand trends out there, particularly kind of in this work-from-home environment? And then heading into the New Year, any go-to-market tweaks your planning that you would call out?\nFrank Slootman: Yeah. So, in terms of sales people, I think, we are doing incredibly well and we are making a lots of changes and adjustments that are for strengthening our organization. I am sure you know that, year a half ago we separated our U.S. selling organization and enterprise, and what we call majors [ph] which are the largest 200 or so accounts and we really stepped up our staffing in that organization really, hiring the absolute best people available in the marketplace for this role. So I am really positive on that. In terms of what\u2019s changing on our go-to-market, I referenced that in the prepared remarks. I mean, we are very aggressively verticalizing our selling merchants and our general posture in accounts and we find it\u2019s very important that when we interact with customers. There\u2019s always an industry context in the conversation. We are much more outcome oriented. Customers are sometimes interested in architecture and things of that sort and comparing workloads and all of that. But increasingly when you get higher up in larger enterprises they just want to know what it means to their business, what are other people doing. So that is a significant change and we are investing literally at every level in the organization, so starting with products, moving into marketing and moving into alliances, as well as into sales and so this is a very serious effort that started last year and that will continue underway this year.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks. And Mike maybe one for you, nice uptick in new customers in the quarter and then you called out to what\u2019s helping drive that acceleration. Is it better productivity or more capacity or is it something you are starting to see on this viral networking effect from your data sharing. Is that something that can move the needle and starting to help lift the customer generation?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I would say, there was definitely an increase in average productivity per rep in terms of the number of cap one deals that they brought in on average in terms of the data sharing. I don\u2019t have any specific data on that but that is clearly a discussion point with every customer and one of the reasons why they choose to go with Snowflake. It helps the decision to go with Snowflake. That\u2019s also the fact that we are ramping. We have been adding so many reps and we have been ramping those people.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Well done. Thanks.\nMike Scarpelli: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPatrick Colville: Hey. Thank you so much for taking the question and congrats on an extremely impressive set of numbers. I just want to touch on the capacity environment. I mean the earlier question from Raimo was around competition with the cloud native vendors. But one of the legacy, call it, on-prem vendors put up some pretty impressive cloud numbers a month ago. How dynamics with the incumbents shaping out and yeah maybe a comment on that please?\nFrank Slootman: Yeah. Patrick, this is Frank. I can honestly say that in my almost two years here I have never seen the legacy provider being in -- they are running for a go forward destination for the platform, if you will. So and the competition it\u2019s always moving off of legacy platforms and the competition has been very, very focused on the public cloud options. What I will say is that, we are seeing the public cloud vendors having significant struggles in terms of migrating successfully off of these legacy platforms, which of course, brings relative strength to these -- to some of these legacy providers. I think that Snowflake is really the only platform that is successfully and consistently and now at scale moving these workloads to the cloud. But to some degree your legacy providers are hanging in there longer, because if you are not going to Snowflake you are going to have a struggle on your hands. So that\u2019s sort of my commentary on that topic.\nPatrick Colville: Yeah. I mean that\u2019s very helpful. And can I just ask a quick follow-on for Mike if possible? I -- it seems that implicit in guidance is that 1Q up margins looks like it will increase pretty materially year-on-year. Are you guys slowing up the pace of hiring or how should we think about that component?\nMike Scarpelli: No. We are absolutely not slowing hiring down. As we just mentioned, we are going to add 1,200 people next year. Actually Q1 is a very, very big onboarding quarter. It will be probably the largest quarter of the year, because we are onboarding a lot of people in the sales and marketing organization in advance of our sales kickoff that we just had. We are investing as quickly wellbeing efficient in our business as we can.\nPatrick Colville: Fantastic. Thank you so much and congrats a very impressive results.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. And I echo the congrats as well. Well done guys. I have got one for Frank and maybe one for Mike. Frank, can you share more about BlakRock partnership with a lagging cloud on the Snowflake Data Cloud. Specifically can you talk about the economics of these types of relationships and the success criteria that you use for gauging the progress? And maybe as well, how many partnerships like this are out there to go after?\nFrank Slootman: No. There\u2019s a lot of partnerships out there to go after. I think that that announcement by itself triggered a whole rash of conversations both from the financial industry, as well as other industries. This whole conversation around customers building their own data cloud is really the center of their universe, the way they interact with their partners, their customers, their stakeholders is a huge idea and people are seeing the opportunity and the potential, and obviously, for BlackRock because they are the world\u2019s largest asset manager with where they were leased $21 trillion, $22 trillion of assets under management. They realized that they needed to modernize and transform to be able to continue to be in a very dominant position and it was -- from an economic standpoint it\u2019s really no different than what we are doing, in other words this is not a different line of business for us. The same product, same business practices and so on. But obviously these relationships are highly strategic to us. They come -- they become cornerstones to the Snowflake Data Cloud in the data universe, because there\u2019s this is -- this induces network effect all over the place from people that need to have access to this data or provide access.\nMike Scarpelli: To say it in a simpler way, Brad, that all of those Aladdin customers that want data through Aladdin, if they want to get their data the most efficient way are going to have to be Snowflake customers.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. That makes perfect sense. And Mike, maybe just to follow up with you, it\u2019s great to see net retention continues to be really strong. I think that\u2019s in class of anything else we look at. But as we think about the cohort of customers that you have added in the last 12 months, how are they tracking relative to prior years? And maybe just ask differently, like, how do we think about the size of your lands today and how that might be changing and informs your view or our view on how we might think about that net retention rate going forward?\nMike Scarpelli: Yeah. So I do expect net retention rate this year to remain very high. It should be north of 160 throughout the year is what we are -- what we see right now. In terms of average deal size landing, that is not changing that much. What\u2019s happening and because I want to stress, it takes customers especially if you are doing a legacy migration. It can take customers six months plus before we start to recognize any consumption revenue from those customers because they are doing the data migration. And what we find is so they consume very little in the first six months and then remaining six months they consume their entire contract they have. Then when we do a renewal that\u2019s when most customers are doing the multiyear renewals once they have proven the use case on Snowflake. And so I haven\u2019t seen much difference other than we are, as you know, when Frank came in here, he really started focusing more on enterprise customers. We are landing more Fortune 500 customers. We talked about we landed 19 in the quarter. But those 19 we landed, just to reiterate, we recognized virtually no revenue on those customers. That\u2019s all in the RPO that will be in the next 12 months.\nBrad Zelnick: Awesome. Thanks so much gentlemen and stay well.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with JMP. Your line is open.\nPatrick Walravens: Oh! Great. Thank you and congratulations. Frank or Mike, can you double click on the migration. So why is it so hard to migrate legacy data warehouse? What are the steps you have to take that are so time consuming and then what is it about Snowflake platform to make it so much better suited do it than the cloud providers?\nFrank Slootman: So that\u2019s a great question. So, first of all, database migrations have been hard since time immemorial. They have never been easy. They have been lengthy. They have been expensive. They have been risky. And our customers are quite leery of them as well. One of the reasons is that, while we can analyze the data with the structures, we analyze the code, we can automatically convert a lot of it and usually there is no straightforward mapping of some of the data between these databases. Now for example, you take some of the legacy flavors out there, they have proprietary artifacts that just simply do not have a counterpart in Snowflake, because Snowflake is a completely standard NNC quote environment. So that means that we have to reengineer, we have to reach the structure, we have to optimize workloads, things of that sort. The integrity of the data is absolutely everything. When you do a data migration what makes customers fearful is. They want to make sure that when the systems land on the other side they are getting exactly the same results that they were getting before. So the integrity is 100% maintained and there is not a matter of this throw on a big switch and hoping for the best. So that\u2019s a little bit of color and texture why these things are viewed as a sort of high friction. Now we are good at it, because we are experts at this. This is what we do. And we have a ton of experience doing it and that accumulated experience, as well as a lot of the tooling that we have to support these efforts, it\u2019s resulting in a very good results, a very predictable results, time wise, cost wise and outcome, so that\u2019s why.\nPatrick Walravens: All right. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Frank, a lot of the customers are excited your journey to unstructured. I am just curious if you could update us on that journey and how far out our customer is going to have to wait. What are you starting to see in terms of the discussions around the commitment beyond the structured stance you already have?\nFrank Slootman: Yeah. Well, so, Brent, first of all, I mean, we are 100% committed to that and it\u2019s from a strategy standpoint it is something we absolutely have to do. When you think of data sciences, data relationships don\u2019t just exist between like data. They exist between structured and unstructured data. That\u2019s actually where a lot of the power is going to come from the type of signals that we can drive out of the data. And I think I said last time that, we are going to really substantially update the world on where we are with that as well as demonstrate at our June usual events. So, you should really expect the second half where you are going to see the real results of that strategy starting to become available in private previews and things of that sort.\nBrent Thill: And one of the other things that the customers keep talking through Frank just as it relates to some of the partnerships whether it\u2019s with Tableau or Salesforce or ThoughtSpot, some of the other interfaces that\u2019s making your data more consumable by the mass market and we have heard some incredible stories of customers moving faster with you because of those partnerships. Can you just bring us up to speed on what you hear anything from customers and what some of the deployments look like that you are hearing kind of common feedback on? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: Well, we have relationships literally with every single business intelligence BI, vendor Tableau is definitely the largest one. But we also have -- we are going gangbusters with Power BI which is the Microsoft product also and we are going to -- we expect to see a lot of growth in that area as well. So, we are -- those relationships are really, really solid. We have a product of our own called Snowsight, which is really not meant to be so much competitive with the likes of Power BI and many of the others. That\u2019s really our homegrown if you will and better products really data analysts as opposed to for end user distribution. But listen there\u2019s no doubt that Snowflake makes these product absolutely sing. It\u2019s just a sheer scale of execution, the performance, the provisioning. So no without Snowflake it\u2019s just very difficult for these products to really have the snappy dynamic performance that users are looking for. So combination of this technology Snowflake with the entire family of the BA products out there, very, very important to deliver a good sort of end result to the customer.\nBrent Thill: Thanks Frank.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hey, guys. Thank you very much. Congratulations on a superb quarter. Two questions, Frank one for you, as you talked about how the decisions are increasingly being made by the C level, not just the CIA, but CEO level. Can you talk about how they are looking at Snowflake in relation to their digital transformation initiatives meet? Generally here customer experience, employee experience is fairly digital. Could you help us connect the dots what are your CEOs, customer CEOs thinking in regards to Snowflake and how Snowflake specifically drives the digital transformation. Maybe I will just at that? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: Yeah. So the angle they are taking is one of digital transformation. IT organizations are typically focused on what we call modernization. They are taking existing workloads. They want to move them from the on-premise environment to the cloud, but essentially take advantage of the utility model and all of that, but fundamentally running the same workloads on the platform like Snowflake. When you get to business people and CEOs, they are looking for new angles. They are looking for transformation, not just modernization. So it\u2019s often very easy to determine in these conversations whether people are after doing things differently and looking for advantage. Digital transformation plays a big role. What that means here is that, they are looking to drive signals out of their data. They are trying to define data relationships through data models that they can take advantage of. And once I can describe the data relationship I can predict it and I can even make prescriptions out of that as well. And things are going to go end-to-end digital, lights out, light speed, so it\u2019s the digital transformation is a big thing. You can think of things like really improving the efficiency and yield on marketing and sales outreach, improving service experiences, and obviously, very, very, very high scale and very, very high precision and very, very high economy on these type of processes compared to what they historically have done. The data cloud is central to these conversations. One of the things that we drive very hard is that, in future data operations are going to be very much dominated by data really moving in an orbit, where -- in other words data is flowing between partners and all kinds of stakeholders and people are able to not just analyze data in silos, but very effortlessly address data really across really a very broad orbit that includes their own data. But then external data sources data from partners, social media, IoT, structured unstructured. That\u2019s really where people are looking for significant advantage from where they historically have been.\nKash Rangan: Yeah. Got it. Frank and also your biggest customers, what are the problem areas they pushing you into that could open up the opportunities and that\u2019s it from me. Thank you so much.\nFrank Slootman: Sorry, what was it.\nMike Scarpelli: Our biggest customers what are the opportunities that are pushing us into.\nFrank Slootman: Well, the opportunities that are central to the conversations with our bigger customers are data cloud oriented. That means establishing data networking relationships, not just internally, but especially externally. I mean, we are well on our way in our journey. I mean where we disclosed some of the growth rates in our prepared remarks. But that conversation is front and center with every single customer, everybody\u2019s trying to figure out. Historically, we have shared data through APIs and through file transfer processes copying and replicating. It\u2019s been an enormous struggle. The opportunity with Snowflake is to make this zero latency, zero friction, completely seamless. So it is an enormous game changer to what people are used to and also that goes, of course, then.\nKash Rangan: Super. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Frank, early in the call you talked about the limit -- the limitlessness nature of the product set and that it\u2019s only limited by the customer\u2019s imagination. How do you help those clients manage budgeting issues, given the usage that they rack up on the system very quickly?\nFrank Slootman: Yeah. That\u2019s good question and certainly a topic that we discuss often. The big change in paradigm is that historically in on-premise data centers, people have to manage capacity. And now they don\u2019t manage capacity anymore, but they need to manage consumption. And that\u2019s a new thing for -- not for everybody but for most people -- and people that are in the public cloud. I have gotten used to the notion of consumption obviously because it applies equally to the infrastructure clouds. Now we do a lot, we have full blown chargeback capability, so that the consumers are -- of compute are and of our service and really accountable for what they do and don\u2019t do. We have hard limits, we have soft limits, we have notifications, we have dashboards. So there\u2019s a lot of ways to do this. But at the same time a very scares, people are really so motivated and inspired by the capabilities that they have. Sometimes they get a little bit out of control in terms of the amount of processing that they were planning to do and it\u2019s a very, very blunt situation. I mean we have been bottled up literally for generations and now there\u2019s a situation where there is no upper limit to how much you can do and that\u2019s intoxicating quite honestly. And we also see organizations really getting used to managing consumption and how much do we really want to allow, because often times we are very compelling reasons, why they do need to consume these services as opposed to just looking at the amount they spend. So it\u2019s manageable but it\u2019s a new discipline and it\u2019s a new mindset that everybody needs to get their head around and we provide the infrastructure and governance capabilities to do that.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. One quick for you, Mike, and then a follow-up for Frank. The dollar value of new contract signings exceeded -- in Q4 exceeded all of last year. And so my question is, there is some seasonality that drove that. Is this just improving sales productivity? Walk me through the drivers there of the RPO momentum on Q4 and then one quick follow up.\nMike Scarpelli: So, number of things. A, obviously you are always going to get seasonality because that\u2019s a bookings number and obviously sales people in Q4 are going to try to maximize their acceleration there into. But it\u2019s also a function of the number of reps that we have now are ramped up. And it\u2019s also a function of the fact that we are getting into larger customers as well too and it\u2019s not just the larger new customers, it\u2019s the existing large customers with big renewals, because we are growing within those customers in the multiyear component of those customers. As I mentioned earlier, most initial what we call cap one customers are tend to be one year contracts and if the renewal and the follow on that tends to be the multiyear once they have proven they use cases. That\u2019s not always the case. That\u2019s just what we have been seeing historically. I do expect as we become a larger company, we will see more and more of those capacity when customers sign up for multiyear deals day one as well.\nBrent Bracelin: Got it. Helpful color there. And then, Frank, we have heard internal use case for data sharing inside of a corporation has the potential to become believe the killer app here. You have some great stats on data marketplace which is really around sharing data externally. But do you have any color for us around internal use cases for data sharing. Are you seeing any sort of material changes and customer interests for internal data sharing use cases?\nMike Scarpelli: Yeah. The interesting thing is most of the data sharing is actually externally, not internally. And one of the reasons is, if I look at some of our larger customers, they maintain a single copy of all their data and they allow their operating functions and departments and business units to execute clusters against the single copy of the data. So they are sharing data effectively because they having a single copy of the data, right? So they don\u2019t have to take advantage of our data exchanges and data sharing because they are literally sitting on the same copy of the data and that\u2019s probably will be the reason why we should have two modes of sharing. One is really tightly coupled where everybody sits on the same data and the other one is the more loosely coupled one, which is through our data sharing architecture and customers can actually mix and match. It depends on their culture and how much they want to have custody their own data and things of that sort, that sort of drives where they land on that, but the architecturally the tightest model out that we have is where there\u2019s one copies of data for the entire enterprise and anybody that wants to process against that data, they fire up their own warehouses and their own clusters and they run their own workloads and that\u2019s an extremely successful model for Snowflake and our customers.\nBrent Bracelin: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nDavid Hynes: Hey. Thanks guys. I think I will echo everyone else\u2019s congrats, really impressive numbers. And just one for me, Frank, is there any way to think about a dollar spent with Teradata or when the legacy CW vendors turns into X amount of spend with Snowflake and I don\u2019t know if you can think about it that way, but at sometimes did investors saying, hey, Teradata peaked out a little less than $3 billion in revenue and look, I realize they are not the only share donator and I realize this is not only replacement. But it\u2019s gets at the question of like, how big can Snowflake really gets. So any thoughts to help us kind of frame that question?\nFrank Slootman: Yeah. Interesting thing is that a lot of the Teradata migration we have done, customers are telling us we are spending half the money and we are doing 10 times the amount of work and that may not be what you want to hear, but obviously that\u2019s a hell of a deal for them. What\u2019s really expanding the marketplace is that, historically there have been fixed capacity limits on how much work you could do and those are gone under the Snowflake platform. You can run as many workloads concurrently and you can provision those individual workloads as much as you need to. So all of a sudden it\u2019s like, hey, I don\u2019t have to wait in line for 2 a.m. slot to run my little job. It\u2019s like everything runs concurrently as much as you can possibly imagine that you want to do. Obviously, there is a financial consequence to running a ton of workloads, but there\u2019s no operational limit on that. Now what does is, it really starts to inspire people to do things they never entertain because there was not a possibility for them to ever do that. So we are sort of in this period where we are unleashing all this imagination, as well as all the backlog that has already existed that people are just rushing towards. Now because data as a driver of digital transformation, it is really the signals that fuel digital processes. It\u2019s just a very, very core component to how enterprises are evolving. So that\u2019s -- I think this market can get. We have been told by a number of our customers that we are the second largest line item in their budget behind the public cloud and that may come as a shock to some. But I am telling you that that\u2019s not going to be out of the ordinary going forward based on what we are seeing.\nDavid Hynes: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Thank you, Frank. At the Data Cloud Summit, Benoit had mentioned a goal to try to reduce end-to-end data latency by 10 times from where it is today, a pretty amazing goal. I was wondering if you could walk us through how long you think that might take and what types of new opportunities it could open up maybe for more complex analysis or larger AI models and so forth inside the Snowflake?\nFrank Slootman: Yeah. Probably we should bring Benoit into -- in here, let him answer that question, one of the areas that we are investing in where we have extraordinary talent that we have attracted the company as where our event driven architecture is. Today our event latency is sort of seconds and minutes, right? But you want to drive that down to sub-seconds and dramatically sub-seconds. You start to open up use cases that are just very different. That are really not approachable by a platform approach today. They really require very single purpose optimizations, right? When you think about electronic trading and all these things the latency has to be approaching zero. That obviously -- that requires tremendous optimization on our part and we are working on that because we see that as a very, very critical part of the ongoing evolution of digital transformation. We are doing a lot of stuff that is where -- what our capabilities are today are totally adequate. But we are foreseeing a world where and this has been lost at where we have to become much, much faster than what we have done so far. And certainly we have that room up, we know how to do it. So again this is going to expand the marketplace in places where these technologies historically have not been.\nMark Murphy: Thank you. And that\u2019s a good follow-up Mike, it sounds like you are moving up market in Beijing with more large enterprises pretty rapidly. Are you seeing a higher mix of Snowflake usage on Microsoft Azure or should we be pencil an AWS sticking around, I think, it\u2019s been 85% of the usage. Do you think it would hang in there for this fiscal year?\nMike Scarpelli: I think AWS will continue to be our largest cloud for quite some time, but we are definitely seeing a lot of large enterprise customers choosing to go with Microsoft. But you -- there were -- as I mentioned, the revenue is lagging when we book deal. So it\u2019s going to be second half of the year and even in 2020, our fiscal 2023, I think, you are going to see Azure kick up as a percentage, but we still think AWS will remain our number one cloud partner.\nMark Murphy: Thank you and congrats.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Hey. Thanks very much for taking my questions and I appreciate the stats on data sharing. I wanted to ask you about that, the strength there, I wanted to see if that\u2019s helping you accelerate the win of new logos, if you are able to land with that use case and maybe a customer where you hadn\u2019t been successful before? And then, as I think about that going forward, I mean, do you think data sharing could get to a point where you start breaking out that revenue over time? Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: Well, I am certainly hoping that we will break out that revenue over time. But obviously that\u2019s -- we are not there and we don\u2019t know when that will be, but you will be the first to know. What I will tell you, the data cloud conversation is so highly differentiated that\u2019s even in accounts that are completely dominated by incumbents that it reopens the conversation and we have seen that over and over and over. And so it\u2019s -- we love it, because it\u2019s just the conversation goes from just modernizing existing workloads breaking through the cloud, doing POCs benchmarking to all of a sudden we are talking about complete innovation transformation and that\u2019s inspiring for the customer, and obviously, it\u2019s great for Snowflake.\nTyler Radke: Yeah.\nMike Scarpelli: I would just add to that Tyler that, I don\u2019t anticipate breaking out data sharing revenue any time because it will be difficult. And the reason I say that is because, the whole data sharing is going to drive people to use Snowflake because they are going to have to consume their data, but that\u2019s just a piece of their data. What they will then do is do everything on Snowflake where they are pulling their own data sources from other places. So it\u2019s all mangled together. At the end of the day, what data sharing does is it drives stickiness and it drives consumption.\nTyler Radke: Got it. I think, Frank, got my hopes up around the disclosure there.\nFrank Slootman: We have got the accountant.\nTyler Radke: Just a follow up, just as you are thinking about this year, curious how your assumptions are on close rates and what you are putting into the forecast relative to last year as you think about the macro environment? Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: I would just say we gave guidance for next year and you are going to continue to see growth next year and we feel very good about what we are seeing right now, and we are not really seeing any impact on the macro in our business at all.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Rende with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMark Rende: Hi. Mark Rende on for Keith Weiss. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong quarter. I guess just one from me, with the evolution of the go-to-market towards vertical specific solutions as you better penetrate large customers. Is there anything to call out in terms of potential impact on the pace of large deals or execution more broadly? And then, I guess, generally what verticals are next after kind of financial services? Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: In terms of verticals, media is -- media and tech are huge financial services, healthcare, life sciences, public sector and the whole replatforming going on in the software companies\u2019 data applications. So there\u2019s -- we have obviously retail consumer packaged goods is a very important vertical for us also. So we have a lot of concurrent activity going on. Most of that is really related to our customers understanding who else is on Snowflake inside their vertical. How are they using it. What are the use cases? What are the outcomes? How are they doing it? And for us to be very, very proficient. And then also in terms of what is the data marketplace and data context in that vertical data sources are they using on the outside, are they providing data, are they consuming data from the outside. So those -- that\u2019s -- those are really the conversation that we are shifting towards. I mean what are they getting out of it in terms of business benefit and outcomes and it\u2019s very, very specific to their business. So, this is a considerable shift because in the past there was always workload comparisons, POCs, benchmarks. How fast is this job running versus this query? Now, we are at a level where we are really fully engaged at the top at the house and the business itself. So, it\u2019s very great for us, because the IP selling motion, while there is nothing wrong with that, that this brings another level of strength through to our outreach.\nMark Rende: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. So, I just want to start with a question on the $1 million or more customers, really strong growth again this quarter and I know it\u2019s a trailing 12 months calculation. So, I\u2019d assume some of that is coming from your existing customers versus new customers. I am just wondering if you could provide any more color or maybe around what\u2019s driving that.\nMike Scarpelli: Well. I would say 100% of that is coming from existing old customers. Because as I said, any customer we signed up in the current last fiscal year it takes them six plus months to ramp those significant customers. So, it\u2019s really coming from our existing customers and we have a number of other customers that are on the cusp of that. So we think we will continue to see that growth in million dollar plus trailing 12-month revenue customers going into next year.\nAndrew Nowinski: That\u2019s great. Thanks, Mike. And then maybe just a quick follow up on your guidance. Q1 certainly looks -- I mean, coming off a great Q4, Q1 looked a little bit lower than expected, but then the annual outlook was fantastic across the Board, across all metrics. So it looks like you are expecting somewhat more of a stronger back half of the year? I am just wondering if you could provide any more color on kind of assumptions for Q1 near-term versus the back half of the year?\nMike Scarpelli: Yeah. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s correct, Andrew. Q1 is actually a very strong guide relative to where consensus is and -- we are seeing strength into Q1 in our business and I think the guidance for the full year is prudent, given this is the start of the fiscal year.\nAndrew Nowinski: Okay. Very good. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks, Jimmy, and good afternoon, everybody. We finished our fiscal year with strong consumption across our customer base with 116% growth year-on-year to $178 million in fourth quarter product revenue. Remaining performance obligations of $1.3 billion grew 213% year-on-year, reflecting strengthened sales across the Board. Coupled with this rapid growth, we saw improving operating efficiency, while onboarding over 800 new employees for the year. Our growth is driven by long-term secular trends in data science and analytics, and enable by cloud scale computing and Snowflake's cloud native software architecture. With the onslaught of digital transformation, data operations become the beating heart of the modern enterprise. Customers realize that to survive and thrive they need to step up their data game given what is now possible with technology. The Snowflake Data Cloud enables breakthrough data strategies. Capacity limitations are a thing of the past. There are virtually no constraints anymore on the number of workloads that can execute at the same time against the same data. The performance of individual workloads has increased by orders of magnitude while latency has been reduced at similar proportions. The only constraints left are budgets and our customer's imagination and we believe those boundaries are shifting quickly as well. The Snowflake Data Cloud also breaks new ground in terms of data access, which is increasingly critical for data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. The days of mostly in silo analytics are numbered. The promise of data science is to discover and mobilize data relationships that can be glimpsed across a broad diversion -- diversity of data sources and data types. The physical boundaries between data sets dictated by technology legacies have no meaning or significance in data science. Science sees the world's data as a single universe that is easily seamlessly and frictionless traversed as if it was one giant database. That is the essence of the Snowflake Data Cloud, world class workload execution coupled with practically unfettered data access across clouds, cloud regions and geographies. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager has adopted the Snowflake Data Cloud to help make the best investment decisions for their clients. Last week we announced a strategic partnership to launch the Aladdin Data Cloud powered by Snowflake. Now Aladdin clients can combine Aladdin portfolio data with non-Aladdin data to analyze faster and create custom applications and dashboards. Clients will have a single control plan to make data driven positions around portfolio management, trade execution, investment operations, analysis and risk management. With Aladdin becoming a strategic part of the Snowflake Data Cloud our shared goal with BlackRock is to create a cutting edge industry standard for access and governing and acting on data in a unified and governed data environment. The data cloud is inspiring more new conversations with customers and prospects, and it leads them to a different view of the data strategies going forward. Active data showing our relationships in the Snowflake Data Cloud are growing by leaps and bounds increasing 51% quarter-on-quarter. We are seeing rapid adoption of the Snowflake marketplaces as well, with consumption attributable to data from marketplace providers up 48% quarter-over-quarter and new listings growing 10x year- on-year to a total of 380 as of the end of the fiscal year. Newly added to the marketplace in Q4 are data providers such as Zoominfo, Western Union and Foursquare. A continued push to campaign the large enterprises in the world is proving to be successful. We added 19 Fortune 500 customers in Q4, including MasterCard, Genuine Parts, Northern Trust. Our customers choose to partner with Snowflake because of the data cloud we still must meet customers wherever they are on their technology joining. Often engagements beginning with a migration of legacy data warehouse platforms. We have engaged in over 75 legacy migrations last year and we have identified many more for this year. Our Global System Integration partners or GSIs have seen their backlogs multiply and are rushing to staff, train and provision to resources to meet the demand head on. While we team up with our GSIs, our strategy is to rely on our implementation partners for much of this work. We are pleased to welcome Infosys to Snowflake Elite Partner Status during the quarter. A Fortune 100 technology company has deployed Snowflake across numerous lines of business since migrating their on-premise data warehouse platform to Snowflake, because Snowflake their marketing department tells to more informed decision-making process with 20 times faster support for their customers. For fiscal 2022, our focus is to turbocharge our Snowflake Data Cloud with massive workload execution extensions and refinements, as well as extend our date of federation with numerous new additions to the Snowflake marketplace. While our selling motions to address some of the world's smallest, as well as largest data states in the world, we will have continued emphasis on landing and expanding in the largest enterprises institutions, not just in the Americas, but also in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. To that end, we have announced new leadership in the latter region to accelerate and scale this Snowflake campaign there. A new global initiative we began last year and are now accelerating is a vertical industry focus, which is permeating our sales, marketing, alliances, product and service organizations. We have long sold almost exclusively on architectural distinction, which has served us well and we will continue to do so in situations that warranted. But our large enterprise focus has informed an evolution to go-to-market motion that is industry specific and outcome oriented. We view this as a maturation of Snowflake in a large enterprise. We also now have so much critical mass in our target verticals coupled with industry specific data marketplaces that this strategy will further differentiate Snowflake. We are super excited about the New Year. We have the technology, the talent and the organization to fully pursue our opportunity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Not really, Raimo, and things have been stable and certainly from the public cloud standpoint perfect, the course, there in terms of the comparisons with the legacy providers, no change there either. If I sort of take a global perspective on it, I would say, that I feel that our competitive position is gradually strengthening in anticipation that are the types of interactions we have with customers. We are operating far more at CEO level now than at the highest level of IT. So, there is definitely I feel an inflection there that is reflecting the relative position of the company, the marketplace, which we feel is very good. Yeah. So, in terms of sales people, I think, we are doing incredibly well and we are making a lots of changes and adjustments that are for strengthening our organization. I am sure you know that, year a half ago we separated our U.S. selling organization and enterprise, and what we call majors [ph] which are the largest 200 or so accounts and we really stepped up our staffing in that organization really, hiring the absolute best people available in the marketplace for this role. So I am really positive on that. In terms of what's changing on our go-to-market, I referenced that in the prepared remarks. I mean, we are very aggressively verticalizing our selling merchants and our general posture in accounts and we find it's very important that when we interact with customers. There's always an industry context in the conversation. We are much more outcome oriented. Customers are sometimes interested in architecture and things of that sort and comparing workloads and all of that. But increasingly when you get higher up in larger enterprises they just want to know what it means to their business, what are other people doing. So that is a significant change and we are investing literally at every level in the organization, so starting with products, moving into marketing and moving into alliances, as well as into sales and so this is a very serious effort that started last year and that will continue underway this year. Yeah. Patrick, this is Frank. I can honestly say that in my almost two years here I have never seen the legacy provider being in -- they are running for a go forward destination for the platform, if you will. So and the competition it's always moving off of legacy platforms and the competition has been very, very focused on the public cloud options. What I will say is that, we are seeing the public cloud vendors having significant struggles in terms of migrating successfully off of these legacy platforms, which of course, brings relative strength to these -- to some of these legacy providers. I think that Snowflake is really the only platform that is successfully and consistently and now at scale moving these workloads to the cloud. But to some degree your legacy providers are hanging in there longer, because if you are not going to Snowflake you are going to have a struggle on your hands. So that's sort of my commentary on that topic. No. There's a lot of partnerships out there to go after. I think that that announcement by itself triggered a whole rash of conversations both from the financial industry, as well as other industries. This whole conversation around customers building their own data cloud is really the center of their universe, the way they interact with their partners, their customers, their stakeholders is a huge idea and people are seeing the opportunity and the potential, and obviously, for BlackRock because they are the world's largest asset manager with where they were leased $21 trillion, $22 trillion of assets under management. They realized that they needed to modernize and transform to be able to continue to be in a very dominant position and it was -- from an economic standpoint it's really no different than what we are doing, in other words this is not a different line of business for us. The same product, same business practices and so on. But obviously these relationships are highly strategic to us. They come -- they become cornerstones to the Snowflake Data Cloud in the data universe, because there's this is -- this induces network effect all over the place from people that need to have access to this data or provide access. So that's a great question. So, first of all, database migrations have been hard since time immemorial. They have never been easy. They have been lengthy. They have been expensive. They have been risky. And our customers are quite leery of them as well. One of the reasons is that, while we can analyze the data with the structures, we analyze the code, we can automatically convert a lot of it and usually there is no straightforward mapping of some of the data between these databases. Now for example, you take some of the legacy flavors out there, they have proprietary artifacts that just simply do not have a counterpart in Snowflake, because Snowflake is a completely standard NNC quote environment. So that means that we have to reengineer, we have to reach the structure, we have to optimize workloads, things of that sort. The integrity of the data is absolutely everything. When you do a data migration what makes customers fearful is. They want to make sure that when the systems land on the other side they are getting exactly the same results that they were getting before. So the integrity is 100% maintained and there is not a matter of this throw on a big switch and hoping for the best. So that's a little bit of color and texture why these things are viewed as a sort of high friction. Now we are good at it, because we are experts at this. This is what we do. And we have a ton of experience doing it and that accumulated experience, as well as a lot of the tooling that we have to support these efforts, it's resulting in a very good results, a very predictable results, time wise, cost wise and outcome, so that's why. Yeah. Well, so, Brent, first of all, I mean, we are 100% committed to that and it's from a strategy standpoint it is something we absolutely have to do. When you think of data sciences, data relationships don't just exist between like data. They exist between structured and unstructured data. That's actually where a lot of the power is going to come from the type of signals that we can drive out of the data. And I think I said last time that, we are going to really substantially update the world on where we are with that as well as demonstrate at our June usual events. So, you should really expect the second half where you are going to see the real results of that strategy starting to become available in private previews and things of that sort. Well, we have relationships literally with every single business intelligence BI, vendor Tableau is definitely the largest one. But we also have -- we are going gangbusters with Power BI which is the Microsoft product also and we are going to -- we expect to see a lot of growth in that area as well. So, we are -- those relationships are really, really solid. We have a product of our own called Snowsight, which is really not meant to be so much competitive with the likes of Power BI and many of the others. That's really our homegrown if you will and better products really data analysts as opposed to for end user distribution. But listen there's no doubt that Snowflake makes these product absolutely sing. It's just a sheer scale of execution, the performance, the provisioning. So no without Snowflake it's just very difficult for these products to really have the snappy dynamic performance that users are looking for. So combination of this technology Snowflake with the entire family of the BA products out there, very, very important to deliver a good sort of end result to the customer. Yeah. So the angle they are taking is one of digital transformation. IT organizations are typically focused on what we call modernization. They are taking existing workloads. They want to move them from the on-premise environment to the cloud, but essentially take advantage of the utility model and all of that, but fundamentally running the same workloads on the platform like Snowflake. When you get to business people and CEOs, they are looking for new angles. They are looking for transformation, not just modernization. So it's often very easy to determine in these conversations whether people are after doing things differently and looking for advantage. Digital transformation plays a big role. What that means here is that, they are looking to drive signals out of their data. They are trying to define data relationships through data models that they can take advantage of. And once I can describe the data relationship I can predict it and I can even make prescriptions out of that as well. And things are going to go end-to-end digital, lights out, light speed, so it's the digital transformation is a big thing. You can think of things like really improving the efficiency and yield on marketing and sales outreach, improving service experiences, and obviously, very, very, very high scale and very, very high precision and very, very high economy on these type of processes compared to what they historically have done. The data cloud is central to these conversations. One of the things that we drive very hard is that, in future data operations are going to be very much dominated by data really moving in an orbit, where -- in other words data is flowing between partners and all kinds of stakeholders and people are able to not just analyze data in silos, but very effortlessly address data really across really a very broad orbit that includes their own data. But then external data sources data from partners, social media, IoT, structured unstructured. That's really where people are looking for significant advantage from where they historically have been. Sorry, what was it. Well, the opportunities that are central to the conversations with our bigger customers are data cloud oriented. That means establishing data networking relationships, not just internally, but especially externally. I mean, we are well on our way in our journey. I mean where we disclosed some of the growth rates in our prepared remarks. But that conversation is front and center with every single customer, everybody's trying to figure out. Historically, we have shared data through APIs and through file transfer processes copying and replicating. It's been an enormous struggle. The opportunity with Snowflake is to make this zero latency, zero friction, completely seamless. So it is an enormous game changer to what people are used to and also that goes, of course, then. Yeah. That's good question and certainly a topic that we discuss often. The big change in paradigm is that historically in on-premise data centers, people have to manage capacity. And now they don't manage capacity anymore, but they need to manage consumption. And that's a new thing for -- not for everybody but for most people -- and people that are in the public cloud. I have gotten used to the notion of consumption obviously because it applies equally to the infrastructure clouds. Now we do a lot, we have full blown chargeback capability, so that the consumers are -- of compute are and of our service and really accountable for what they do and don't do. We have hard limits, we have soft limits, we have notifications, we have dashboards. So there's a lot of ways to do this. But at the same time a very scares, people are really so motivated and inspired by the capabilities that they have. Sometimes they get a little bit out of control in terms of the amount of processing that they were planning to do and it's a very, very blunt situation. I mean we have been bottled up literally for generations and now there's a situation where there is no upper limit to how much you can do and that's intoxicating quite honestly. And we also see organizations really getting used to managing consumption and how much do we really want to allow, because often times we are very compelling reasons, why they do need to consume these services as opposed to just looking at the amount they spend. So it's manageable but it's a new discipline and it's a new mindset that everybody needs to get their head around and we provide the infrastructure and governance capabilities to do that. Yeah. Interesting thing is that a lot of the Teradata migration we have done, customers are telling us we are spending half the money and we are doing 10 times the amount of work and that may not be what you want to hear, but obviously that's a hell of a deal for them. What's really expanding the marketplace is that, historically there have been fixed capacity limits on how much work you could do and those are gone under the Snowflake platform. You can run as many workloads concurrently and you can provision those individual workloads as much as you need to. So all of a sudden it's like, hey, I don't have to wait in line for 2 a.m. slot to run my little job. It's like everything runs concurrently as much as you can possibly imagine that you want to do. Obviously, there is a financial consequence to running a ton of workloads, but there's no operational limit on that. Now what does is, it really starts to inspire people to do things they never entertain because there was not a possibility for them to ever do that. So we are sort of in this period where we are unleashing all this imagination, as well as all the backlog that has already existed that people are just rushing towards. Now because data as a driver of digital transformation, it is really the signals that fuel digital processes. It's just a very, very core component to how enterprises are evolving. So that's -- I think this market can get. We have been told by a number of our customers that we are the second largest line item in their budget behind the public cloud and that may come as a shock to some. But I am telling you that that's not going to be out of the ordinary going forward based on what we are seeing. Yeah. Probably we should bring Benoit into -- in here, let him answer that question, one of the areas that we are investing in where we have extraordinary talent that we have attracted the company as where our event driven architecture is. Today our event latency is sort of seconds and minutes, right? But you want to drive that down to sub-seconds and dramatically sub-seconds. You start to open up use cases that are just very different. That are really not approachable by a platform approach today. They really require very single purpose optimizations, right? When you think about electronic trading and all these things the latency has to be approaching zero. That obviously -- that requires tremendous optimization on our part and we are working on that because we see that as a very, very critical part of the ongoing evolution of digital transformation. We are doing a lot of stuff that is where -- what our capabilities are today are totally adequate. But we are foreseeing a world where and this has been lost at where we have to become much, much faster than what we have done so far. And certainly we have that room up, we know how to do it. So again this is going to expand the marketplace in places where these technologies historically have not been. Well, I am certainly hoping that we will break out that revenue over time. But obviously that's -- we are not there and we don't know when that will be, but you will be the first to know. What I will tell you, the data cloud conversation is so highly differentiated that's even in accounts that are completely dominated by incumbents that it reopens the conversation and we have seen that over and over and over. And so it's -- we love it, because it's just the conversation goes from just modernizing existing workloads breaking through the cloud, doing POCs benchmarking to all of a sudden we are talking about complete innovation transformation and that's inspiring for the customer, and obviously, it's great for Snowflake. We have got the accountant. In terms of verticals, media is -- media and tech are huge financial services, healthcare, life sciences, public sector and the whole replatforming going on in the software companies' data applications. So there's -- we have obviously retail consumer packaged goods is a very important vertical for us also. So we have a lot of concurrent activity going on. Most of that is really related to our customers understanding who else is on Snowflake inside their vertical. How are they using it. What are the use cases? What are the outcomes? How are they doing it? And for us to be very, very proficient. And then also in terms of what is the data marketplace and data context in that vertical data sources are they using on the outside, are they providing data, are they consuming data from the outside. So those -- that's -- those are really the conversation that we are shifting towards. I mean what are they getting out of it in terms of business benefit and outcomes and it's very, very specific to their business. So, this is a considerable shift because in the past there was always workload comparisons, POCs, benchmarks. How fast is this job running versus this query? Now, we are at a level where we are really fully engaged at the top at the house and the business itself. So, it's very great for us, because the IP selling motion, while there is nothing wrong with that, that this brings another level of strength through to our outreach."

            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Q4 was another quarter of exceptional execution and a strong finish to our first fiscal year as a publicly [Technical Difficulty]. Our Q4 product revenues were $178 million representing 116% year-over-year growth and remaining performance obligations were $1.3 billion. The outperformance of consumption spanned all verticals as we continue to see our customers deploy Snowflake across their organizations. Our strong RPO results continue to be driven by more multi-million dollar deals, as well as our customers' willingness to engage in multiyear contracts up to $1.3 billion in RPO. We expect approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. As a reminder this number is an estimate and can fluctuate significantly due to our consumption business model. The strong performance reflects Snowflakes role as both a technology solution, offering superior execution across workloads and as a strategic partner enabling digital transformation through the data cloud. We continue to invest in growth opportunities and we are now benefiting from our maturing enterprise sales efforts. In Q4 we saw the number of customers with greater than $1 million in trailing 12 months product revenue increased to 77%, up from 65% last quarter, with 12 customers are now consuming over $5 million on a trailing 12 month basis. Internationally, we have expanded our sales force across relevant geographies. We are seeing promising traction in these markets, but remain in the early stages of this opportunity. Turning to margins, on a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 70%, up 400 basis points from last year. Favorable cloud service agreements, growing scale across regions, our enterprise success and ongoing discounting discipline, all contribute to steady gross margin improvement. Our operating margin was negative 24%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and continued T&E savings. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 9%, positively impacted by strong collections with Q4 being our largest booking quarter, cash inflows relating to our employee stock purchase program and operating margin outperformance. As a reminder adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of cash paid for employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions. This quarter we saw a $10 million impact from those items. While we will continue to focus on long-term margin expansion and profitability, we do experience free cash flow seasonality in Q1 and Q4 will continue to be our strongest free cash flow quarters. We are very proud of our strong free cash flow. On a year-over-year basis, we cut our annual cash burn by 64% or $128 million or more than doubling the business. And we have implemented operations that will help us show more profitability, we are continuing to invest heavily in the business. We have ended the year in a strong cash position, with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments. This enables us to explore a number of strategic initiatives, including Snowflake Ventures, which has made several investments in the quarter, including DataRobot, Hunters, NOMA and Lacework. Our mission is to engage more organizations with the data cloud and all investments aim to drive increased consumption of Snowflake. Now, let's turn to our guidance and outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $195 million and $200 million, representing year-over-year growth between 92% and 96%. Turning to margins, we expect on a non-GAAP negative 23% operating margin and we expect $289 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $1 billion and $1.02 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 81% and 84%. Turning to profitability, we expect on a non-GAAP basis 71% product gross margins, negative 19% operating margins and breakeven adjusted free cash flow and we expect $295 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our outlook includes increased investments and FedRAMP initiatives and accelerating migrations off of legacy solutions, both of which will drive enterprise customer success. In order to support our growth initiatives, we plan on adding more than 1,200 net new employees during the year. With respect to COVID, our forecast assumes that we will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future, with an increase to potential travel expenses in the back half of the year. We are benefiting from strong productivity in our current environment and we have successfully on boarded and ramped new employees since March 2020. Well we anticipate an eventual return to the office. We do not have a specific timeline for that goal. Before closing, I'd like to know a few recent or upcoming events. Today, we announced that on March 1, 2021, our Class B shareholders in accordance with their governing documents converted all of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock eliminating the dual class structure of our common stock and ensuring that each share has an equal vote. We view this as operationally beneficial to the company and their shareholders. In addition, the restrictions under our IPO lockup expire on March 5th and almost all remaining shares not purchased in the private placement are secondary transactions concurrent with their IPO will no longer be subject to a lockup agreement. And lastly, we will host a virtual Investor Day in conjunction with Snowflake Summit our annual users' conference the week of June 7th. If you are interested in attending please email ir@snowflake.com. With that, Operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Yeah. I would say, the contracts with the cloud provider started kicking in Q3 and we had the full benefit in Q4. I don't anticipate renegotiating our cloud contracts next year. We may be in a situation at the end of the year, but I am not expecting that. It's really driven by getting more scale within our existing deployments. We have a number of deployments where we are not at scale and we see those ramping right now. As an example, like, Japan. Japan has been running at a negative gross margin, because we just don't have very many customers but we are starting to ramp there that that will turn around and that's just one example. We are in 20 deployments around the world and think of a deployment as a data center out places. But also as we move higher up into larger enterprises they tend to buy our higher addition our business critical. Yes, those big customers require more discounting, but the margin -- the contribution margin from those higher SKUs more than offset that discounting to drive gross margin, which gives us the confidence that we will get to those mid-70s, it's not going to happen next year, but we see that continued gradual improvement. Well, I would say, there was definitely an increase in average productivity per rep in terms of the number of cap one deals that they brought in on average in terms of the data sharing. I don't have any specific data on that but that is clearly a discussion point with every customer and one of the reasons why they choose to go with Snowflake. It helps the decision to go with Snowflake. That's also the fact that we are ramping. We have been adding so many reps and we have been ramping those people. Thanks. No. We are absolutely not slowing hiring down. As we just mentioned, we are going to add 1,200 people next year. Actually Q1 is a very, very big onboarding quarter. It will be probably the largest quarter of the year, because we are onboarding a lot of people in the sales and marketing organization in advance of our sales kickoff that we just had. We are investing as quickly wellbeing efficient in our business as we can. Thank you. To say it in a simpler way, Brad, that all of those Aladdin customers that want data through Aladdin, if they want to get their data the most efficient way are going to have to be Snowflake customers. Yeah. So I do expect net retention rate this year to remain very high. It should be north of 160 throughout the year is what we are -- what we see right now. In terms of average deal size landing, that is not changing that much. What's happening and because I want to stress, it takes customers especially if you are doing a legacy migration. It can take customers six months plus before we start to recognize any consumption revenue from those customers because they are doing the data migration. And what we find is so they consume very little in the first six months and then remaining six months they consume their entire contract they have. Then when we do a renewal that's when most customers are doing the multiyear renewals once they have proven the use case on Snowflake. And so I haven't seen much difference other than we are, as you know, when Frank came in here, he really started focusing more on enterprise customers. We are landing more Fortune 500 customers. We talked about we landed 19 in the quarter. But those 19 we landed, just to reiterate, we recognized virtually no revenue on those customers. That's all in the RPO that will be in the next 12 months. Thank you. Our biggest customers what are the opportunities that are pushing us into. So, number of things. A, obviously you are always going to get seasonality because that's a bookings number and obviously sales people in Q4 are going to try to maximize their acceleration there into. But it's also a function of the number of reps that we have now are ramped up. And it's also a function of the fact that we are getting into larger customers as well too and it's not just the larger new customers, it's the existing large customers with big renewals, because we are growing within those customers in the multiyear component of those customers. As I mentioned earlier, most initial what we call cap one customers are tend to be one year contracts and if the renewal and the follow on that tends to be the multiyear once they have proven they use cases. That's not always the case. That's just what we have been seeing historically. I do expect as we become a larger company, we will see more and more of those capacity when customers sign up for multiyear deals day one as well. Yeah. The interesting thing is most of the data sharing is actually externally, not internally. And one of the reasons is, if I look at some of our larger customers, they maintain a single copy of all their data and they allow their operating functions and departments and business units to execute clusters against the single copy of the data. So they are sharing data effectively because they having a single copy of the data, right? So they don't have to take advantage of our data exchanges and data sharing because they are literally sitting on the same copy of the data and that's probably will be the reason why we should have two modes of sharing. One is really tightly coupled where everybody sits on the same data and the other one is the more loosely coupled one, which is through our data sharing architecture and customers can actually mix and match. It depends on their culture and how much they want to have custody their own data and things of that sort, that sort of drives where they land on that, but the architecturally the tightest model out that we have is where there's one copies of data for the entire enterprise and anybody that wants to process against that data, they fire up their own warehouses and their own clusters and they run their own workloads and that's an extremely successful model for Snowflake and our customers. I think AWS will continue to be our largest cloud for quite some time, but we are definitely seeing a lot of large enterprise customers choosing to go with Microsoft. But you -- there were -- as I mentioned, the revenue is lagging when we book deal. So it's going to be second half of the year and even in 2020, our fiscal 2023, I think, you are going to see Azure kick up as a percentage, but we still think AWS will remain our number one cloud partner. I would just add to that Tyler that, I don't anticipate breaking out data sharing revenue any time because it will be difficult. And the reason I say that is because, the whole data sharing is going to drive people to use Snowflake because they are going to have to consume their data, but that's just a piece of their data. What they will then do is do everything on Snowflake where they are pulling their own data sources from other places. So it's all mangled together. At the end of the day, what data sharing does is it drives stickiness and it drives consumption. I would just say we gave guidance for next year and you are going to continue to see growth next year and we feel very good about what we are seeing right now, and we are not really seeing any impact on the macro in our business at all. Well. I would say 100% of that is coming from existing old customers. Because as I said, any customer we signed up in the current last fiscal year it takes them six plus months to ramp those significant customers. So, it's really coming from our existing customers and we have a number of other customers that are on the cusp of that. So we think we will continue to see that growth in million dollar plus trailing 12-month revenue customers going into next year. Yeah. I don't think that's correct, Andrew. Q1 is actually a very strong guide relative to where consensus is and -- we are seeing strength into Q1 in our business and I think the guidance for the full year is prudent, given this is the start of the fiscal year."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jimmy Sexton, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Sexton: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Snowflake's Q3 fiscal 2021 earnings call. Joining me are Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's call we will review our financial results for third quarter fiscal 2021 and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2021. During today's call we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, long-term growth and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31st, 2020, that will be filed with the SEC today. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertakes no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations. We'd also like to point out that on today's call we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to and not as a substitute to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. If you see the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release distributed earlier today in our investor presentation, which are posted at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks Jimmy, and good afternoon everybody, and thanks for joining us on our inaugural earnings call. Let's review the results. We saw strong consumption trends across our customer base in Q3, but product revenue growing 115% year-on-year to a $148 million, and a net revenue retention rate of 162%. Coupled with this rapid growth, we continue to see improving unit economics cash flow and operating efficiency. Our growth is driven by long-term secular trends in data science and analytics enabled by cloud scale computing. With the onslaught of digital transformation, data operations have become the beating heart of the modern enterprise. The pandemic has been more or less neutral to our business. Some businesses were negatively affected in terms of demand sentiment, but other stepped up their data strategy given the new complexities of the health crisis and economic effects. It bears repeating that Snowflake is not a SaaS business model. We're consumption company and our reported revenue has a direct relationship with the consumption of our platform during the period. The consumption model is variable not fixed, meaning our model place is no limits on how much of our platform, our customer can consume and this contributed to our strong revenue retention rate. The technology is now ahead of people's ability to take advantage of virtually unbounded capacity scale and performance. Over the past year Snowflake has augmented it's selling motion to campaign some of the largest enterprises and institutions in the world. Snowflake is well represented now in 8 of the Fortune 10 and we added 12 Fortune 500 customers in Q3, including Fiserv and GEICO. Interest in Snowflake is growing. We hosted our Snowflake Data Cloud Summit two weeks ago with over 40,000 registrations, up from 15,000 registrations at our Snowflake Summit in June. Shifting gears, I'd like to take a moment here and introduce you to the Snowflake Data Cloud, because it's the centerpiece of our mission and strategy. As an industry, we have struggled to mobilize our data, meaning that it has been hard to put data in the service of our enterprise and we set out to change that. As we see it, we've never had a data cloud in the history of computing. We are used to SaaS applications as application clouds in the massive infrastructure clouds like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, service and storage, you can consume by the drink. But data lives absolutely everywhere in millions of places held hostage by machines, applications, networks and clouds. We have long-needed to blend and join disparate data sets, that's why we built data warehouses in the first place. They were expensive, capacity constrained and required tons of data preparation and manipulation prior to use, only the largest most demanding data sets could afford these platforms. So they were never pervasive. Snowflake change that, drastically scaling down to the smallest jobs and radically changing the economics with a highly elastic utility model, not only did everybody know for these great powers, Snowflake also remove constraints on data volume, plus to performance and component workload execution, even high end users reported being able to cut their existing spend and expand their workloads dramatically at the same time. As compelling as Snowflake was to Turbo existing workloads, old habits die hard. Many customers are still evaluating data platforms one workload at a time, basically limiting data operations to their silos, that's like steering to ship by its wake. Future workload will look different with machine learning and data science becoming ultimate users, the workload and mentality leads to building the silos of the future. The Snowflake Data Cloud is a data universe a global data orbit, where Snowflake users effortlessly plug-in, discover, explore and access data from an incredible growing variety of sources. It's a different way of thinking about the data needs of the future. The Snowflake Data Cloud combines world-class execution with unfettered data access. Customers need both. We are seeing promising signs of adoption with already 23% of our customers using our data sharing capabilities. We also continue to on-board new data providers and in Q3, we added Standard & Poor's Global, Morningstar and Core Logic to name a few and we now have over 100 data providers on our marketplace. At the Snowflake Data Cloud Summit, we heard from customers about the impact that the Data Cloud is having on their business. The retail rewards customer has fully embraced the Data Cloud. Snowflake allows them to securely share data sets with media partners and power customer facing applications to target their end users. Commercial data providers are also turning to Snowflake to reach new customers and monetize our data, by making the data available in the Snowflake Data marketplace. Experian help retail customers accelerate their digital transformation efforts. Experian's retail customers are now reaching shoppers on aligned with insights garnered from Snowflake Data marketplace to reach customers who are no longer shopping in stores. Let's highlights some product announcements from the Snowflake Data Cloud Summit in November. First, we've grown our partnership with Salesforce. The previously announced Apple Connector is now generally available and allows customers to more easily think Salesforce data with Snowflake. Secondly, we announced Snow Park, our new developer experience. Snow Park will enable users to write code in their preferred language to build data transformations and score machine learning models, all processed by Snowflake. Third, we announced support for unstructured data. In addition to our long-standing support for structured and semi structured data. And lastly, we are enhancing our data governance strategy with the introduction of row access policies, tagging and column masking. This will help our customers control access by user type in a highly granular fashion, very important given the heightened sensitivity around data governance. These capabilities are essential to grow on the Data Cloud and you can expect more platform enhancements from us going forward. Before closing, I would like to highlight the upcoming release of our book, The Rise of the Data Cloud. We wrote this book because the Data Cloud is the centerpiece of our strategy and vision. We showcase many customers in numerous vertical industries with their Snowflake journeys and experiences. It's meant to enlighten and inspire, something we call the Art of the Possible. The book will be available on December 4th. In closing, we're pleased with the quarter and excited about the momentum coming out of the Data Cloud Summit as we head into the final quarter of our fiscal year. With that I will turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. Before I discuss our results and guidance, I would like to spend some time discussing our unique and powerful business model. We are not a SaaS model. We are a consumption model. Our business model is a key differentiator for us and is designed to drive customer success. Our customers purchase credits and when those credits are consumed, we recognize the revenue. Unlike a ratable model, we only recognize revenue, if the customer uses our platform. For this reason, there is no shelfware in our revenue. For many customers, it takes several months up until they are up and running at full capacity and this model gives them the flexibility to purchase the amount they plan on using without wasting credits or exceeding their original contract if they consume more than planned. For these reasons, we do not focus on the same metrics that the SaaS business would. We focus on product revenue and remaining performance obligation. Product revenue, which excludes professional services and other revenue is the most transparent disclosure we offer. It gives full insight into how our customers are actually using our product in the period reported. If a customer purchases credits and does not consume, their revenue will be zero dollars. We also focus on the remaining performance obligations or RPO. RPO represents all the contracted revenue not yet recognized including both deferred revenue and non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Unlike most SaaS businesses, billings is not a meaningful metric for us because it is less correlated to product revenue due to the variability of consumption. I would also like to mention that our GAAP financials will now be available on the Snowflake marketplace and we encourage al l of you to consumer financial information in a new way going forward we will be publishing our quarterly results on the marketplace in conjunction with our earnings. Now let's turn to our results in guidance. For Q3 product revenues were $148 million, representing 115% year-over-year growth. Our remaining performance obligation was $928 million representing 240% year-over-year growth with a weighted average life per multi-year contracts of 2.5 years. This strong performance is driven by our customer base realizing the value of our platform for their existing use cases, while also embracing the Snowflake Data Cloud vision. As I mentioned earlier, our business model allows our customers to consume their entire contract before the end of the term, which is what we often see. We also continue to see customers willing to make more multi-year commitments with us, which is a direct result of the value our customers can create with us as we continue to scale. We are increasingly focused on moving up market and you can see the benefits of those investments paying off. In Q3, we saw the number of customers consuming greater than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue, increased to 65, up from 31 in the same period last year. Turning to margins, on a non-GAAP basis our product gross margin was 70% positively impacted by one-time credits received from a cloud service provider in connection with our new agreements. Operating margin was negative 30% benefiting from lower than expected employee-related costs and our adjusted free cash flow margin was negative 23% positively impacted by prepayments coming in lower than expected in a stronger operating margin. Going forward, we will report and guide non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow will exclude the impact of cash paid for employer payroll tax items on employee stock transactions. This quarter, we saw a $800,000 impact from those items. For a detailed bridge of cash flow from operations to adjusted free cash flow, please refer to our investor presentation on our IR website. We ended the quarter in a strong cash position with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. This capital allows us to invest in new strategic initiatives such as Snowflake Ventures, which we announced last month. Snowflake Ventures mission is to enable more organizations to harness the power of the Data Cloud. To do this, we will invest in growth stage companies that demonstrate a commitment to mobilizing data, provide value to our customers and expand opportunities for the Data Cloud. Similarly, we will continue to evaluate strategic tuck-in opportunities in M&A focused on talent and technology, our acquisition strategy aligns with our product strategy, everything must be done the Snowflake way and that means delivering as one native product. Now, I would like to give an update on how we view COVID impacting our forecast. Our forecast assumes, our employees will continue to be working remotely for the foreseeable future. We have proven our ability to maintain productivity during the pandemic and are no rush to return back to the office in regular travel. Leveraging Zoom and other collaboration tools, we've been operating at a high level, enable to smoothly on board over 500 employees during the pandemic. We believe we will eventually be back in the office, but until we have new information and can guarantee our employee safety, we will continue to work remotely. Now let's turn to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2021. For the fourth quarter ending January 31st, 2021, we expect product revenues between $162 million and $167 million, representing year-over-year growth between 97% and 103%. Turning to margins, we expect on a non-GAAP basis, an implied 70% product gross margin, negative 30% operating margin and negative 8% adjusted free cash flow margin and we expect 283 million weighted average shares outstanding. I would like to remind everyone that because of our consumption based business model, we do not recognize revenue immediately after the deal is booked. For this reason you may not see a revenue beat flowing through to the next quarter, like you would in a ratable business model. Just because of customer consumes in a certain pattern one quarter, it does not necessarily mean they will continue those patterns going forward. For the full year fiscal 2021, we expect product revenues between $538 million and $543 million, representing year-over-year growth of between 113% and 115%. Turning to margins, we expect on a non-GAAP basis 68% product gross margin, negative 40% operating margin and negative 18% adjusted free cash flow margin, and we expect 255 million weighted average shares outstanding. With that operator, you can now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nHeather Bellini: Great, thank you very much gentlemen and congratulations on the first quarter out of the gate. I wanted to ask a little bit, you mentioned kind of keeping your employees home as a result of COVID, until things are safe, but wondering if you could share with us a little bit about what you've noticed in terms of the pace of consumption trends as the pandemic has been going on and as people prioritize moving to the cloud. Can you share with us any anecdotal data about how customers might be even accelerating their pace of a capacity usage with Snowflake? Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: Yes Heather, it's Frank. I'll give you one example. We have a data set on our Snowflake did a marketplace that's listed by a company called Star Schema, which provides detailed incident of fatality rates, very, very detailed and are updated continually. And we saw almost our entire customer base access that data within days and weeks and when that happens, it drives consumption and that access has continued to this day. So sometimes you have catalysts in specific data sets that really help customers overlay data run models, understand their demand environment better and so on. It's hard to generalize, this is just sort of a single anecdote that kind of stands out to us.\nMichael Scarpelli: I would add, Heather, that we do see in certain industries like we have some customers that are in the travel industry. We see their consumption down, but we have a lot of customers that are kind of more in the - the online consumer world that their business is booming and their consumption is much higher than we're forecasting. So it all depends upon the industry they're in, but on average we're seeing our customers consume more than we would expect. That's why we ended up beating by what we did, it was a higher beat than I was expecting for the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Congrats from me as well for the first quarter and thanks for the presentation. That was a lot of useful information in there. And Frank, question for you, you mentioned on the earlier about the data four months that you kind of dealing with and now doing also like unstructured data. Can you talk a little bit about the evolution because, when Snowflake started out, it was a very good relational cloud data warehouse and then when you guys came became much broader, can you talk a little bit like how I know - how do you see that evolving? How quickly you see customer adoption in the other areas of working with data coming through as well? And then I have one follow-up for Mike.\nFrank Slootman: Yes, sorry, the overarching theme here is that we have evolved Snowflake from being the data warehouse in the cloud to being a Cloud Data platform. And the distinction there is a much expanding scope of workloads. For those who have not been following Snowflake that long, we actually got our start processing semi structured data that was really a big differentiator for us going back to 2015-2016. Yes, but certainly structure relational data is a main stay of our business. But when you're following a Cloud Data platform strategy, what happens is that our customers are seeking broader workloads support, broader data support and we also announced couple of quarters ago, support for geospatial data on the uptake of that new data type is just enormous. So there's ferocious appetite in our customer base for us expanding the scope of our capabilities, both in terms of workloads and in terms of data types and our ability to use external services. So it's a very broadly capable platform. Customers don't want a multitude of platforms in their environment. They're very, very intent of bringing as much data as they possibly can on the Snowflake and rolling as many workloads as they can on Snowflake and we're running hard to enable that.\nRaimo Lenschow: And then Mike on gross margins, I got the 68% gross margin kind of comment you gave. Can you talk a little bit about the puts and take in terms of that in the long run? Obviously with bigger scale, you have more negotiations hour with the big cloud vendors, how is that going to change the margins going forward? Thank you.\nMichael Scarpelli: Sure. So as you saw, for the most recent quarter we just did 70% gross margin and the implied for the full year is 68%, but we're actually going to do 70% margin in Q4. As we talked about when we are going public, I do think longer term in terms of model, we can get to the mid 70s. And it's really driven by a few things, one is better pricing with our cloud vendors. We did just renegotiate deals with two of our cloud vendors AWS and Azure, who are the majority of virtually all of our businesses run in there today. And I do think, as we continue to grow, we'll be able to renegotiate those again. Scale, we have a lot of deployments around the world, we're not even close to being at scale and especially as EMEA is starting to take off for us, we'll get more scale in those which will drive better margins for us. And then also, we're seeing a lot better discipline in our field around discounting and if you see the average price per credit we're getting, it continues to increase. So those are the three things that are really going to drive that margin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: I think one for Frank and a quick follow-up for Mike here. Frank, we're starting to pick up broader interest with Snowflake in the insurance industry, which makes sense given this industry tends to be more data intensive, but I guess could you talk about the opportunity you see for Snowflake in insurance or any other vertical, maybe that stood out this quarter where you're seeing outsized traction?\nFrank Slootman: Yes, I've been involved in a lot of insurance campaigns and they're very keen on transformation more so than just modernization. Some of the - many of the larger insurance companies have very broad cross selling capabilities. They do not have the systems to - from an analytical data standpoint to support that. So they're very, very intent on sort of dislodging themselves from their - their historical on premise systems and really gained the promise of Data Sciences and machine learning and you need to have platforms like Snowflake to be able to enable that. So yes, we announced a number of insurance accounts this quarter and we love that industry that because as you said, they're very data rich. There is enormous potential for us to really digitize if you will, and really bring digital transformation to the insurance industry, so super exciting.\nBrent Bracelin: And then Mike, just as we think about the RPO momentum this quarter, I mean, much stronger than I think we had kind of thought it would be. And I know you had the benefit of a very large contract last quarter, so what drove the acceleration and kind of new bookings this quarter and that upside in RPO?\nMichael Scarpelli: As we're moving more into large enterprises, large enterprises really want to do multi-year deals. They are not interested in having to go to procurement every year and so we saw a number of large enterprises commit to multi-year deals with us and we think that is going to be a trend that will continue. And I will say it wasn't until this year that our sales force really started pushing more three-year deals and we're going to continue to do that going forward in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Colville: I mean, very impressive. Can I talk about the competitive environment in my first question, just, you know, what do you guys see, who do you see the kind of most formidable competitors right now and I guess what's happening in the on-premise world? Is that still kind of low hanging fruit?\nFrank Slootman: Yes Patrick, it's Frank. Our competitive environment is very much dominated by the public cloud vendors. I think we said that over and over and it really hasn't changed. The only time that we're dealing with on-premise environment as customers are trying to figure out how to modernize and move off of those platforms, they really are not viewed as options going forward. So it may be that our filter is biased, but where our competitive dynamic is very much centered on the three public cloud platforms that is the vast majority of competitive interaction that we have.\nMichael Scarpelli: I would say the only time we really come across the on-prem is where they - they are the incumbent and they're really not considering keeping them and they evaluating with us and the other public cloud players. That's why we don't necessarily see them as competitors, but they are definitely the incumbent in many of the cases.\nPatrick Colville: And I guess my second question is around the support for unstructured data. I mean that's a really interesting announcement. I guess what kind of used cases are you expecting, I guess in that category in the near term on the kind of things that you think customers will likely - will unstructured data will be likely start with?\nFrank Slootman: Well, for sure image data, video data, I mean PDF's, social media, by the way, this is also where our ML services are going to become, Machine Learning services they going to be really interesting because you say, I have image scans from a webcam somewhere in the city and I'm able to shoot that over to an external service, have it scanned through - that's a recognizable non-person. There's going to be enormous potential for this and we're, as I said earlier, we're getting pushed by our customers to really bring these different data types onto our platform because there it is part of the types of analytical processes that - that they want to run. So that's sort of where we see this initially going and these data types are our large. This will definitely add to the storage side of the - of the equation as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKeith Weiss: Thank you guys for taking the question. I want to talk a little bit about Snow Park, another kind of recent announcement that you guys made. One, in terms of - how does this evolve kind of the broader story in terms of overall Snowflake and sort of get more people engage with the overall platform? Then if we think about the monetization strategy for something like Snow Park? And I guess the same extents to sort of like the overall marketplace, is this all in the service just like sort of the more workload, you could get on a platform, the more consumption of that data. It just is just more compute that and that's really how you get paid on all of these?\nFrank Slootman: Yes Keith, it's Frank. Basically we're enabling a whole different range of users on the Snowflake query engine, right, I mean they are the data engineers that use the escrow language to interrogate data. And then there's a whole - another world out there that interrogate data through their language of choice, notably Java and Python, and they use things like data frames to process their data. That's a very different mode, it's highly programmatic, a lot of data transformations, a lot of machine learning type of processes are executed through these languages. So what Snow Park will do is, we will start hosting the language run times inside the Snowflake platform so it becomes - it becomes a completely optimized experience. It dramatically expands the workload scope of Snowflake. So it's a very, very important direction for us and you're correct in terms of how does this help. Our entire business model, as we said over and over is based on consumptions or anything that drives consumption of our - of our query engine in our platform accrues to our business model. So our whole strategy is driven to move the dial on consumption and this is definitely going to do it. We have many large customers who said that this is really, really important to that because, what Snowflake will bring to these environments is highly optimized efficiency in terms of the economics. Secondly, very, very highly optimized performance of performance and efficiency are high-related and the third one is super important is governance right and that is related to privacy and security. So for customers, they really want to lock down their environments from a governance standpoint with a single platform. So to the extent that we can able be workloads, where we're consolidating these workloads on the Snowflake, that's really helping them.\nKeith Weiss: And maybe if I can sneak in one follow-up, in terms of the partnerships that you guys have been signing, any one in particular that have been ramping up more aggressively than others or maybe helping you guys have said it the new customer acquisition and moving up market that we should be given the NII?\nFrank Slootman: Well, the number one, our partner that test help stimulate tons of activity has been relationship with Salesforce. And we knew that was going to happen because the Salesforce data is incredibly prominent in the Snowflake world because that data typically gets overlaid with all kinds of different types of marketing data. Salesforce is not an island and I think that's one of the reasons why our relationship with Salesforce evolved so productively because they understood that - that the data gets blend and overlaid with data coming from other sources. And that really then translates into new insight, new signals that help drive the business. So Salesforce has driven a lot of new looks and new interest in our combined offerings.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback from Stifel.\nBrad Reback: Mike, your comment earlier around less discounting, how much of that is a function of better execution in the field by the Salesforce versus customers just being much more comfortable migrating to the cloud and you've being able to take advantage of that? Thanks.\nMichael Scarpelli: I would say a lot of it is there better discipline in our Salesforce, but then also given the reference customers we have and what customers are seeing, they're more willing to move to Snowflake as well too, which makes a procurement process easier.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thank you very much.\nMichael Scarpelli: What I would also tell you today the product we're delivering today is so much better than what it was three years ago or two years ago, it continues and it becomes more the performance on it every year gets better and better. And as a result customers should pay more for it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: I'll add my congrats. Frank, where do you think we are in the cycle of COVID impacts, specifically on the new logo bookings piece? I think Chris Degnan had said recently the customers that were hesitant to start their cloud journey are moving faster now, and so it looks like a bit better quarter for your customer adds, are you feeling that incremental improvement in the new logo bookings kind of relative to where that was in the March and April timeframe?\nFrank Slootman: Yes, I think that - that the demand sentiment was stronger in this period than it was in the first half of the year, and COVID is definitely one aspect to it. I certainly think that our public markets debut also added to sort of the general energy in notoriety if you will. It just was became kind of a catalyst for a lot of people wanting to find out more and really take the relationship to the next level. So it was a tailwind in many ways and that's certainly it was one of the reasons why we wanted to take the company public is to really raise the stature of the company in the marketplace because we sell to the largest institutions enterprises in the world and we're also competing as the largest ones in the world also. So, these things are important.\nMark Murphy: As a quick follow-up, could you help us understand how aggressive your ambitions are going to be in the data science arena? You've touched on it a bit, but for building machine learning models and AI algorithms and also for handling log data or machine data, is there equal customer pull in both areas or is it stronger in one or the other?\nFrank Slootman: We do a ton of work in machine data and log data. I mean security data is growing used case that has a ton of interest and we already have very, very large deployments of those. So that's an area that is very exciting. As far as machine learning goes, what we are doing is we're really enabling our sales architecturally to really accommodate machine learning services so that we can really take advantage of all the technology that is out there. What you're not going to see from Snowflake is that we're going to go buy something and then go it alone and sort of shut out our partners. Our architecture and our strategy is very much on embracing and enabling all the capabilities that are out there. Customers have tons and tons of choice, they can - they can use ready-made services, they can use the tooling for building new services and that is in contrast to some of the competitors that we have in the marketplace. So we have very specifically chosen for that path, but we're going to be super-super active in data science is why because they're the ultimate consumer of the Snowflake cloud data platform.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens from JMP. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Walravens: Great, thank you and let me add my congratulations. So, Frank, you mentioned at the beginning that you are very focused on moving up market and I'm just wondering if you could - if you could provide some more color on what that entails from an operational perspective for you guys?\nFrank Slootman: Yes. So I - we talked about this quite a bit during the road show, when we joined the company Snowflake was mostly a sort of a commercial selling, high density relatively small contracts, but high volume and fast sales cycles, quick adoption and the company really like that model. But as coming in we just know that in order to win in markets, you have to knock down the biggest and most iconic logos and whatever city, country or region that you're in. So we really have to pivot our organization or I should say enhance the organization to layer in selling strategy and a sales motion that campaigns these very large institutions. And we went as far and we were a private company at the time of course you know we did open heart surgery on our sales organization and we separated between sales organization that campaigns the largest 250 accounts in the world and then sort of the rest of the large enterprises and then we're segment of even more on the low end also. And that's because the type of sales people that we have to hire, the type of legal contractual posture that we have, the security team that we have, the type of compensation plan that we need have, all different when you're comparing large accounts because there are long campaigns, very political, they're very challenging, requires tons of senior management involvement. So we've been working on is now for well over a year. And you know as Mike pointed out in his prepared remarks and we made a ton of progress. And we expect to become very heavily weighted over time to sort of that part of our business, because these large accounts. I mean the amount of money that they were spending just to sort of this is going to be much larger than anybody is currently really understanding, because this is becoming so important, so core to how they do things. So, yes, it's a very important shift or evolution whatever words you want to use, so that we are very aggressively oriented towards the largest companies and institutions in the world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke from Citi.\nTyler Radke: Thank you very much and congratulations on the first quarter here. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the guidance for Q4. Obviously, you saw really strong RPO growth in Q3 and I'm curious if there were any factors that had perhaps a short-term negative impact on the Q4 revenue guidance? I know oftentimes when we sign these big deals, customers through volume based discounts get effectively a lower consumption credit rate. So I'm wondering I guess it's almost the RPO strength that you saw this quarter and the large commitments that were signed, if that had any type of negative impact on your expected growth rate for revenue in Q4?\nMichael Scarpelli: No, you have to remember a lot of that RPO are new deals that we were booking. And as I said before, it takes, customers to pay, we have a lot of big on-prem migrations that are going on and until those ramp up and it could take six months plus, you don't really see any revenue from that and so most - a lot of that won't flow through until next fiscal year.\nTyler Radke: And on data sharing, I think you talked about is pretty healthy mix here, customers that are using Snowflake for data sharing. I guess a couple of questions there, what are you seeing more at this point? Is it kind of the internal data sharing use case or is it the external? I know you did talk about over 100 data providers. And then secondly, I mean, I know it's still early, but have you seen any turn, need time to trends where, yes once customers use data sharing you see consumption rise by orders of magnitude or just help us think through how much that consumption potential is once - once customers move over to a data sharing in this case?\nFrank Slootman: Tyle, it's Frank. The important thing to understand is that gaining and providing data access to external sources or whether they are inside an institution or whether they're external is becoming a main part of data operations. Historically, it hasn't been, I mean, we never used file transfer protocols, APIs to move data from ADB, it was logistically incredibly hard, it was very governance challenges. People did it because they had to, but they absolutely didn't like it. So here comes Snowflake with a frictionless seamless data sharing model in all of the sudden is like, hey part of our data operations is that we both gained and provide access to in the case of large financial institutions, there are hundreds and hundreds of data sets that they - that they gain access to and provide access to. So data sharing is part of data operations, where we're just for the first time now really providing an extremely strong model - operational model to be able to do that and I know historically people just didn't do as much of this because it was so damn hard. Now I will tell you that job one for most of our customers is, well, first, I got to get my data to the cloud, then I got do to database migrations, which is - which is really the biggest part of the transition. This is just modernization and then you know we start thinking about transformations in terms of running processes that we've never run before, things that are now possible that couldn't be done before. And typically, data sharing is sort of the Frontier if you will of the new things that are now possible that people had never even considered before. I mean it was not even an option and they were so preoccupied with just doing things in terms of blocking and tackling, but they had never gotten around to really fully examining and understanding and what is now possible. So it's usually - data sharing is usually not the first part of the conversation. It's something that's sort of evolves over time and what we are seeing though is that where we're now getting into deals - deals where people already have strong incumbents on the cloud relative to existing workloads. And the Data Cloud and our data sharing capabilities are busting open accounts, as you are aware normally on a workload basis, we would not really have that much opportunity or to customer incentive to even look at it. So the Salesforce loves that about this conversation, where we're hitting 1,000. Okay, that never fails to trigger new interest. So we like it for all of those reasons.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Again congrats on the great quarter out of the gate. Couple of questions from me. Maybe one for you first, Frank. When I go back to the machine learning comments you made earlier, I just want to make sure I understand this and get this right? Do you intend or not intend on moving into the machine learning algorithm space like data bricks or data robot? I want to make sure I understand your interaction with machine learning. Do you want to be an enabler or are you actually going to provide a full stack platform for machine learning?\nFrank Slootman: Well, we're going to do both. What I did say was, like we don't want to sort of want to go to the marketplace and say we're going to have to use our and that said, there are enough people that operate in that mode. So we're going to have a much richer, wider, broader set of choices for customers. Certainly, what - my comments about Snow Park, I mean, considering that we're going to have Java, Python language run times in our platform, that's going to be a key enabler for people to develop these kind of capabilities and used to kind of capabilities that they're already using today. So it really bring those workloads that already - that already exist or that are being newly developed to bring that inside the Snowflake platform. So we're not going to be a company where we have our own flavor of everything and our partners are all going to be secondary. We want to actively encourage development on our platform, participation on our platform, because again we're consumption company. So the way we drive our strategy is to drive activity on our platform, right. I mean, if we get activity in our platform, whether our product drives it or/and other product drives it, it yields the same result, right. So we'd be crazy to - because the way our model works, we don't have to prioritize our own product.\nIttai Kidron: And maybe flipping into the other side of the chain then, clearly your economics get much better and better, the more and more data resides on your platform. And so moving data into your platform is absolutely critical for you, how do you think about the data integration layer, which is highly fragmented and has multiple layers to it? How far down the data integration side, do you want to move in order to enable better and faster and smoother movement of data into the platform/\nFrank Slootman: Well, the data engineering side of our business is already a huge part of our drive to consumption on our platform. And everything that we're doing with Snow Park is obviously focused on that as well because so much of that work is going to be data transformation oriented. So, no, it's a huge thing. But we're going to do things that are - that are Snowflake optimized, right, and sort of processes that run all the way from - from ingestion and transformation and bringing data on the platform, running analytical process to make that as seamless and as frictionless as possible, and our partners in the ecosystem, they serve many mastered, we only serve one that Snowflake.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Go ahead.\nGregg Moskowitz: I'll add my congratulations as well. I wanted to go back, if I could to the topic of bringing on structured data into the Snowflake platform. Frank, as you mentioned Snowflake began its life as a semi structured data company, and I'm curious how much of a technical challenge it is or has been for you to support and the transact on images, videos, PDF's et cetera and to do so at scale/\nFrank Slootman: Well, it's obviously is not a no-brainer. Otherwise, we probably would have done it a long time ago. But we - our technical teams are now heavily invested in making this happen. I mean our announcement was - was very much the very first time, we've talked about this openly. I expect that in our next Snowflake summer event, which is in June of next year, we will have extensive technical details and presentations on this topic. So we'll be communicating on this topic in full detail at that time. We're certainly not prepared ready to do it right now.\nGregg Moskowitz: Look forward to that. And then just as a follow-up. So 23% of customers already using data sharing, really impressive for a service that frankly hasn't been available all that long. How does this uptake compared to what your expectations were at this stage? And then also where can this go longer term?\nFrank Slootman: Yes, I think - I think longer term, I mean, I think everybody is going to be doing. As I said earlier, this is going to become core to data operations. This has held the whole notion of a Data Cloud is, you're not just running Data Sciences against your own data silos, you're going to be running it across disparate data sets, meaning data that lives inside of your world, outside of your world, that's really what data science is all about is to - is to build these highly descriptive models that can then we used predictably and prescriptively to really get closer to business outcomes. So in order for the Data Cloud to really happen as a concept, this is going to become incredibly mainstream. That is our general strategic assumption about data. It is not going to stay where it has been historically, because we were essentially encumbered by technology and we're not anymore, it's wide open. So I think customers are learning and slowly sort of gaining an appreciation what all the new possibilities are. I mean, I said in my prepared remarks, technology is not well ahead of people's ability to use it, right. When people are scratching their heads like, wow, this is this is just unbelievable the scale, the scope, the power that we have. How do we use it? And that's sort of where we are. Really exciting, but nobody sort of have the playbook ready to throw at it. So it's a bit of a journey that - that we're on, everybody will be on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen & Company.\nDerrick Wood: My first question I wanted to ask about a couple of different regions. First on Europe, I think you guys have been building out major accounts focus there, would love to hear about how that's tracking versus kind of what you've been experiencing in the US? And then in the US regarding the Fed, I think you guys have received some new FedRAMP certification this year. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the opportunity with the government looking out over the next couple of years?\nFrank Slootman: Yes, we had a really good quarter in Europe. We're very excited about that. Europe was definitely a region where we have to sort of re-rack ourselves in terms of our large account orientation. I mean Europe is even more sensitive to a major account campaigning because that's sort of how these markets operate. They really look through their own iconic enterprises to see what kind of decisions they're making and the whole market kind of follow. So you simply cannot afford to be in those markets and not campaign as large enterprises. So a fairly substantial sort of I reboot for us to be able to have that posture, but where we're seeing it pay off, and I have very high expectations and how up for Europe and we're going to be spending time there when we can travel again to help campaign those institutions. It's a very, very good opportunity. As far as the Fed goes, the hard part about federal government is always getting them on the cloud. They have historically been incredibly slow to move to the cloud for all kinds of reasons. So the FedRAMP certifications, that we have - we have achieved some certification that are helping. We need higher level of certifications to really enable that business further. And that is really sort of the gating factor, if you will, for the Fed really becoming a solid contributor to the business, which they're not yet.\nDerrick Wood: And then maybe one for Mike. You had a nice rebound in net revenue retention rates, but it has bumped throughout a bunch over the last few quarters. So can you just walk us through the mechanical drivers in terms of what you see in the last couple of quarters and maybe how to think about how you see those number of settling out over the next couple of quarters.\nMichael Scarpelli: Well, when we were going public, we had mentioned that we fully expect it would be above 160% this quarter. So kind of came into where we were expecting. These are extremely high net revenue retention rates. I think over time it will come down, but I'm not expecting a steep decline and I think it's going to be pretty stable for the next little while. It's not something we're going to be guiding to. I just knew after last quarter that this quarter was going to go higher because of the cohort that has just come in from the two-year ago period, that it was just the nature of some of those customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nGray Powell: Great, thanks for taking the questions. And yes, I'll let go my congratulations on the - on the results. So maybe a couple of questions for Mike. As you look at your growth forecast over the next 12 months, how much of it do you feel like you have visibility on from the installed base today, the customers you just won and natural growth in usage and then how much do you think you have to - to go out and win?\nMichael Scarpelli: First of all, going into a quarter, virtually all of our revenue is coming from our existing customers, very little comes from customers that are landed in the quarter and it's less than 5% come from our on-demand customers. Over the next 12 months, it's still the vast majority of our revenue is coming from our existing customers that we have and we do see the growth in those customers. Sure. We need to sell them more, but most of our growth is coming from our existing customers over the next 12 months. Longer term it's super important that we acquire new customers, because those will be the growth drivers in two to three years or so.\nGray Powell: And I just want to make sure I'm thinking about the Q4 guidance correctly. So if I just look at the last few quarters, product revenue increased by about $23 million sequentially in both Q2 and Q3. I would think that usage is seasonally stronger in Q4. So is there any reason why product revenue would only grow by $16 million sequentially in the quarter? Or just how should I - how should we think through that?\nMichael Scarpelli: No, it all depends upon the type of customer you are and depending upon what you're doing. There is also a number of our large customers that we've given that are getting more mature right now too and their growth has slowed down somewhat with some of these large customers, but there is seasonality within our customer base and I would not assume Q4 what's driving their consumption at all. Quite frankly, in Q4, there's a lot of holidays. You have Thanksgiving, you have Christmas and you do see decrease in the New Year. You do see decreases because employees aren't in the office driving analytics.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Hynes from Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nDavid Hynes: I want to ask a follow-up on the strong net revenue expansion. Frank, when you talk to CIOs, at some of your larger customers, I'm curious if you pick up any concern about the pace at which the Snowflake spend is growing? Or is it still that such price disparity versus the incumbents that it's not an issue. I'm curious kind of how you think about balancing that in a consumption based model?\nFrank Slootman: So here's the important thing, I already mentioned it a little bit earlier. So it's not like it's a variable period, right. In other words, this is not fixed. People can't consume as much and as low as they have appetite and budget for, which is why you have this buoyancy in net revenue retention rate because people - because they now can. They start doing things that they could not do before. The big thing and by the way it's not CIOs that are - that are upset, it's usually CFOs that are...\nDavid Hynes: I understand.\nFrank Slootman: How you go from one period to the next and the number has doubled, but the business is telling them no, we need to do this. So people are getting used to spending way more money on this class of service than they ever imagined, and the reason is, they now can and they now need to right. Now, does that take time. Yes, it takes time for people to get used to that. I mean I've talked to CTOs, they've said we spent $50,000 last year, we're spending $1 million this year. How do I explain that. Well, you know, that is - those are the types of transitions that we're going through. We have customers where we are the second largest line item behind Amazon, AWS, right. Well, that's we're getting used to for customer that you're spending on a service like this at this rate, but when data becomes the beating heart of your enterprise, it makes total sense. It's just, it doesn't make sense in a historical context and it takes time for us to transition to this realization that like this is pretty damned important and that's sort of where it sometimes it goes a little bit too quick. People are like holy-moly this thing is a little bit too slick and too fast and it's just too easy to fire up a cluster of warehouse and still are running this process once a week. We're now running at every night, because they see advantage in doing it, right. But we're seeing people getting used to large numbers, I mean I'm quite honestly in my own history and software, I'm just stunned by the size of the relationships that we're seeing in this business and it's - it's an amazing thing, but it does take time for people to really transitioned to the realization that this is going to have a big economic footprint.\nDavid Hynes: Yes, yes, It makes sense. Obviously, good problems to have. Maybe one quick follow-up if I could. We've talked about the network effects that come from the data exchange, in the near term, what's more important on that front in your view. Is it getting more customers to participate or is it getting more data providers on the network?\nFrank Slootman: Yes, I don't know that we need to trade those off quite honestly. We can walk and chew gum, if you will. So we're operating on both those vectors at the same time. In terms of data providers, it's sometimes more of a qualitative than a quantitative thing because they're not all created equal. So some of those and by the way it's very vertically oriented in the types of data that we're dealing with. So it's a fairly nuance thing. It's very important for us that we enrich the Data Cloud with new data out all the time because there are going to be more and more customers who - the reason to be on Snowflake is not just a world-class execution capabilities that we have, but they need to be there because their partners, their data providers are there, that after a while starts to break the bow, because it becomes a no-brainer. But we have to have both, if you don't have that workload execution capabilities, the data richness will not save you, you need to have both.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies.\nBrent Thill: Just on the go-to-market as we go into next year in terms of your quota carrying sales capacity in your build out, how are you thinking about what you're adding to the system? Are you accelerating the build out here given what you're seeing with the economy, starting to stabilize a little bit or are you just maybe walk us through your thoughts and how you're thinking through the shape of that go to market?\nMichael Scarpelli: Well, what I would say is we're very much focused on first on geography, EMEA is one that we're investing very heavily in and adding a fair number of people there as a percent of what they have. We're clearly focused on going after the largest enterprises in the world and so we are continuing to add perhaps there. I would say, we really never slowed down given what was happening in the economy. You can see that year-over-year in Q3 of 2020, we had 900 people in our sales organization and we've added roughly almost 300 people into our sales organization over that period of time of year. And we will continue to add at that similar pace going forward next year. I would say the other area, we're really adding as we get more into the major accounts, we're adding a lot more SCs into our organization because majors require more one-to-one relationship where in the past, we never did. So I would say is we are really going after those larger accounts and enterprise more so than SMB.\nFrank Slootman: Yes, the only thing I'll add to that is that is - we're also on a massive push to drive verticalization and in our selling motions. And that means that quota is going to be overlaid and added by vertical as well. So you will see our capacity to sell will grow and it's really nice that we have - we have a geographically, we have it by large enterprise accounts and we're going to have it by vertical. So we're very excited about the company verticalizing, because we're having great business in the technology side, in the media side, retail consumer buckets, goods health care. So that's where lot of our selling capacity is going to grow in the coming years.\nMichael Scarpelli: And I'll add Brent to that, we've really been focused in the last 12 months on the system integrators and the global system integrators, who we're adding more people there, the likes of Deloitte and Accenture building a real practices around Snowflake and we're going to continue to invest in those because they are starting to drive meaningful business to us.\nOperator: And that was our last question. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Scarpelli",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Before I discuss our results and guidance, I would like to spend some time discussing our unique and powerful business model. We are not a SaaS model. We are a consumption model. Our business model is a key differentiator for us and is designed to drive customer success. Our customers purchase credits and when those credits are consumed, we recognize the revenue. Unlike a ratable model, we only recognize revenue, if the customer uses our platform. For this reason, there is no shelfware in our revenue. For many customers, it takes several months up until they are up and running at full capacity and this model gives them the flexibility to purchase the amount they plan on using without wasting credits or exceeding their original contract if they consume more than planned. For these reasons, we do not focus on the same metrics that the SaaS business would. We focus on product revenue and remaining performance obligation. Product revenue, which excludes professional services and other revenue is the most transparent disclosure we offer. It gives full insight into how our customers are actually using our product in the period reported. If a customer purchases credits and does not consume, their revenue will be zero dollars. We also focus on the remaining performance obligations or RPO. RPO represents all the contracted revenue not yet recognized including both deferred revenue and non-cancelable contracted amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Unlike most SaaS businesses, billings is not a meaningful metric for us because it is less correlated to product revenue due to the variability of consumption. I would also like to mention that our GAAP financials will now be available on the Snowflake marketplace and we encourage al l of you to consumer financial information in a new way going forward we will be publishing our quarterly results on the marketplace in conjunction with our earnings. Now let's turn to our results in guidance. For Q3 product revenues were $148 million, representing 115% year-over-year growth. Our remaining performance obligation was $928 million representing 240% year-over-year growth with a weighted average life per multi-year contracts of 2.5 years. This strong performance is driven by our customer base realizing the value of our platform for their existing use cases, while also embracing the Snowflake Data Cloud vision. As I mentioned earlier, our business model allows our customers to consume their entire contract before the end of the term, which is what we often see. We also continue to see customers willing to make more multi-year commitments with us, which is a direct result of the value our customers can create with us as we continue to scale. We are increasingly focused on moving up market and you can see the benefits of those investments paying off. In Q3, we saw the number of customers consuming greater than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue, increased to 65, up from 31 in the same period last year. Turning to margins, on a non-GAAP basis our product gross margin was 70% positively impacted by one-time credits received from a cloud service provider in connection with our new agreements. Operating margin was negative 30% benefiting from lower than expected employee-related costs and our adjusted free cash flow margin was negative 23% positively impacted by prepayments coming in lower than expected in a stronger operating margin. Going forward, we will report and guide non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow will exclude the impact of cash paid for employer payroll tax items on employee stock transactions. This quarter, we saw a $800,000 impact from those items. For a detailed bridge of cash flow from operations to adjusted free cash flow, please refer to our investor presentation on our IR website. We ended the quarter in a strong cash position with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. This capital allows us to invest in new strategic initiatives such as Snowflake Ventures, which we announced last month. Snowflake Ventures mission is to enable more organizations to harness the power of the Data Cloud. To do this, we will invest in growth stage companies that demonstrate a commitment to mobilizing data, provide value to our customers and expand opportunities for the Data Cloud. Similarly, we will continue to evaluate strategic tuck-in opportunities in M&A focused on talent and technology, our acquisition strategy aligns with our product strategy, everything must be done the Snowflake way and that means delivering as one native product. Now, I would like to give an update on how we view COVID impacting our forecast. Our forecast assumes, our employees will continue to be working remotely for the foreseeable future. We have proven our ability to maintain productivity during the pandemic and are no rush to return back to the office in regular travel. Leveraging Zoom and other collaboration tools, we've been operating at a high level, enable to smoothly on board over 500 employees during the pandemic. We believe we will eventually be back in the office, but until we have new information and can guarantee our employee safety, we will continue to work remotely. Now let's turn to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2021. For the fourth quarter ending January 31st, 2021, we expect product revenues between $162 million and $167 million, representing year-over-year growth between 97% and 103%. Turning to margins, we expect on a non-GAAP basis, an implied 70% product gross margin, negative 30% operating margin and negative 8% adjusted free cash flow margin and we expect 283 million weighted average shares outstanding. I would like to remind everyone that because of our consumption based business model, we do not recognize revenue immediately after the deal is booked. For this reason you may not see a revenue beat flowing through to the next quarter, like you would in a ratable business model. Just because of customer consumes in a certain pattern one quarter, it does not necessarily mean they will continue those patterns going forward. For the full year fiscal 2021, we expect product revenues between $538 million and $543 million, representing year-over-year growth of between 113% and 115%. Turning to margins, we expect on a non-GAAP basis 68% product gross margin, negative 40% operating margin and negative 18% adjusted free cash flow margin, and we expect 255 million weighted average shares outstanding. With that operator, you can now open the line for questions. I would add, Heather, that we do see in certain industries like we have some customers that are in the travel industry. We see their consumption down, but we have a lot of customers that are kind of more in the - the online consumer world that their business is booming and their consumption is much higher than we're forecasting. So it all depends upon the industry they're in, but on average we're seeing our customers consume more than we would expect. That's why we ended up beating by what we did, it was a higher beat than I was expecting for the quarter. Sure. So as you saw, for the most recent quarter we just did 70% gross margin and the implied for the full year is 68%, but we're actually going to do 70% margin in Q4. As we talked about when we are going public, I do think longer term in terms of model, we can get to the mid 70s. And it's really driven by a few things, one is better pricing with our cloud vendors. We did just renegotiate deals with two of our cloud vendors AWS and Azure, who are the majority of virtually all of our businesses run in there today. And I do think, as we continue to grow, we'll be able to renegotiate those again. Scale, we have a lot of deployments around the world, we're not even close to being at scale and especially as EMEA is starting to take off for us, we'll get more scale in those which will drive better margins for us. And then also, we're seeing a lot better discipline in our field around discounting and if you see the average price per credit we're getting, it continues to increase. So those are the three things that are really going to drive that margin. As we're moving more into large enterprises, large enterprises really want to do multi-year deals. They are not interested in having to go to procurement every year and so we saw a number of large enterprises commit to multi-year deals with us and we think that is going to be a trend that will continue. And I will say it wasn't until this year that our sales force really started pushing more three-year deals and we're going to continue to do that going forward in the future. I would say the only time we really come across the on-prem is where they - they are the incumbent and they're really not considering keeping them and they evaluating with us and the other public cloud players. That's why we don't necessarily see them as competitors, but they are definitely the incumbent in many of the cases. I would say a lot of it is there better discipline in our Salesforce, but then also given the reference customers we have and what customers are seeing, they're more willing to move to Snowflake as well too, which makes a procurement process easier. What I would also tell you today the product we're delivering today is so much better than what it was three years ago or two years ago, it continues and it becomes more the performance on it every year gets better and better. And as a result customers should pay more for it. No, you have to remember a lot of that RPO are new deals that we were booking. And as I said before, it takes, customers to pay, we have a lot of big on-prem migrations that are going on and until those ramp up and it could take six months plus, you don't really see any revenue from that and so most - a lot of that won't flow through until next fiscal year. Well, when we were going public, we had mentioned that we fully expect it would be above 160% this quarter. So kind of came into where we were expecting. These are extremely high net revenue retention rates. I think over time it will come down, but I'm not expecting a steep decline and I think it's going to be pretty stable for the next little while. It's not something we're going to be guiding to. I just knew after last quarter that this quarter was going to go higher because of the cohort that has just come in from the two-year ago period, that it was just the nature of some of those customers. First of all, going into a quarter, virtually all of our revenue is coming from our existing customers, very little comes from customers that are landed in the quarter and it's less than 5% come from our on-demand customers. Over the next 12 months, it's still the vast majority of our revenue is coming from our existing customers that we have and we do see the growth in those customers. Sure. We need to sell them more, but most of our growth is coming from our existing customers over the next 12 months. Longer term it's super important that we acquire new customers, because those will be the growth drivers in two to three years or so. No, it all depends upon the type of customer you are and depending upon what you're doing. There is also a number of our large customers that we've given that are getting more mature right now too and their growth has slowed down somewhat with some of these large customers, but there is seasonality within our customer base and I would not assume Q4 what's driving their consumption at all. Quite frankly, in Q4, there's a lot of holidays. You have Thanksgiving, you have Christmas and you do see decrease in the New Year. You do see decreases because employees aren't in the office driving analytics. Well, what I would say is we're very much focused on first on geography, EMEA is one that we're investing very heavily in and adding a fair number of people there as a percent of what they have. We're clearly focused on going after the largest enterprises in the world and so we are continuing to add perhaps there. I would say, we really never slowed down given what was happening in the economy. You can see that year-over-year in Q3 of 2020, we had 900 people in our sales organization and we've added roughly almost 300 people into our sales organization over that period of time of year. And we will continue to add at that similar pace going forward next year. I would say the other area, we're really adding as we get more into the major accounts, we're adding a lot more SCs into our organization because majors require more one-to-one relationship where in the past, we never did. So I would say is we are really going after those larger accounts and enterprise more so than SMB. And I'll add Brent to that, we've really been focused in the last 12 months on the system integrators and the global system integrators, who we're adding more people there, the likes of Deloitte and Accenture building a real practices around Snowflake and we're going to continue to invest in those because they are starting to drive meaningful business to us."

            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks Jimmy, and good afternoon everybody, and thanks for joining us on our inaugural earnings call. Let's review the results. We saw strong consumption trends across our customer base in Q3, but product revenue growing 115% year-on-year to a $148 million, and a net revenue retention rate of 162%. Coupled with this rapid growth, we continue to see improving unit economics cash flow and operating efficiency. Our growth is driven by long-term secular trends in data science and analytics enabled by cloud scale computing. With the onslaught of digital transformation, data operations have become the beating heart of the modern enterprise. The pandemic has been more or less neutral to our business. Some businesses were negatively affected in terms of demand sentiment, but other stepped up their data strategy given the new complexities of the health crisis and economic effects. It bears repeating that Snowflake is not a SaaS business model. We're consumption company and our reported revenue has a direct relationship with the consumption of our platform during the period. The consumption model is variable not fixed, meaning our model place is no limits on how much of our platform, our customer can consume and this contributed to our strong revenue retention rate. The technology is now ahead of people's ability to take advantage of virtually unbounded capacity scale and performance. Over the past year Snowflake has augmented it's selling motion to campaign some of the largest enterprises and institutions in the world. Snowflake is well represented now in 8 of the Fortune 10 and we added 12 Fortune 500 customers in Q3, including Fiserv and GEICO. Interest in Snowflake is growing. We hosted our Snowflake Data Cloud Summit two weeks ago with over 40,000 registrations, up from 15,000 registrations at our Snowflake Summit in June. Shifting gears, I'd like to take a moment here and introduce you to the Snowflake Data Cloud, because it's the centerpiece of our mission and strategy. As an industry, we have struggled to mobilize our data, meaning that it has been hard to put data in the service of our enterprise and we set out to change that. As we see it, we've never had a data cloud in the history of computing. We are used to SaaS applications as application clouds in the massive infrastructure clouds like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, service and storage, you can consume by the drink. But data lives absolutely everywhere in millions of places held hostage by machines, applications, networks and clouds. We have long-needed to blend and join disparate data sets, that's why we built data warehouses in the first place. They were expensive, capacity constrained and required tons of data preparation and manipulation prior to use, only the largest most demanding data sets could afford these platforms. So they were never pervasive. Snowflake change that, drastically scaling down to the smallest jobs and radically changing the economics with a highly elastic utility model, not only did everybody know for these great powers, Snowflake also remove constraints on data volume, plus to performance and component workload execution, even high end users reported being able to cut their existing spend and expand their workloads dramatically at the same time. As compelling as Snowflake was to Turbo existing workloads, old habits die hard. Many customers are still evaluating data platforms one workload at a time, basically limiting data operations to their silos, that's like steering to ship by its wake. Future workload will look different with machine learning and data science becoming ultimate users, the workload and mentality leads to building the silos of the future. The Snowflake Data Cloud is a data universe a global data orbit, where Snowflake users effortlessly plug-in, discover, explore and access data from an incredible growing variety of sources. It's a different way of thinking about the data needs of the future. The Snowflake Data Cloud combines world-class execution with unfettered data access. Customers need both. We are seeing promising signs of adoption with already 23% of our customers using our data sharing capabilities. We also continue to on-board new data providers and in Q3, we added Standard & Poor's Global, Morningstar and Core Logic to name a few and we now have over 100 data providers on our marketplace. At the Snowflake Data Cloud Summit, we heard from customers about the impact that the Data Cloud is having on their business. The retail rewards customer has fully embraced the Data Cloud. Snowflake allows them to securely share data sets with media partners and power customer facing applications to target their end users. Commercial data providers are also turning to Snowflake to reach new customers and monetize our data, by making the data available in the Snowflake Data marketplace. Experian help retail customers accelerate their digital transformation efforts. Experian's retail customers are now reaching shoppers on aligned with insights garnered from Snowflake Data marketplace to reach customers who are no longer shopping in stores. Let's highlights some product announcements from the Snowflake Data Cloud Summit in November. First, we've grown our partnership with Salesforce. The previously announced Apple Connector is now generally available and allows customers to more easily think Salesforce data with Snowflake. Secondly, we announced Snow Park, our new developer experience. Snow Park will enable users to write code in their preferred language to build data transformations and score machine learning models, all processed by Snowflake. Third, we announced support for unstructured data. In addition to our long-standing support for structured and semi structured data. And lastly, we are enhancing our data governance strategy with the introduction of row access policies, tagging and column masking. This will help our customers control access by user type in a highly granular fashion, very important given the heightened sensitivity around data governance. These capabilities are essential to grow on the Data Cloud and you can expect more platform enhancements from us going forward. Before closing, I would like to highlight the upcoming release of our book, The Rise of the Data Cloud. We wrote this book because the Data Cloud is the centerpiece of our strategy and vision. We showcase many customers in numerous vertical industries with their Snowflake journeys and experiences. It's meant to enlighten and inspire, something we call the Art of the Possible. The book will be available on December 4th. In closing, we're pleased with the quarter and excited about the momentum coming out of the Data Cloud Summit as we head into the final quarter of our fiscal year. With that I will turn the call over to Mike. Yes Heather, it's Frank. I'll give you one example. We have a data set on our Snowflake did a marketplace that's listed by a company called Star Schema, which provides detailed incident of fatality rates, very, very detailed and are updated continually. And we saw almost our entire customer base access that data within days and weeks and when that happens, it drives consumption and that access has continued to this day. So sometimes you have catalysts in specific data sets that really help customers overlay data run models, understand their demand environment better and so on. It's hard to generalize, this is just sort of a single anecdote that kind of stands out to us. Yes, sorry, the overarching theme here is that we have evolved Snowflake from being the data warehouse in the cloud to being a Cloud Data platform. And the distinction there is a much expanding scope of workloads. For those who have not been following Snowflake that long, we actually got our start processing semi structured data that was really a big differentiator for us going back to 2015-2016. Yes, but certainly structure relational data is a main stay of our business. But when you're following a Cloud Data platform strategy, what happens is that our customers are seeking broader workloads support, broader data support and we also announced couple of quarters ago, support for geospatial data on the uptake of that new data type is just enormous. So there's ferocious appetite in our customer base for us expanding the scope of our capabilities, both in terms of workloads and in terms of data types and our ability to use external services. So it's a very broadly capable platform. Customers don't want a multitude of platforms in their environment. They're very, very intent of bringing as much data as they possibly can on the Snowflake and rolling as many workloads as they can on Snowflake and we're running hard to enable that. Yes, I've been involved in a lot of insurance campaigns and they're very keen on transformation more so than just modernization. Some of the - many of the larger insurance companies have very broad cross selling capabilities. They do not have the systems to - from an analytical data standpoint to support that. So they're very, very intent on sort of dislodging themselves from their - their historical on premise systems and really gained the promise of Data Sciences and machine learning and you need to have platforms like Snowflake to be able to enable that. So yes, we announced a number of insurance accounts this quarter and we love that industry that because as you said, they're very data rich. There is enormous potential for us to really digitize if you will, and really bring digital transformation to the insurance industry, so super exciting. Yes Patrick, it's Frank. Our competitive environment is very much dominated by the public cloud vendors. I think we said that over and over and it really hasn't changed. The only time that we're dealing with on-premise environment as customers are trying to figure out how to modernize and move off of those platforms, they really are not viewed as options going forward. So it may be that our filter is biased, but where our competitive dynamic is very much centered on the three public cloud platforms that is the vast majority of competitive interaction that we have. Well, for sure image data, video data, I mean PDF's, social media, by the way, this is also where our ML services are going to become, Machine Learning services they going to be really interesting because you say, I have image scans from a webcam somewhere in the city and I'm able to shoot that over to an external service, have it scanned through - that's a recognizable non-person. There's going to be enormous potential for this and we're, as I said earlier, we're getting pushed by our customers to really bring these different data types onto our platform because there it is part of the types of analytical processes that - that they want to run. So that's sort of where we see this initially going and these data types are our large. This will definitely add to the storage side of the - of the equation as well. Yes Keith, it's Frank. Basically we're enabling a whole different range of users on the Snowflake query engine, right, I mean they are the data engineers that use the escrow language to interrogate data. And then there's a whole - another world out there that interrogate data through their language of choice, notably Java and Python, and they use things like data frames to process their data. That's a very different mode, it's highly programmatic, a lot of data transformations, a lot of machine learning type of processes are executed through these languages. So what Snow Park will do is, we will start hosting the language run times inside the Snowflake platform so it becomes - it becomes a completely optimized experience. It dramatically expands the workload scope of Snowflake. So it's a very, very important direction for us and you're correct in terms of how does this help. Our entire business model, as we said over and over is based on consumptions or anything that drives consumption of our - of our query engine in our platform accrues to our business model. So our whole strategy is driven to move the dial on consumption and this is definitely going to do it. We have many large customers who said that this is really, really important to that because, what Snowflake will bring to these environments is highly optimized efficiency in terms of the economics. Secondly, very, very highly optimized performance of performance and efficiency are high-related and the third one is super important is governance right and that is related to privacy and security. So for customers, they really want to lock down their environments from a governance standpoint with a single platform. So to the extent that we can able be workloads, where we're consolidating these workloads on the Snowflake, that's really helping them. Well, the number one, our partner that test help stimulate tons of activity has been relationship with Salesforce. And we knew that was going to happen because the Salesforce data is incredibly prominent in the Snowflake world because that data typically gets overlaid with all kinds of different types of marketing data. Salesforce is not an island and I think that's one of the reasons why our relationship with Salesforce evolved so productively because they understood that - that the data gets blend and overlaid with data coming from other sources. And that really then translates into new insight, new signals that help drive the business. So Salesforce has driven a lot of new looks and new interest in our combined offerings. Yes, I think that - that the demand sentiment was stronger in this period than it was in the first half of the year, and COVID is definitely one aspect to it. I certainly think that our public markets debut also added to sort of the general energy in notoriety if you will. It just was became kind of a catalyst for a lot of people wanting to find out more and really take the relationship to the next level. So it was a tailwind in many ways and that's certainly it was one of the reasons why we wanted to take the company public is to really raise the stature of the company in the marketplace because we sell to the largest institutions enterprises in the world and we're also competing as the largest ones in the world also. So, these things are important. We do a ton of work in machine data and log data. I mean security data is growing used case that has a ton of interest and we already have very, very large deployments of those. So that's an area that is very exciting. As far as machine learning goes, what we are doing is we're really enabling our sales architecturally to really accommodate machine learning services so that we can really take advantage of all the technology that is out there. What you're not going to see from Snowflake is that we're going to go buy something and then go it alone and sort of shut out our partners. Our architecture and our strategy is very much on embracing and enabling all the capabilities that are out there. Customers have tons and tons of choice, they can - they can use ready-made services, they can use the tooling for building new services and that is in contrast to some of the competitors that we have in the marketplace. So we have very specifically chosen for that path, but we're going to be super-super active in data science is why because they're the ultimate consumer of the Snowflake cloud data platform. Yes. So I - we talked about this quite a bit during the road show, when we joined the company Snowflake was mostly a sort of a commercial selling, high density relatively small contracts, but high volume and fast sales cycles, quick adoption and the company really like that model. But as coming in we just know that in order to win in markets, you have to knock down the biggest and most iconic logos and whatever city, country or region that you're in. So we really have to pivot our organization or I should say enhance the organization to layer in selling strategy and a sales motion that campaigns these very large institutions. And we went as far and we were a private company at the time of course you know we did open heart surgery on our sales organization and we separated between sales organization that campaigns the largest 250 accounts in the world and then sort of the rest of the large enterprises and then we're segment of even more on the low end also. And that's because the type of sales people that we have to hire, the type of legal contractual posture that we have, the security team that we have, the type of compensation plan that we need have, all different when you're comparing large accounts because there are long campaigns, very political, they're very challenging, requires tons of senior management involvement. So we've been working on is now for well over a year. And you know as Mike pointed out in his prepared remarks and we made a ton of progress. And we expect to become very heavily weighted over time to sort of that part of our business, because these large accounts. I mean the amount of money that they were spending just to sort of this is going to be much larger than anybody is currently really understanding, because this is becoming so important, so core to how they do things. So, yes, it's a very important shift or evolution whatever words you want to use, so that we are very aggressively oriented towards the largest companies and institutions in the world. Tyle, it's Frank. The important thing to understand is that gaining and providing data access to external sources or whether they are inside an institution or whether they're external is becoming a main part of data operations. Historically, it hasn't been, I mean, we never used file transfer protocols, APIs to move data from ADB, it was logistically incredibly hard, it was very governance challenges. People did it because they had to, but they absolutely didn't like it. So here comes Snowflake with a frictionless seamless data sharing model in all of the sudden is like, hey part of our data operations is that we both gained and provide access to in the case of large financial institutions, there are hundreds and hundreds of data sets that they - that they gain access to and provide access to. So data sharing is part of data operations, where we're just for the first time now really providing an extremely strong model - operational model to be able to do that and I know historically people just didn't do as much of this because it was so damn hard. Now I will tell you that job one for most of our customers is, well, first, I got to get my data to the cloud, then I got do to database migrations, which is - which is really the biggest part of the transition. This is just modernization and then you know we start thinking about transformations in terms of running processes that we've never run before, things that are now possible that couldn't be done before. And typically, data sharing is sort of the Frontier if you will of the new things that are now possible that people had never even considered before. I mean it was not even an option and they were so preoccupied with just doing things in terms of blocking and tackling, but they had never gotten around to really fully examining and understanding and what is now possible. So it's usually - data sharing is usually not the first part of the conversation. It's something that's sort of evolves over time and what we are seeing though is that where we're now getting into deals - deals where people already have strong incumbents on the cloud relative to existing workloads. And the Data Cloud and our data sharing capabilities are busting open accounts, as you are aware normally on a workload basis, we would not really have that much opportunity or to customer incentive to even look at it. So the Salesforce loves that about this conversation, where we're hitting 1,000. Okay, that never fails to trigger new interest. So we like it for all of those reasons. Well, we're going to do both. What I did say was, like we don't want to sort of want to go to the marketplace and say we're going to have to use our and that said, there are enough people that operate in that mode. So we're going to have a much richer, wider, broader set of choices for customers. Certainly, what - my comments about Snow Park, I mean, considering that we're going to have Java, Python language run times in our platform, that's going to be a key enabler for people to develop these kind of capabilities and used to kind of capabilities that they're already using today. So it really bring those workloads that already - that already exist or that are being newly developed to bring that inside the Snowflake platform. So we're not going to be a company where we have our own flavor of everything and our partners are all going to be secondary. We want to actively encourage development on our platform, participation on our platform, because again we're consumption company. So the way we drive our strategy is to drive activity on our platform, right. I mean, if we get activity in our platform, whether our product drives it or/and other product drives it, it yields the same result, right. So we'd be crazy to - because the way our model works, we don't have to prioritize our own product. Well, the data engineering side of our business is already a huge part of our drive to consumption on our platform. And everything that we're doing with Snow Park is obviously focused on that as well because so much of that work is going to be data transformation oriented. So, no, it's a huge thing. But we're going to do things that are - that are Snowflake optimized, right, and sort of processes that run all the way from - from ingestion and transformation and bringing data on the platform, running analytical process to make that as seamless and as frictionless as possible, and our partners in the ecosystem, they serve many mastered, we only serve one that Snowflake. Well, it's obviously is not a no-brainer. Otherwise, we probably would have done it a long time ago. But we - our technical teams are now heavily invested in making this happen. I mean our announcement was - was very much the very first time, we've talked about this openly. I expect that in our next Snowflake summer event, which is in June of next year, we will have extensive technical details and presentations on this topic. So we'll be communicating on this topic in full detail at that time. We're certainly not prepared ready to do it right now. Yes, I think - I think longer term, I mean, I think everybody is going to be doing. As I said earlier, this is going to become core to data operations. This has held the whole notion of a Data Cloud is, you're not just running Data Sciences against your own data silos, you're going to be running it across disparate data sets, meaning data that lives inside of your world, outside of your world, that's really what data science is all about is to - is to build these highly descriptive models that can then we used predictably and prescriptively to really get closer to business outcomes. So in order for the Data Cloud to really happen as a concept, this is going to become incredibly mainstream. That is our general strategic assumption about data. It is not going to stay where it has been historically, because we were essentially encumbered by technology and we're not anymore, it's wide open. So I think customers are learning and slowly sort of gaining an appreciation what all the new possibilities are. I mean, I said in my prepared remarks, technology is not well ahead of people's ability to use it, right. When people are scratching their heads like, wow, this is this is just unbelievable the scale, the scope, the power that we have. How do we use it? And that's sort of where we are. Really exciting, but nobody sort of have the playbook ready to throw at it. So it's a bit of a journey that - that we're on, everybody will be on. Yes, we had a really good quarter in Europe. We're very excited about that. Europe was definitely a region where we have to sort of re-rack ourselves in terms of our large account orientation. I mean Europe is even more sensitive to a major account campaigning because that's sort of how these markets operate. They really look through their own iconic enterprises to see what kind of decisions they're making and the whole market kind of follow. So you simply cannot afford to be in those markets and not campaign as large enterprises. So a fairly substantial sort of I reboot for us to be able to have that posture, but where we're seeing it pay off, and I have very high expectations and how up for Europe and we're going to be spending time there when we can travel again to help campaign those institutions. It's a very, very good opportunity. As far as the Fed goes, the hard part about federal government is always getting them on the cloud. They have historically been incredibly slow to move to the cloud for all kinds of reasons. So the FedRAMP certifications, that we have - we have achieved some certification that are helping. We need higher level of certifications to really enable that business further. And that is really sort of the gating factor, if you will, for the Fed really becoming a solid contributor to the business, which they're not yet. So here's the important thing, I already mentioned it a little bit earlier. So it's not like it's a variable period, right. In other words, this is not fixed. People can't consume as much and as low as they have appetite and budget for, which is why you have this buoyancy in net revenue retention rate because people - because they now can. They start doing things that they could not do before. The big thing and by the way it's not CIOs that are - that are upset, it's usually CFOs that are... How you go from one period to the next and the number has doubled, but the business is telling them no, we need to do this. So people are getting used to spending way more money on this class of service than they ever imagined, and the reason is, they now can and they now need to right. Now, does that take time. Yes, it takes time for people to get used to that. I mean I've talked to CTOs, they've said we spent $50,000 last year, we're spending $1 million this year. How do I explain that. Well, you know, that is - those are the types of transitions that we're going through. We have customers where we are the second largest line item behind Amazon, AWS, right. Well, that's we're getting used to for customer that you're spending on a service like this at this rate, but when data becomes the beating heart of your enterprise, it makes total sense. It's just, it doesn't make sense in a historical context and it takes time for us to transition to this realization that like this is pretty damned important and that's sort of where it sometimes it goes a little bit too quick. People are like holy-moly this thing is a little bit too slick and too fast and it's just too easy to fire up a cluster of warehouse and still are running this process once a week. We're now running at every night, because they see advantage in doing it, right. But we're seeing people getting used to large numbers, I mean I'm quite honestly in my own history and software, I'm just stunned by the size of the relationships that we're seeing in this business and it's - it's an amazing thing, but it does take time for people to really transitioned to the realization that this is going to have a big economic footprint. Yes, I don't know that we need to trade those off quite honestly. We can walk and chew gum, if you will. So we're operating on both those vectors at the same time. In terms of data providers, it's sometimes more of a qualitative than a quantitative thing because they're not all created equal. So some of those and by the way it's very vertically oriented in the types of data that we're dealing with. So it's a fairly nuance thing. It's very important for us that we enrich the Data Cloud with new data out all the time because there are going to be more and more customers who - the reason to be on Snowflake is not just a world-class execution capabilities that we have, but they need to be there because their partners, their data providers are there, that after a while starts to break the bow, because it becomes a no-brainer. But we have to have both, if you don't have that workload execution capabilities, the data richness will not save you, you need to have both. Yes, the only thing I'll add to that is that is - we're also on a massive push to drive verticalization and in our selling motions. And that means that quota is going to be overlaid and added by vertical as well. So you will see our capacity to sell will grow and it's really nice that we have - we have a geographically, we have it by large enterprise accounts and we're going to have it by vertical. So we're very excited about the company verticalizing, because we're having great business in the technology side, in the media side, retail consumer buckets, goods health care. So that's where lot of our selling capacity is going to grow in the coming years."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 Fiscal Year 2022 Snowflake Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s call over to Mr. Jimmy Sexton, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nJimmy Sexton: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Snowflake\u2019s Q4 fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. With me in Bozeman, Montana are Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer; and Christian Kleinerman, our Senior Vice President of Product, will join us for the Q&A session. During today\u2019s call, we will review our financial results for fourth quarter fiscal 2022 and discuss our guidance for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, products and features, long-term growth and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, that we will file with the SEC. We caution you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations. We\u2019d also like to point out that on today\u2019s call, we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. To see reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings press release distributed earlier today and our investor presentation, which are posted at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks, Jimmy. Good afternoon, everybody. We finished fiscal 2022 with a record-breaking consumption and bookings results. Product revenue surpassed $1.1 billion for the full year, growing 106% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations were $2.6 billion, representing year-on-year growth of 99%. Q4 was our strongest bookings quarter-to-date and included a number of large multiyear commitments. Our net revenue retention rate reached 178%, driven by continued growth from our largest customers. In the quarter, we added 14 Fortune 500 and 21 Global 2000 customers. Key enterprise wins included the California Department of Public Health and KPMG, who is also a new alliance partner. We closed the year with $150 million non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow pealing high growing with improving unit economics and operational efficiency. Snowflake\u2019s growth is driven by digital transformation and long-term secular trends in data science and analytics enabled by cloud-scale computing and Snowflake\u2019s cloud-native architecture. Snowflake is a single data operations platform that addresses a broad spectrum of workload types and incredible performance economy and governance. As a platform, Snowflake enables the data cloud, a world without silos and the promise of unfettered data science. In the most recent Dresner Advisory Survey, 100% of Snowflake customers surveyed said they would recommend Snowflake to other organizations for the fifth year in a row. Our focus is to continually enable more workload types, use cases and data types. This fully aligns with our consumption model, which drives work to the data and still have data the work. During the fourth quarter, we announced several product development milestones, including: Snowpark, our developer framework that helps data scientists and developers transform and program data. Snowpark for Python is now in private preview, and Snowpark for Java on AWS is now generally available. ITAR, we now support compliance with the international traffic and arms regulations in our Microsoft Azure government and AWS GovCloud regions. Generally available data governance capabilities, including object tagging and conditional data masking; object tagging, in particular, is important for cataloging of data and resource consumption governance; and continued advancement with higher concurrency and lower latency workloads. Snowflake data sharing is seeing continued traction in the field. In fiscal 2022, the number of stable edges grew 130% year-on-year. 18% of our growing customer base has at least one stable edge that is up from 13% a year ago. Snowflake\u2019s Data Marketplace listings grew 195% this year, now with more than 1,100 data listings from over 230 providers. Our Snowflake Data Marketplace fuels our rich application development ecosystem and powered by snowflake program. To date, there are over 285 Powered by Snowflake partners, including new members Yext and Habu. We continue to elevate our go-to-market functions with an industry-specific focus. In the fourth quarter, we hosted our first Media Data Cloud Summit. The event highlighted real-world customer use cases. Companies like Experian, Roku and Warner Music Group showed how they are leveraging the media data cloud to protect consumer data and drive advertising subscriber growth. Our priority for the year is essentially unchanged and is as follows: first, the enablement and expansion of our workload types. Nothing is more core to our mission to develop the data cloud. The existing workload types, such as data lake, data engineering and data science develop continuously to become more functional, efficient and performance. New workload types will be announced later this year. Our focus on Snowpark and enabling workloads driven by languages such as Java and Python fall under this header. Today, we announced our intent to acquire Streamlit to accelerate data applications development on Snowflake. Streamlit enables data scientists to build, deploy and share data applications. Data scientists will be able government data to build applications powered by Snowflake. 1.5 million applications have already been built on Streamlit, and we will continue to invest in the open source framework that developers love. We\u2019ve agreed to pay $800 million with a mix of cash and stock. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Secondly, we\u2019re expanding our use cases by vertical industry as well as functions such as IT, sales, marketing, finance and engineering. We are continuing to drive collaboration through data sharing with leading enterprise software companies to drive this trend. Third, as of February 1, we have also verticalized part of our selling motion to address our largest customers by industry. Lastly, we\u2019ll continue to deepen and broaden our geographical scope, expecting faster growing contributions coming from outside the United States. We\u2019re excited about starting a new Snowflake fiscal year. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. Q4 was another quarter of exceptional execution and strong finish to our fiscal year. Q4 product revenues were $360 million, representing 102% year-over-year growth. Remaining performance obligations accelerated to 99% year-over-year, reaching $2.6 billion. Of the $2.6 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 52% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, representing 85% year-over-year growth. For Q4 product revenue, we anticipated holiday season headwinds. However, we did see a slower-than-expected return to normal consumption in January. We also introduced platform enhancements that improved efficiency higher than expected, which lowered credit consumption. Our increased net revenue retention rate of 178% includes 15 new $1 million customers and reflects durable growth among our largest customers. Similar to last quarter, six of our top ten customers\u2019 product revenue grew faster than the company overall. Our industry vertical investments are yielding strong results. Q4 was our largest bookings quarter to date, and the outperformance spanned across all our core verticals: financial services, retail and CP&G, advertising and media, health care and technology accounted for 85% of net new bookings in Q4. Large deal volume continues to increase in these verticals. In the quarter, we closed seven deals at or above $30 million in total contract value, up from just one in Q4 of last year. Significant contractual commitments give us confidence that our largest customers\u2019 consumption will continue to grow. In Q4, we saw a number of customers with greater than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue increased to 184 up from 148 last quarter. Turning to margins. On a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 74.99%, up nearly 500 basis points from last year. Enterprise success and growing scale across regions contribute to steady gross margin improvement. Operating margin was 5%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and hiring linearity. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 27%, positively impacted by strong collections and operating margin outperformance. We do experience free cash flow seasonality, and Q1 and Q4 will continue to be our strongest free cash flow quarters. Given the record bookings in Q4, you should expect to see outsized adjusted free cash in Q1 of this year. We are proud of our free cash flow progress, and we will continue to invest for growth with a focus on efficiency. We are committed to showing leverage year-on-year. We ended the year in a strong cash position, with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Going forward, we are using our strong cash position to transition to a net share settlement for vesting of employee RSUs in almost all countries. This will help us further manage dilution, which has already been running below 1% year-on-year on a fully diluted basis. Now let\u2019s turn to guidance, which includes the full impact of the Streamlit acquisition. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect product revenues between $385 million and $388 million, representing year-over-year growth between 79% and 81%. Turning to margins. We expect on a non-GAAP basis, negative 2% operating margin, and we expect 359 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal 2023, we expect product revenue between $1.88 billion and $1.9 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 65% and 67%. As we have mentioned before, certain product improvements create a revenue headwind for our business. We undertake these initiatives because they benefit our customers and expand our long-term market opportunity. Last year, we called it improvements in storage compression that reduced storage costs for our customers. Similarly, phased throughout this year, we are rolling out platform improvements within our cloud deployments. No two customers are the same, but our initial testing has shown performance improvements ranging on average from 10% to 20%. We have assumed an approximately $97 million revenue impact in our full year forecast, but there is still uncertainty around the full impact these improvements can have. While these efforts negatively impact our revenue in the near term, over time, they lead customers to deploy more workloads to Snowflake due to the improved economics. Turning to profitability for the full year fiscal 2023, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, 74.5% product gross margin, 1% operating margin and 15% adjusted free cash flow margin. And we expect 360 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Our gross margin guidance includes performance improvements and investments in additional deployments around the world, most notably, government deployments and international. In order to support our continued growth initiatives, we plan on adding more than 1,500 net new employees during the year. And lastly, we will host our in-person Investor Day the week of June 13 in Las Vegas in conjunction with Snowflake Summit, our annual users conference. If you are interested in attending, please e-mail ir@snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Cuestas with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thanks. It\u2019s actually Brad Zelnick for Deutsche Bank. Congrats on an amazing quarter and a strong finish to the year. Mike, I wanted to drill down a little bit more into the platform enhancements that you talked about that resulted in optimization and consumption efficiency in the quarter. And you mentioned, I think it had a 10% to 20% impact, and you called out the $97 million that I think you baked in that\u2019s going forward. To what extent does that compare to the expectations that maybe you had in your forecast? But more importantly, how should we think about the slope of the curve and cadence of future improvements that clearly benefit the customer but the impact that then has on the model? I guess maybe the confidence that you have in calling out $97 million. Thanks.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. Good question. So first of all, as an example, for Q4, there was a rollout of what we call our warehouse scheduling service. We only rolled that out in for three weeks and we saw a $2 million improvement \u2013 impact, an improvement for our customers using less but doing the same number of queries because they\u2019re not \u2013 it\u2019s much more efficient when you\u2019re scheduling queries to run them and rolling that out for next year. That is much bigger than what we were anticipating, and the full year impact of that next year is quite significant. But what we generally see is when we do these things, there\u2019s usually a lag of about six months when we start to see more workloads move to Snowflake. And then there\u2019s other platform improvements that we\u2019re doing that we rolled out in beta in the end of the quarter, and it\u2019s starting to be rolled out now throughout the year. And the gross is actually more like $160 million, but I do expect that will be offset by over $60 million in additional workloads coming from our customers. And in terms of what we\u2019re expecting, we knew these were going to come next year, and we never gave any guidance for next year yet. So it\u2019s within what we were guiding. I just want to remind people of these.\nBrad Zelnick: Very helpful context, Mike. And I mean, the growth that you\u2019re delivering at scale, I think, is unprecedented. Maybe a real quick follow-up for Frank. As we contemplate the results and the guide for next year, is the Streamlit acquisition, which congratulations on it, by the way. Any response to competitive changes in the market or is this something that has been teed up in part of the vision for a while? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: Hey Brad, it\u2019s Frank. No, this is definitely part of a strategy focus that we\u2019ve been talking about and making announcements on for the better part of last year, and that\u2019s the focus of driving workloads really from the developer to Snowflake. We\u2019ve been obviously super successful to drive it from the data engineering, data warehousing, data analytics side. But with the initiatives around Snowpark, all the programmability options for us to really address the Python developer community, this is going to be a superb asset for Snowflake. So we have to address workloads across the spectrum, and this is going to help us do that in places where we historically have not been as well represented as we\u2019ve been in other areas. Yes.\nBrad Zelnick: It\u2019s a great asset. Congrats on the deal. Thanks for taking my questions, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much. And I\u2019ll add my congrats on just a very strong bookings quarter that you\u2019re reporting here, especially on the RPO line. I wanted to ask about the comment on the slower-than-normal return to consumption growth in January. Plenty of other software companies saw slower consumption over the holidays. I\u2019m curious, did you get any sense of what occurred in January that might have driven that behavior perhaps relating to Omicron or other factors? And have you seen that change in any direction so far in February?\nMike Scarpelli: So as I said, we did see kind of a little bit more of a holiday effect going into January, whether people were taking longer vacations, I don\u2019t know, but we did see it return to more normal in January. And you do see about 70% of our work is really driven by machines, the other 30% is humans and that machine and we can see that machine layer stays consistent on a daily basis and it\u2019s the human interaction that changes. And we did see a decrease in human interaction early in January, which leads us to believe people were taking vacations. As an example, last week, we look at it on a daily basis, was President\u2019s Week and ski week for a number of people. We see it decrease there as well, too. But then we see a return in a week like this.\nMark Murphy: Okay, understood. And just as a quick follow-up. I think recently, you\u2019ve had a favorable spread where retention, seems like it\u2019s giving you 70 points or more of revenue growth. But you\u2019ve had \u2013 the product revenue has been growing around 100%. Do you have any sense of how that relationship could end up playing out in fiscal year 2023, just given the dynamics with the platform improvements?\nFrank Slootman: I don\u2019t even try to compare net retention with revenue growth rates. But I will say, definitely, our net revenue retention will go down next year because of all these improvements. It will stay above 150, but it\u2019s not going to stay in the 170s.\nMark Murphy: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Frank, actually net your \u2013 as of February 1, you implemented changes with respect to verticalizing your sales motion. Can you elaborate on that? It sounds like you\u2019re seeing real progress with respect to verticalization. Just trying to get a sense of how substantial these changes may be as you kind of go after that opportunity.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. First of all, this is not a reorientation of our entire selling motion. It\u2019s really the upper stratum in terms of our large account focus. We really replaced the geographical backbone with an industry equivalent of that because we don\u2019t think, for a large account, the geographical breakdown really adds anything. We\u2019ve been talking on this call probably, I think, for the last four quarters about how we are really, in all aspects of our business, bringing a much stronger industry aperture to everything we\u2019re doing. Sales organization has been working all of last year on making this transition happen. So by time Feb 1 came around, everybody was fully up to speed, we\u2019re lock and loaded to let that go. But the broader context to industry orientation is that our selling motions and really our whole posture towards the industry is really shifting from a workload-oriented way of thinking to really to what are the use cases that the customer needs to address? I will tell you that in my almost three years here, initially. I mean, all the conversations were around architecture and moving workloads from on-premise to the cloud and how our database migrations are. And today, 9 out of 10 conversations are industry-specific, very, very industry-specific, oftentimes not necessarily with IT types with business people and data science types, people are really trying to drive predictive insights into the business, things that are becoming possible that never been done before. So the company really wants to evolve towards this posture in the marketplace. It doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to walk away from a workload transition that is bread and butter we\u2019re going to be doing that for forever literally because we\u2019re still in the very early stages of that transition as well. But we think the industry posture is all about us assuming the customer\u2019s point of view rather than our own, and we think that\u2019s correct way to do things.\nGregg Moskowitz: Super helpful. Thanks for that. And then just as a follow-up. So obviously, having Java available on Snowpark is great. We think eventually getting Python to be GA is going to become a big deal and Streamlit clearly enhances your exposure to Python. But what are your expectations of adoption of Snowpark over the next 12 months? How do you see this progressing?\nFrank Slootman: You want to take that, Christian?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes, sure. Hi, this is Christian. I don\u2019t know how to project as a percentage of the overall consumption. But if you just look at current adoption, Java is trending quite well. We see migrations from Spark from Hadoop and other workloads. And I can also share that for Python, right now, we have way more customers requesting access to the review that we can onboard currently. So they introduced super high, they generate a lot of consumption. Trends are very positive.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: In the guidance, is there a significant revenue contribution? And is there any significant sort of operating margin lag that we could be aware of?\nMike Scarpelli: Keith, your first part of your question was cut off. We couldn\u2019t hear it. Could you start from the beginning and rephrase that?\nKeith Weiss: Sorry. Yes, so I was just asking about the FY2023 guidance. You mentioned that Streamlit was in the guide but didn\u2019t give us much detail in terms of how it was in the guide. Is there a significant revenue contribution or operating margin impact that we should expect from the acquisition?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. There is about $25 million in expenses associated with Streamlit. There is no revenue. Streamlit has no de minimis, it\u2019s less than 100,000, and we won\u2019t be having a product ready on Streamlit until the end of the year so we\u2019re not factoring in any revenue that could come sooner.\nKeith Weiss: Got it, got it. And then when we think about the impacts from the platform improvements, obviously, you\u2019re calling out the revenue impact from the way that we look at the numbers and the net dollar expansion rate, I would assume that, that\u2019s also going to see a impact. Any way you can help us kind of understand what the impact on that is going to be on a go-forward basis?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. Well, I did say earlier on one of the questions, the net revenue retention is definitely going to come down. We\u2019re not going to guide to net revenue retention. It\u2019s hard to do. I\u2019ll just say it will be above 150, but it\u2019s definitely going to drop below 170.\nKeith Weiss: That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith \u2013 sorry, your next question comes from line of Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Your line is open.\nKamil Mielczarek: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong year. So you delivered very strong net expansion rates, impressively, I think accelerating up an already strong level this quarter. Can you provide some detail around some of the specific drivers? And how should we think about the relative contribution among the adoption of these workloads, more data is being load onto platforms for existing use cases and maybe expansion into newer departments within existing customers?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, you see the net expansion rate of 178% for the quarter. That is really driven by expansion, obviously, within existing customers, and it\u2019s a combination of new workloads or new divisions within companies. And it\u2019s across the board, new use cases as well, too, in there. I can\u2019t give really much more color than that.\nKamil Mielczarek: That\u2019s helpful. And just a follow-up on the customer count. So your net new customer growth, I think, was down slightly in the last two quarters. I realize that the long-term expectation is for Fortune 500 and other $1 million customers to generate the majority of your revenue, I think, 77% was the long-term target. How should we think about the pace of total customer growth going forward? Is it beginning to stabilize? And are we getting to a point where maybe you\u2019ve landed a large portion of the Fortune 500 and the focus begins to shift more from landing new customers and more towards expanding within existing.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. So to be honest, we don\u2019t focus on absolute number of customers. It\u2019s more on the quality of customers. And as we\u2019ve talked about before, Fortune 500 is not a great metric because it\u2019s too U.S.-centric, and we\u2019re actually focused more on Global 2000. Doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not focused on Fortune 500. And I will say Global 2000 excludes the public sector and the large private enterprises. So it\u2019s really going after quality large customers is what we\u2019re going after. And you will see fluctuation in the number of new customers we land in the quarter, but that fluctuation tends to be from small customers. And I just want to remind you, too, these sales cycles into these large customers, we don\u2019t find an opportunity in the quarter and close in the quarter for a new deal. These are one, two, sometimes three-year sales cycles to break into these large organizations, and those are the ones that become the $10 million-plus customers. And as I said, we now have 184 paying us north of $1 million a year, and we\u2019re very pleased with that growth up from 148. And we see, based upon the ones that are just on the cusp of $1 million that number will continue to increase.\nKamil Mielczarek: That\u2019s great. Thank you, and congrats again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDerrick Wood: Thanks. First question, Mike, just wanted to touch back on the seasonality and consumption. Can you just talk about how the consumption piece came in versus your expectations and maybe compare that with how new bookings and sales productivity came in versus expectations?\nMike Scarpelli: I would say the quarter actually came in pretty much where we were expecting, slightly off from consumption in January, but not a huge amount. I will say and I called it out, we were surprised at an enhancement we rolled out the profound impact of it. It was only out for a few weeks in January and had a $2 million impact. Other than that, we landed from a revenue standpoint where we were forecasting and guiding. We\u2019re \u2013 I was really surprised with the strength in bookings in the quarter. You saw that we closed over $1.2 billion in contract value in the quarter, growing our RPO to $2.6 billion. That was well above what we were planning internally. The other thing I want to call out, too, is we co-sold with the cloud vendors, $1.2 billion in contract value for the year as well.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Helpful color. And for Frank or Christian, wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the opportunity around security. I guess as you look into the New Year, I mean, how much demand are you seeing around customers wanted to build security data lakes or security analytics on your platform. And is there anything you guys may look to do to lean in more aggressively?\nFrank Slootman: Yes, we\u2019re going to make announcements on this topic later on this year. But that has been raised the priority and focus quite a lot for Snowflake. It\u2019s one of the best add-ons selling motions that we have in large account. We in Snowflake [ph] just an ideal platform for hosting that type of capability. So, you will see us lean into that opportunity a lot more going forward.\nDerrick Wood: Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of DJ Heinz with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nDJ Heinz: Hey guys. Frank, a two-part for you on the data sharing stuff. So the customers that have embraced data sharing, how long does it typically take for them to get there? Like can that happen quick or is it typically more with customers that have been on the platform for a bit? And then the follow-up, the part two would be, how much of an inflection consumption does that typically drive?\nFrank Slootman: Your first question, most of the time, not all the time, but most of the time, our customers have other priorities in terms of transitioning their databases and their workloads before they get on to data sharing if they weren\u2019t doing that before. But it\u2019s also quite possible that we have workloads that are driven by data sharing as a core premise. And obviously, then it\u2019s something that is a starting point, and that\u2019s something that sort of comes several iterations later. So it\u2019s all the. And so historically, our business has been very \u2013 must been a modernization play from existing workloads, and that\u2019s where you have to wait some time before people sort of get their CLX under them and they sort of move on to these opportunities. But that is starting to change as we said in our prepared remarks. We now have 18% of our customers having at least one stable edge as part of their platform, and that was up from 13% last year. So the data cloud is really happening, and that is what a rapidly growing customer base underneath it. Forgot what was the second part of your question?\nDJ Heinz: Just how much of an inflection that is in consumption?\nFrank Slootman: Well, it hasn\u2019t been an extraordinary inflection in consumption in terms of data sharing, driving consumption per se. But dairy sharing is a core underlying capability of an overload \u2013 of an overall workload footprint. So it\u2019s really important in that sense rather than sort of separating data sharing out as a specific workload driver.\nDJ Heinz: Yes, got it. And Mike, a very quick follow-up for you. Of the $800 million for Streamlit, how much is cash?\nMike Scarpelli: It\u2019s roughly 80-20, 80% stock, 20% cash.\nDJ Heinz: 80% stock. Okay, got it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly [indiscernible] with GIS. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hi this is Kash here, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I\u2019m curious to get your, Frank your best case scenario for Streamlit, the green vision, two or three years from now, what is Streamlit going to allow Snowflake to pursue in the machine learning data center that would consider for it to be a success? And Mike, a question for you. I know that you mentioned that you\u2019re passing along savings back to customers, but customers are also coming back and doing more workloads with you guys. So if you can just run to the rationale of why do you think renewal rate, net retention rates are going to go below 150 because it\u2019s coming off of a very verified based and you after all earned the goodwill and trust of your customer. Thank you so much.\nMike Scarpelli: I\u2019ll answer first, and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Christian, who is very passionate about Streamlit and what it can do for us. So in terms of your question on the enhancement we\u2019re doing, listen, we\u2019re running at 178% net revenue retention. These are extremely high numbers, of such big numbers to begin with, those percentages. And just the law of numbers as we have new customers that are coming into the pool that we\u2019ve \u2013 remember, that looks back two years ago, a customer has to be on for two years. That number will come down. And the efficiencies, we\u2019re talking 10% to 15%, 20% depends upon the customer based upon the platform, that has to come down, that number. And as I said, it will remain above 150 for quite some time, but I do think it\u2019s going to drop below 170 for the full year on average next year.\nChristian Kleinerman: Okay. And I\u2019ll comment \u2013 Christian here, comment on Streamlit. If you recall at Investor Day last June, we shared our vision to help organizations of all sizes build applications, data applications and data experiences on Snowflake. What we see with Streamlit is their super easy-to-use framework powering all sorts of applications, both for internal consumption of data within companies, but also coming to our marketplace and helping entire businesses. Some of them industry vertical business, some of them horizontal experiences. But at the end of the day, unlocking the power of data and creating new data experiences.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Thanks for taking the question. So Mike, your long-term free cash flow guide at Analyst Day was for 15% at $10 billion of product revenue and it looks like you\u2019re guiding to 15% free cash flow margin for FY 2023. So maybe just give us a sense for what\u2019s driving that big outperformance and how you\u2019re able to achieve that so much sooner? Is it mainly the efficiencies that you\u2019ve discovered over the last year? Just help us understand that.\nMike Scarpelli: A couple of things, we\u2019re entering into larger customer relationships, and you can see customers\u2019 consumption is picking up and which resulting in the renewing contracts early, which drives that free cash flow. I do fully expect, as I said on last call, that we will be revisiting our longer-term free cash flow and operating margin guidance. I do expect it will come up considerably, as I told you guys before, I\u2019m not going to [indiscernible] number now. And I want to remind people to don\u2019t be surprised when there\u2019s a really big free cash flow number in Q1 because of how big our bookings were. But over the year, that 15% is the full year, and there is seasonality with Q1 and Q4 being the highest of the four quarters.\nTyler Radke: Got it. And maybe just on the quarter as you recap this past year, how did kind of the number of replacement deals of a legacy on-prem data warehouse, how fast did that number grow? And just kind of what are you seeing in the pipeline as well on the legacy replacements? .\nMike Scarpelli: Well, most of our net new customers tend to be a replacement of some legacy, some can be cloud Gen 1 cloud products as well, too, but most of the large Global 2000 tend to be on-premise replacements. And you can see that in our G2K ads and our Fortune 500 ads. But there is a lot of growth as well within existing customers, and that continues to be very strong for us as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thank you. Quick \u2013 two quick questions, if I may squeeze it in. Mike, if you look at other vendors, if they have product improvements that actually saves their customer cost they usually have like a sharing model of like the customer gain something and you gained something through maybe like price increases, et cetera. Is that something that over time could happen? Or are you really happy to continue to benefits back to customers? And then for Frank, just briefly, any update on the unstructured data opportunity? Because I remember that was a big focus for this year. Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. So our whole philosophy is as any improvement we do will benefit the customer, but it benefits us long term, too, because anything we do allows them to do more with the credits they bought, the price they pay \u2013 a certain price per credit. They can run more queries per credit they buy. And what happens is, when customers see their performance per credit, and it\u2019s trending, that is getting cheaper for them to run things. They realize they can do other things cheaper in Snowflake and they move more data into us to run more queries. And so we have no intention on for existing customers increasing their pricing. What I will say is on new customers coming in, we will be very disciplined around discounting with new customers.\nFrank Slootman: On the topic, Raimo, on unstructured data, that actually the uptake has been quite strong on that. And we were expecting it and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s been happening. I mean, there\u2019s some really interesting new opportunities where data models are looking for relationships between unstructured data types and other types of data types, things that just weren\u2019t possible before that are now enabled by the platform. So we\u2019re driving this hard and we have tremendous expectations for unstructured data in general and the potential for data science, innovation and new data applications also in the context of the Streamlit acquisition. This is going to get very interesting for us.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you and good afternoon. Frank, I wanted to go back to the workload discussion. I think one of the things that stood out to us over the last quarter was just number of enterprises turning to Snowflake for supply chain, customer support, sales enablement, even machine learning workloads. I get data warehouse migrations will be the bread and butter business, but how big of an opportunity do you see in expanding the Snowflake footprint into these departmental areas? And how fast is that \u2013 are those workloads shifting to Snowflake? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: I think it\u2019s important for everybody on the call to understand that we are super early innings in terms of the total opportunity. And what is \u2013 what people are going to attempt to do with data, that\u2019s because the technology is running out front. These many things that have never been done before. And it\u2019s not like throwing a switch all of a sudden, everything is blinking green. We\u2019re in conversations almost every day now with customers that are trying to do predictive things with data that they\u2019ve never done before. And a lot of the challenges they have is with skill sets that translates from their core business. The data side and the gaps that exist there to make that all happening. So there\u2019s this very normal natural friction in the evolution of that, that we\u2019re trying to learn how to do these strengths. And you see that in the world of machine learning a lot. I mean, it gets talked about but it\u2019s actually incredibly hard to drive these benefits in a highly predictable manner. There\u2019s lots and lots of attempts at it, and people are not already on the first attempt, seeing exactly what they were hoping for. But the march is inexorable in the sense that this is where it\u2019s all going. I really think that a lot of the bread and butter that we do today, which is these 24-hour cycles, we\u2019re running a large, highly scaled analytical batch processes populating dashboards. When we come in, in the morning, we get to see yesterday\u2019s data. That\u2019s still fine and good. But that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re running these workflows really, really well now compared to what we were doing in the past, but what is coming in terms of the potential is enormous. And as I said, it is early days in terms of this entire opportunity.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color there. And then just, Mike, a follow-up on platform enhancements. As you think about the impact to the guide, how much of it is mostly the warehouse scheduling feature versus other, let\u2019s say, lower CPU pricing resources you\u2019re passing on to clients? Just trying to think through what you\u2019ve baked in. And is it mostly just scheduling or other things as well?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. What I\u2019d say from the gross impact, roughly 40% is coming from warehouse scheduling on a net basis, about 30%, and then the balance is coming from other software improvements and hardware improvements that we see happening.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. Frank, I was wondering if you can just talk about the GSIs and the progress you\u2019re seeing there. I think Accenture had a milestone trained post pretty recently. Just what can they do for you from this sort of a demand gen perspective in fiscal 2023? And then just, Mike, on the platform improvements, can you just kind of conceptualize to us you think about that from a return perspective? Obviously, it\u2019s a $100 million headwind. This year, I think you mentioned you start to see a pickup of six months later. How should we kind of think about sort of \u2013 or at least how you think about it conceptually from the kind of benefit you get from delivering those improvement factor to your customers? Thanks.\nMike Scarpelli: So the way we look at it, the benefit is, first of all, the customers see an immediate price performance improvement. And our customers are always looking at price performance. And when they compare our price performance versus running it whether in another cloud or running it on-prem in their existing data warehouses, they make the move to move more things into. As a reminder, we have landed hundreds of customers to do these big on-prem Teradata migration. I think we\u2019ve only completed \u2013 we\u2019re completely shut down a little over 30 of those is maybe in the mid-30s now. There\u2019s piles of other workloads that they plan on moving and when customers see the price performance, they will accelerate the movement of those other workloads to us and we have historically seen that. As I said, I do anticipate that we will see some. As a reminder, we see the gross impact of about $162 million for the year, and we think we will make up about $65.5 million in revenue. And a lot of that does \u2013 there is a lag and that depends on the customer. It could be a one-month lag. It could be a six-month lag before they realize that and move more workloads. But based upon what we\u2019re seeing, we think there will be about $65 million coming back in to get to that net $96.7 million, if you want to be precise what we\u2019re estimating.\nFrank Slootman: On your question about SIs, I know, you mentioned Accenture in particular; we\u2019re expecting a much higher contribution and partnership with Accenture going forward. We\u2019ve had outstanding relationships, obviously with many others, notably Deloitte. We also announced a relationship with KPMG. It\u2019s just the intersection with the large SIs and these large Global 2000 accounts is inevitable. So you will see more and more of that business intersecting with Snowflake and those relationships becoming very, very large over time. Things that we\u2019ve seen before in other companies is absolutely going to happen for Snowflake as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is open.\nKarl Keirstead: Well thanks. Two questions. So Mike to start, does the Q1 April product revenue guide of $388 million assume a more conservative view on usage ramps, given what you flagged in early January? Or does it assume basically a return to normal activity seasonality?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, it includes about $10 million revenue hit because of these product enhancements that we see. And it\u2019s based upon what we\u2019re seeing today in terms of how customers are returning after vacations.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. And then as a second question, if I could just press a little bit on the context to passing on these platform improvements. Companies normally don\u2019t willingly make changes that cut 5% out of the revenues. So I\u2019m curious, were you getting pushback from customers around price performance relative to alternative products and you decided to try to alleviate that price pushback by making this change? Like what\u2019s the broader context for doing this because it\u2019s very rare?\nMike Scarpelli: I\u2019m going to let Christian talk from a product standpoint why he and others feel this is very, and including me, feel this is the right thing to do for our customers and pays off in the long-term.\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. So, hi, Karl we\u2019ve been doing this since the very beginning of Snowflake. We\u2019ve always been focused on improving the performance of the system, and we are very cognizant that it improves the economics for our customers. And the rationale behind it is that there\u2019s so much more data being created every day. And the more the marginal cost and effort of getting value out of the data decreases, we know that there\u2019s a lot more value for company to generate out of the data. We see it time and time again. The more improving the economics of the platform, the more use cases come to Snowflake. So we\u2019re looking at this with a very long-term view.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. Let me say one thing, it\u2019s Frank. This is not philanthropy. We are very much doing this \u2013 that this stimulates demand. And by the way, we can\u2019t prove that to ourselves by going back years because we\u2019ve done this over-and-over and it does stimulate demand but it doesn\u2019t do it in real time, there\u2019s a lag involved in this process.\nMike Scarpelli: I will add. I think this is probably the biggest magnitude impact at one time in any platform improvement that we\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve been here.\nFrank Slootman: First, the scale of the business.\nMike Scarpelli: And vision here, that\u2019s true. In prior years, we did similar everything.\nFrank Slootman: Early on in the company, yes.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay, thank you all of you. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Mike, I think earlier in the call, you had mentioned about 30% of the workloads are machine to machine. Can you give us a sense of where that\u2019s been historically and where you think that can go to over time?\nMike Scarpelli: As what I said was about 70% of the queries in the work are machine scheduled. They\u2019re not \u2013 you don\u2019t need a human to go on a schedule, and these are automated processes that happen because you want to refresh queries every so often and about 30% is human-driven. And that\u2019s been pretty consistent for quite some time. Haven\u2019t seen any change there.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. We also think we\u2019re projecting workloads also under the influence of Python becoming available and more developer-centric workload coming our way, but which tends to be more interactive, you balance that out with machine learning models that we believe are going to be more scheduled in terms of generating predictive results and so on. So we think that breakdown might well hold over a period of time where we obviously we keep looking at that.\nBrad Reback: Got it. Sorry for getting that transposed. And one other thing I hope I\u2019m not trying to transposing as well. I think you also said that there was $1.2 billion co-sold with the hyperscalers for the year. I think last quarter, you talked about $500 million, which would obviously imply you added $700 million \u2013 that seems like a really big number.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. It was very \u2013 and we sold in totaled for the quarter over $1.2 billion just for the quarter and roughly $700 million was co-sold with the hyperscalers. And I will say the vast majority of that is AWS. I would say zero was GCP and the balance was Azure.\nBrad Reback: Perfect. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nAri Terjanian: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the close of the year. I just wanted to double click on international. Could you provide more color if the consumption trends you saw in terms of the holiday seasonality was consistent across geos? And then just more color on your plans for FY 2023 and the geographic expansion this year. Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: So I didn\u2019t really notice anything by geo in terms of differences. And I will admit, I didn\u2019t really dig into that, but I can\u2019t think of anything or I would have heard something from someone. In terms of \u2013 we continue to focus on international expansion. We think Europe is set to have a very good year this year. APJ, we\u2019ve been investing a lot there. I mentioned we are opening new deployments. We\u2019re getting a request to open deployments. A new one in India, for instance, there\u2019s one in Brazil that we\u2019ll be opening this year. We\u2019re looking at another one in Asia as well in Europe, there\u2019s another one or two that we\u2019ll be opening. So the reason we\u2019re opening these is we\u2019re seeing the opportunity. So I do expect international, over time, will become a bigger portion of our revenue. It\u2019s just that our growth within the U.S. continues to be phenomenal, especially in our enterprise segment.\nAri Terjanian: Right, right. And then just one follow-up, if I may. Can you remind us, could you just fill out what were the impact of platform enhancements, both gross and net to FY 2022 product revenues?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I just said about $2 million was Q4 for one of the enhancements we rolled out in January for about three weeks. That wasn\u2019t even to all of our customers. It\u2019s now rolled out fully. The other one we talked about at our Investor Day was the storage compression, which we did see a reduction in storage, bringing that down to about 10 but it ends up compute becomes a higher percent, and that helps our margins.\nAri Terjanian: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions. Thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes, sure. Hi, this is Christian. I don't know how to project as a percentage of the overall consumption. But if you just look at current adoption, Java is trending quite well. We see migrations from Spark from Hadoop and other workloads. And I can also share that for Python, right now, we have way more customers requesting access to the review that we can onboard currently. So they introduced super high, they generate a lot of consumption. Trends are very positive. Okay. And I'll comment \u2013 Christian here, comment on Streamlit. If you recall at Investor Day last June, we shared our vision to help organizations of all sizes build applications, data applications and data experiences on Snowflake.

            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks, Jimmy. Good afternoon, everybody. We finished fiscal 2022 with a record-breaking consumption and bookings results. Product revenue surpassed $1.1 billion for the full year, growing 106% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations were $2.6 billion, representing year-on-year growth of 99%. Q4 was our strongest bookings quarter-to-date and included a number of large multiyear commitments. Our net revenue retention rate reached 178%, driven by continued growth from our largest customers. In the quarter, we added 14 Fortune 500 and 21 Global 2000 customers. Key enterprise wins included the California Department of Public Health and KPMG, who is also a new alliance partner. We closed the year with $150 million non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow pealing high growing with improving unit economics and operational efficiency. Snowflake's growth is driven by digital transformation and long-term secular trends in data science and analytics enabled by cloud-scale computing and Snowflake's cloud-native architecture. Snowflake is a single data operations platform that addresses a broad spectrum of workload types and incredible performance economy and governance. As a platform, Snowflake enables the data cloud, a world without silos and the promise of unfettered data science. In the most recent Dresner Advisory Survey, 100% of Snowflake customers surveyed said they would recommend Snowflake to other organizations for the fifth year in a row. Our focus is to continually enable more workload types, use cases and data types. This fully aligns with our consumption model, which drives work to the data and still have data the work. During the fourth quarter, we announced several product development milestones, including: Snowpark, our developer framework that helps data scientists and developers transform and program data. Snowpark for Python is now in private preview, and Snowpark for Java on AWS is now generally available. ITAR, we now support compliance with the international traffic and arms regulations in our Microsoft Azure government and AWS GovCloud regions. Generally available data governance capabilities, including object tagging and conditional data masking; object tagging, in particular, is important for cataloging of data and resource consumption governance; and continued advancement with higher concurrency and lower latency workloads. Snowflake data sharing is seeing continued traction in the field. In fiscal 2022, the number of stable edges grew 130% year-on-year. 18% of our growing customer base has at least one stable edge that is up from 13% a year ago. Snowflake's Data Marketplace listings grew 195% this year, now with more than 1,100 data listings from over 230 providers. Our Snowflake Data Marketplace fuels our rich application development ecosystem and powered by snowflake program. To date, there are over 285 Powered by Snowflake partners, including new members Yext and Habu. We continue to elevate our go-to-market functions with an industry-specific focus. In the fourth quarter, we hosted our first Media Data Cloud Summit. The event highlighted real-world customer use cases. Companies like Experian, Roku and Warner Music Group showed how they are leveraging the media data cloud to protect consumer data and drive advertising subscriber growth. Our priority for the year is essentially unchanged and is as follows: first, the enablement and expansion of our workload types. Nothing is more core to our mission to develop the data cloud. The existing workload types, such as data lake, data engineering and data science develop continuously to become more functional, efficient and performance. New workload types will be announced later this year. Our focus on Snowpark and enabling workloads driven by languages such as Java and Python fall under this header. Today, we announced our intent to acquire Streamlit to accelerate data applications development on Snowflake. Streamlit enables data scientists to build, deploy and share data applications. Data scientists will be able government data to build applications powered by Snowflake. 1.5 million applications have already been built on Streamlit, and we will continue to invest in the open source framework that developers love. We've agreed to pay $800 million with a mix of cash and stock. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. Secondly, we're expanding our use cases by vertical industry as well as functions such as IT, sales, marketing, finance and engineering. We are continuing to drive collaboration through data sharing with leading enterprise software companies to drive this trend. Third, as of February 1, we have also verticalized part of our selling motion to address our largest customers by industry. Lastly, we'll continue to deepen and broaden our geographical scope, expecting faster growing contributions coming from outside the United States. We're excited about starting a new Snowflake fiscal year. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Hey Brad, it's Frank. No, this is definitely part of a strategy focus that we've been talking about and making announcements on for the better part of last year, and that's the focus of driving workloads really from the developer to Snowflake. We've been obviously super successful to drive it from the data engineering, data warehousing, data analytics side. But with the initiatives around Snowpark, all the programmability options for us to really address the Python developer community, this is going to be a superb asset for Snowflake. So we have to address workloads across the spectrum, and this is going to help us do that in places where we historically have not been as well represented as we've been in other areas. Yes. I don't even try to compare net retention with revenue growth rates. But I will say, definitely, our net revenue retention will go down next year because of all these improvements. It will stay above 150, but it's not going to stay in the 170s. Yes. First of all, this is not a reorientation of our entire selling motion. It's really the upper stratum in terms of our large account focus. We really replaced the geographical backbone with an industry equivalent of that because we don't think, for a large account, the geographical breakdown really adds anything. We've been talking on this call probably, I think, for the last four quarters about how we are really, in all aspects of our business, bringing a much stronger industry aperture to everything we're doing. Sales organization has been working all of last year on making this transition happen. So by time Feb 1 came around, everybody was fully up to speed, we're lock and loaded to let that go. But the broader context to industry orientation is that our selling motions and really our whole posture towards the industry is really shifting from a workload-oriented way of thinking to really to what are the use cases that the customer needs to address? I will tell you that in my almost three years here, initially. I mean, all the conversations were around architecture and moving workloads from on-premise to the cloud and how our database migrations are. And today, 9 out of 10 conversations are industry-specific, very, very industry-specific, oftentimes not necessarily with IT types with business people and data science types, people are really trying to drive predictive insights into the business, things that are becoming possible that never been done before. So the company really wants to evolve towards this posture in the marketplace. It doesn't mean that we're going to walk away from a workload transition that is bread and butter we're going to be doing that for forever literally because we're still in the very early stages of that transition as well. But we think the industry posture is all about us assuming the customer's point of view rather than our own, and we think that's correct way to do things. You want to take that, Christian? Yes, we're going to make announcements on this topic later on this year. But that has been raised the priority and focus quite a lot for Snowflake. It's one of the best add-ons selling motions that we have in large account. We in Snowflake [ph] just an ideal platform for hosting that type of capability. So, you will see us lean into that opportunity a lot more going forward. Your first question, most of the time, not all the time, but most of the time, our customers have other priorities in terms of transitioning their databases and their workloads before they get on to data sharing if they weren't doing that before. But it's also quite possible that we have workloads that are driven by data sharing as a core premise. And obviously, then it's something that is a starting point, and that's something that sort of comes several iterations later. So it's all the. And so historically, our business has been very \u2013 must been a modernization play from existing workloads, and that's where you have to wait some time before people sort of get their CLX under them and they sort of move on to these opportunities. But that is starting to change as we said in our prepared remarks. We now have 18% of our customers having at least one stable edge as part of their platform, and that was up from 13% last year. So the data cloud is really happening, and that is what a rapidly growing customer base underneath it. Forgot what was the second part of your question? Well, it hasn't been an extraordinary inflection in consumption in terms of data sharing, driving consumption per se. But dairy sharing is a core underlying capability of an overload \u2013 of an overall workload footprint. So it's really important in that sense rather than sort of separating data sharing out as a specific workload driver. On the topic, Raimo, on unstructured data, that actually the uptake has been quite strong on that. And we were expecting it and that's exactly what's been happening. I mean, there's some really interesting new opportunities where data models are looking for relationships between unstructured data types and other types of data types, things that just weren't possible before that are now enabled by the platform. So we're driving this hard and we have tremendous expectations for unstructured data in general and the potential for data science, innovation and new data applications also in the context of the Streamlit acquisition. This is going to get very interesting for us. I think it's important for everybody on the call to understand that we are super early innings in terms of the total opportunity. And what is \u2013 what people are going to attempt to do with data, that's because the technology is running out front. These many things that have never been done before. And it's not like throwing a switch all of a sudden, everything is blinking green. We're in conversations almost every day now with customers that are trying to do predictive things with data that they've never done before. And a lot of the challenges they have is with skill sets that translates from their core business. The data side and the gaps that exist there to make that all happening. So there's this very normal natural friction in the evolution of that, that we're trying to learn how to do these strengths. And you see that in the world of machine learning a lot. I mean, it gets talked about but it's actually incredibly hard to drive these benefits in a highly predictable manner. There's lots and lots of attempts at it, and people are not already on the first attempt, seeing exactly what they were hoping for. But the march is inexorable in the sense that this is where it's all going. I really think that a lot of the bread and butter that we do today, which is these 24-hour cycles, we're running a large, highly scaled analytical batch processes populating dashboards. When we come in, in the morning, we get to see yesterday's data. That's still fine and good. But that's \u2013 we're running these workflows really, really well now compared to what we were doing in the past, but what is coming in terms of the potential is enormous. And as I said, it is early days in terms of this entire opportunity. On your question about SIs, I know, you mentioned Accenture in particular; we're expecting a much higher contribution and partnership with Accenture going forward. We've had outstanding relationships, obviously with many others, notably Deloitte. We also announced a relationship with KPMG. It's just the intersection with the large SIs and these large Global 2000 accounts is inevitable. So you will see more and more of that business intersecting with Snowflake and those relationships becoming very, very large over time. Things that we've seen before in other companies is absolutely going to happen for Snowflake as well. Yes. Let me say one thing, it's Frank. This is not philanthropy. We are very much doing this \u2013 that this stimulates demand. And by the way, we can't prove that to ourselves by going back years because we've done this over-and-over and it does stimulate demand but it doesn't do it in real time, there's a lag involved in this process. First, the scale of the business. Early on in the company, yes. Yes. We also think we're projecting workloads also under the influence of Python becoming available and more developer-centric workload coming our way, but which tends to be more interactive, you balance that out with machine learning models that we believe are going to be more scheduled in terms of generating predictive results and so on. So we think that breakdown might well hold over a period of time where we obviously we keep looking at that."

            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Q4 was another quarter of exceptional execution and strong finish to our fiscal year. Q4 product revenues were $360 million, representing 102% year-over-year growth. Remaining performance obligations accelerated to 99% year-over-year, reaching $2.6 billion. Of the $2.6 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 52% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, representing 85% year-over-year growth. For Q4 product revenue, we anticipated holiday season headwinds. However, we did see a slower-than-expected return to normal consumption in January. We also introduced platform enhancements that improved efficiency higher than expected, which lowered credit consumption. Our increased net revenue retention rate of 178% includes 15 new $1 million customers and reflects durable growth among our largest customers. Similar to last quarter, six of our top ten customers' product revenue grew faster than the company overall. Our industry vertical investments are yielding strong results. Q4 was our largest bookings quarter to date, and the outperformance spanned across all our core verticals: financial services, retail and CP&G, advertising and media, health care and technology accounted for 85% of net new bookings in Q4. Large deal volume continues to increase in these verticals. In the quarter, we closed seven deals at or above $30 million in total contract value, up from just one in Q4 of last year. Significant contractual commitments give us confidence that our largest customers' consumption will continue to grow. In Q4, we saw a number of customers with greater than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue increased to 184 up from 148 last quarter. Turning to margins. On a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 74.99%, up nearly 500 basis points from last year. Enterprise success and growing scale across regions contribute to steady gross margin improvement. Operating margin was 5%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and hiring linearity. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 27%, positively impacted by strong collections and operating margin outperformance. We do experience free cash flow seasonality, and Q1 and Q4 will continue to be our strongest free cash flow quarters. Given the record bookings in Q4, you should expect to see outsized adjusted free cash in Q1 of this year. We are proud of our free cash flow progress, and we will continue to invest for growth with a focus on efficiency. We are committed to showing leverage year-on-year. We ended the year in a strong cash position, with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Going forward, we are using our strong cash position to transition to a net share settlement for vesting of employee RSUs in almost all countries. This will help us further manage dilution, which has already been running below 1% year-on-year on a fully diluted basis. Now let's turn to guidance, which includes the full impact of the Streamlit acquisition. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect product revenues between $385 million and $388 million, representing year-over-year growth between 79% and 81%. Turning to margins. We expect on a non-GAAP basis, negative 2% operating margin, and we expect 359 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal 2023, we expect product revenue between $1.88 billion and $1.9 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 65% and 67%. As we have mentioned before, certain product improvements create a revenue headwind for our business. We undertake these initiatives because they benefit our customers and expand our long-term market opportunity. Last year, we called it improvements in storage compression that reduced storage costs for our customers. Similarly, phased throughout this year, we are rolling out platform improvements within our cloud deployments. No two customers are the same, but our initial testing has shown performance improvements ranging on average from 10% to 20%. We have assumed an approximately $97 million revenue impact in our full year forecast, but there is still uncertainty around the full impact these improvements can have. While these efforts negatively impact our revenue in the near term, over time, they lead customers to deploy more workloads to Snowflake due to the improved economics. Turning to profitability for the full year fiscal 2023, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, 74.5% product gross margin, 1% operating margin and 15% adjusted free cash flow margin. And we expect 360 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Our gross margin guidance includes performance improvements and investments in additional deployments around the world, most notably, government deployments and international. In order to support our continued growth initiatives, we plan on adding more than 1,500 net new employees during the year. And lastly, we will host our in-person Investor Day the week of June 13 in Las Vegas in conjunction with Snowflake Summit, our annual users conference. If you are interested in attending, please e-mail ir@snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Yes. Good question. So first of all, as an example, for Q4, there was a rollout of what we call our warehouse scheduling service. We only rolled that out in for three weeks and we saw a $2 million improvement \u2013 impact, an improvement for our customers using less but doing the same number of queries because they're not \u2013 it's much more efficient when you're scheduling queries to run them and rolling that out for next year. That is much bigger than what we were anticipating, and the full year impact of that next year is quite significant. But what we generally see is when we do these things, there's usually a lag of about six months when we start to see more workloads move to Snowflake. And then there's other platform improvements that we're doing that we rolled out in beta in the end of the quarter, and it's starting to be rolled out now throughout the year. And the gross is actually more like $160 million, but I do expect that will be offset by over $60 million in additional workloads coming from our customers. And in terms of what we're expecting, we knew these were going to come next year, and we never gave any guidance for next year yet. So it's within what we were guiding. I just want to remind people of these. So as I said, we did see kind of a little bit more of a holiday effect going into January, whether people were taking longer vacations, I don't know, but we did see it return to more normal in January. And you do see about 70% of our work is really driven by machines, the other 30% is humans and that machine and we can see that machine layer stays consistent on a daily basis and it's the human interaction that changes. And we did see a decrease in human interaction early in January, which leads us to believe people were taking vacations. As an example, last week, we look at it on a daily basis, was President's Week and ski week for a number of people. We see it decrease there as well, too. But then we see a return in a week like this. Keith, your first part of your question was cut off. We couldn't hear it. Could you start from the beginning and rephrase that? Yes. There is about $25 million in expenses associated with Streamlit. There is no revenue. Streamlit has no de minimis, it's less than 100,000, and we won't be having a product ready on Streamlit until the end of the year so we're not factoring in any revenue that could come sooner. Yes. Well, I did say earlier on one of the questions, the net revenue retention is definitely going to come down. We're not going to guide to net revenue retention. It's hard to do. I'll just say it will be above 150, but it's definitely going to drop below 170. Well, you see the net expansion rate of 178% for the quarter. That is really driven by expansion, obviously, within existing customers, and it's a combination of new workloads or new divisions within companies. And it's across the board, new use cases as well, too, in there. I can't give really much more color than that. Yes. So to be honest, we don't focus on absolute number of customers. It's more on the quality of customers. And as we've talked about before, Fortune 500 is not a great metric because it's too U.S.-centric, and we're actually focused more on Global 2000. Doesn't mean we're not focused on Fortune 500. And I will say Global 2000 excludes the public sector and the large private enterprises. So it's really going after quality large customers is what we're going after. And you will see fluctuation in the number of new customers we land in the quarter, but that fluctuation tends to be from small customers. And I just want to remind you, too, these sales cycles into these large customers, we don't find an opportunity in the quarter and close in the quarter for a new deal. These are one, two, sometimes three-year sales cycles to break into these large organizations, and those are the ones that become the $10 million-plus customers. And as I said, we now have 184 paying us north of $1 million a year, and we're very pleased with that growth up from 148. And we see, based upon the ones that are just on the cusp of $1 million that number will continue to increase. I would say the quarter actually came in pretty much where we were expecting, slightly off from consumption in January, but not a huge amount. I will say and I called it out, we were surprised at an enhancement we rolled out the profound impact of it. It was only out for a few weeks in January and had a $2 million impact. Other than that, we landed from a revenue standpoint where we were forecasting and guiding. We're \u2013 I was really surprised with the strength in bookings in the quarter. You saw that we closed over $1.2 billion in contract value in the quarter, growing our RPO to $2.6 billion. That was well above what we were planning internally. The other thing I want to call out, too, is we co-sold with the cloud vendors, $1.2 billion in contract value for the year as well. It's roughly 80-20, 80% stock, 20% cash. I'll answer first, and then I'm going to turn it over to Christian, who is very passionate about Streamlit and what it can do for us. So in terms of your question on the enhancement we're doing, listen, we're running at 178% net revenue retention. These are extremely high numbers, of such big numbers to begin with, those percentages. And just the law of numbers as we have new customers that are coming into the pool that we've \u2013 remember, that looks back two years ago, a customer has to be on for two years. That number will come down. And the efficiencies, we're talking 10% to 15%, 20% depends upon the customer based upon the platform, that has to come down, that number. And as I said, it will remain above 150 for quite some time, but I do think it's going to drop below 170 for the full year on average next year. A couple of things, we're entering into larger customer relationships, and you can see customers' consumption is picking up and which resulting in the renewing contracts early, which drives that free cash flow. I do fully expect, as I said on last call, that we will be revisiting our longer-term free cash flow and operating margin guidance. I do expect it will come up considerably, as I told you guys before, I'm not going to [indiscernible] number now. And I want to remind people to don't be surprised when there's a really big free cash flow number in Q1 because of how big our bookings were. But over the year, that 15% is the full year, and there is seasonality with Q1 and Q4 being the highest of the four quarters. Well, most of our net new customers tend to be a replacement of some legacy, some can be cloud Gen 1 cloud products as well, too, but most of the large Global 2000 tend to be on-premise replacements. And you can see that in our G2K ads and our Fortune 500 ads. But there is a lot of growth as well within existing customers, and that continues to be very strong for us as well. Yes. So our whole philosophy is as any improvement we do will benefit the customer, but it benefits us long term, too, because anything we do allows them to do more with the credits they bought, the price they pay \u2013 a certain price per credit. They can run more queries per credit they buy. And what happens is, when customers see their performance per credit, and it's trending, that is getting cheaper for them to run things. They realize they can do other things cheaper in Snowflake and they move more data into us to run more queries. And so we have no intention on for existing customers increasing their pricing. What I will say is on new customers coming in, we will be very disciplined around discounting with new customers. Yes. What I'd say from the gross impact, roughly 40% is coming from warehouse scheduling on a net basis, about 30%, and then the balance is coming from other software improvements and hardware improvements that we see happening. So the way we look at it, the benefit is, first of all, the customers see an immediate price performance improvement. And our customers are always looking at price performance. And when they compare our price performance versus running it whether in another cloud or running it on-prem in their existing data warehouses, they make the move to move more things into. As a reminder, we have landed hundreds of customers to do these big on-prem Teradata migration. I think we've only completed \u2013 we're completely shut down a little over 30 of those is maybe in the mid-30s now. There's piles of other workloads that they plan on moving and when customers see the price performance, they will accelerate the movement of those other workloads to us and we have historically seen that. As I said, I do anticipate that we will see some. As a reminder, we see the gross impact of about $162 million for the year, and we think we will make up about $65.5 million in revenue. And a lot of that does \u2013 there is a lag and that depends on the customer. It could be a one-month lag. It could be a six-month lag before they realize that and move more workloads. But based upon what we're seeing, we think there will be about $65 million coming back in to get to that net $96.7 million, if you want to be precise what we're estimating. Well, it includes about $10 million revenue hit because of these product enhancements that we see. And it's based upon what we're seeing today in terms of how customers are returning after vacations. I'm going to let Christian talk from a product standpoint why he and others feel this is very, and including me, feel this is the right thing to do for our customers and pays off in the long-term. I will add. I think this is probably the biggest magnitude impact at one time in any platform improvement that we've done since I've been here. And vision here, that's true. In prior years, we did similar everything. As what I said was about 70% of the queries in the work are machine scheduled. They're not \u2013 you don't need a human to go on a schedule, and these are automated processes that happen because you want to refresh queries every so often and about 30% is human-driven. And that's been pretty consistent for quite some time. Haven't seen any change there. Yes. It was very \u2013 and we sold in totaled for the quarter over $1.2 billion just for the quarter and roughly $700 million was co-sold with the hyperscalers. And I will say the vast majority of that is AWS. I would say zero was GCP and the balance was Azure. So I didn't really notice anything by geo in terms of differences. And I will admit, I didn't really dig into that, but I can't think of anything or I would have heard something from someone. In terms of \u2013 we continue to focus on international expansion. We think Europe is set to have a very good year this year. APJ, we've been investing a lot there. I mentioned we are opening new deployments. We're getting a request to open deployments. A new one in India, for instance, there's one in Brazil that we'll be opening this year. We're looking at another one in Asia as well in Europe, there's another one or two that we'll be opening. So the reason we're opening these is we're seeing the opportunity. So I do expect international, over time, will become a bigger portion of our revenue. It's just that our growth within the U.S. continues to be phenomenal, especially in our enterprise segment. Well, I just said about $2 million was Q4 for one of the enhancements we rolled out in January for about three weeks. That wasn't even to all of our customers. It's now rolled out fully. The other one we talked about at our Investor Day was the storage compression, which we did see a reduction in storage, bringing that down to about 10 but it ends up compute becomes a higher percent, and that helps our margins."

We saw momentum accelerate in Q3 with product revenues growing 110% year-on-year to $312 million and remaining performance obligations growing to $1.8 billion. The net revenue retention rate expanded to 173% and we recorded our first positive non-GAAP operating income in the company's history. Our Q3 Fortune 500 customer count totaled 223, increasing by eight in the quarter and we now have 148 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million. Our growth is driven by a diverse mix of customers, the 10 largest consumers in Q3 include four Fortune 500 companies, four companies less than 10 years old, and a Powered By Snowflake program partner. We continued our international expansion with product revenue from EMEA and Asia-Pacific outstripping the company's year-on-year growth, up 174% and 219% respectively. We recently launched operations in three new countries Israel, Korea, and the United Arab Emirates. Vertical industry focus is an important evolution of our selling motion, especially in global enterprise accounts. During the quarter, we announced two industry data clouds. The Financial Services Data Cloud brings together to Snowflake platform partner solutions and industry data to help financial services organizations mobilize their data. Customers can launch products, build FinTech platforms, and accelerate their compliance on top of Snowflake. Industry leading customers Allianz, Blackrock, Capital One, New York Stock Exchange, Refinitiv, Square, State Street, and the Western Union are all part of the Financial Services Data Cloud. We also launched Media Data Cloud, which enables media and advertising companies to share data for audience insights and measurements. With data clean rooms enabled by Snowflake, advertisers, agencies, and publishers can design their own collaborative environments. The Media Data Cloud includes industry leaders like Disney Advertising Sales, Experian, Horizon Media, and The Trade Desk. We're teaming up with Disney Advertising Sales to provide the infrastructure underlying their new data cleanroom solution. Together, Snowflake and Disney Advertising Sales enable data collaboration for compliant and secure advertising. We launched our Powered By Snowflake program in June to help companies build and promote applications into Data Cloud. Powered By Snowflake is designed to accelerate the delivery of cloud applications on Snowflake. To-date, there are over 175 Powered By Snowflake companies who have access to technical resources to design their applications. Most recently, we announced Securonix, UiPath, VideoAmp, and ZoomInfo as Powered By Snowflake partners. In October, we held a Snowflake BUILD Summit, which focuses on software developers, data scientists, and data engineers. The event received over 20,000 registrations, which was three times last year's BUILD events. Attendees got a closer look at new applications leveraging Snowpark, which brings programmability to Snowflake and is in public preview. Developers explored how new Java user defined functions are expanding, what is possible with Snowflake. Updates to the Snowpark Accelerated program were also announced at BUILD. Snowpark Accelerated provides partners with access to technical experts and market exposure to Snowflake customers. Snowpark provides programming language choice to Snowflake's Data Cloud. Customers can access pre-built partner capabilities and integrations. It is leveraged by companies such as DataIQ, DataRobot, and H2O.ai. At our recent Snow Day event with more than 23,000 registrations, we announced that our customers can now use Python natively within Snowflake. With Snowpark for Python, developers will be able to easily program with a wildly popular language. They can also leverage the security governance of performance of Snowflake. Snowpark for Python is currently in private preview. During the quarter, Snowflake invested in Anaconda to bring enterprise-grade Python capabilities to the Data Cloud. Together, we enable the Python community to build secure data pipelines and machine learning capabilities. Anaconda partnership will enhance the Snowpark experience to extend programmability with Snowflake. Last year, we issued our first Startup Challenge; 700 companies from 56 countries competed to build a data application with Snowflake. We announced our second Snowflake Startup Challenge at BUILD with enough -- with an opportunity for up to $1 million in total investment. Snowflakes Data Marketplace grew 41% this quarter now with more than 900 data sets from over 200 providers. We also saw more than 130% annual increase in so-called stable edges. Stable edges are ongoing Snowflake data networking relationships between providers and consumers. One of the feature data sets is FactSet's tick history data feed. It provides asset managers real-time data from over 200 exchanges. ZoomInfo is another feature dataset. It provides company and contact data with no additional integration or ETL required. The overarching backdrop for Snowflake is the inexorable march towards direct-to-consumer operations and full blown digital transformation. Enterprises and institutions have grown acutely aware how much they will end up relying on data operations, data analytics, and data science. Data is becoming the beating heart of the modern enterprise. So, the race is on to lay the foundation for a digital data driven infrastructure. Snowflake is and will be a critical enabler of this journey. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. Q3 was a breakout consumption and bookings quarter for us. Our Q3 product revenues were $312 million, representing 110% year-over-year growth. Consumption continues to be led by our financial services, media, retail, and technology customers. Our outperformance is fueled by our existing customer base, which is demonstrated by our net revenue retention rate of 173%. Net revenue retention expansion is driven by rapid growth among our largest customers and the addition of six customers to the measurement cohort that have gained greater than $1 million of revenue in the past year. In Q3, five of our top 10 customers grew at or above the company's product revenue growth rate of 110% year-on-year. Q3 benefitted from record quarter-on-quarter incremental growth and we are pleased to see our largest customers continuing to expand their use of Snowflake. Q3 was also an impressive quarter of sales execution. Remaining performance obligations grew to $1.8 billion with our key industries leading net new bookings. We are also pleased with our progress to mature the sales motion to sell large multi-year deals. In the quarter, we signed a three-year $100 million deal to an existing customer, as well as five additional eight figure multi-year deals. These commitments signal organizations' intent to expand their use of Snowflake, and we look forward to seeing their consumption follow. Of the $1.8 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. We remain focused on penetrating the largest enterprises globally as we believe these organizations provide the largest opportunity for account expansion. In Q3, the number of customers with greater than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue increased to 148, up from 116 last quarter, including eight consuming more than $10 million. Q3 was also highlighted by meaningful strides in our partner ecosystem. First, our relationships with our cloud service providers in the field continued to strengthen. This fiscal year-to-date, we have co-sold over a $0.5 billion in total contract value with our cloud service providers. Second, we are seeing significant growth from our Powered By Snowflake program, with a number of registered Power by partners growing 137% quarter-on-quarter and the products revenue from those partners growing 173% year-on-year. Lastly, we are seeing growing engagement within the Data Cloud ecosystem and we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to invest through Snowflake ventures. In the quarter, we announced strategic investments in Anaconda, Overlay Analytics, and Roadway. The third quarter also some meaningful gains in profitability and efficiency. On a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 74.6% scale, larger mix of compute consumption, and increased price per credit related to greater consumption of higher price product additions drove the outperformance. Operating margin was 2.5%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and a portion of planned Q3 headcount now starting in Q4. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 6.4%, positively impacted by operating margin outperformance. As a reminder, adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of net cash paid or received on both employee and employer payroll tax-related items and employee stock transactions. This quarter we saw a $12 million positive impact from those items. We maintained our strong cash position with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments. Now, let's turn to our guidance and outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $345 million and $350 million dollars, representing year-over-year growth between 94% and 96%. Our forecast calls for our top customers to continue growing from Q3 to Q4, but not at the same record rate we saw from Q2 to Q3. Daily customer consumption patterns determine our revenue forecast. In many cases, consumption is driven by our customers own business cycles and growth patterns. In Q4 of last year, some of our largest customers experienced tremendous business growth. With holiday travel returning to a more normal cadence, we also expect a greater impact on consumption in Q4 this year than last year. Turning to margins, we expect on a non-GAAP basis, 1% operating margin and we expect 358 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. As mentioned earlier, we push some hiring into Q4, but still expect to hire more than 1,200 employees in fiscal year 2022. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $1.126 billion and $1.131 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 103% and 104%. Turning to profitability for the full year, we expect on a non-GAAP basis 74% product gross margin, negative 4% operating margin, and 8% adjusted free cash flow margin and we expect 357 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the remainder of the calendar year, we expect to remain in a predominantly remote work environment with limited travel. Our forecast reflects this plan. We're assuming an uptick of return to office expenses in the fourth quarter. While we anticipate an eventual return to the office, we do not have a specific timeline for that goal. With the Snowflake Ventures portfolio growing and strategic investments in privately held and publicly-traded securities, please keep in mind that we may see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and our mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses going forward. We expect to recognize non-cash gains of approximately $20 million in the aggregate on prior strategic investments based on transactions that have closed so far in Q4. And lastly, we will host our Investor Day in person, the week of June 13th, in conjunction with Snowflake Summit in Las Vegas. If you would like to attend, please email ir@snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. And as a reminder, Christian Kleinerman, our SVP of Products will be joining us for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We have your first question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Excuse me Raimo, your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: I should unmute myself. Thank you. Congrats from me here the -- on this really strong quarter. A question for Frank. If I look at the data sharing progress you guys are making and also looking at some of the industry conferences that are happening this week, where data sharing starts kind of to play a more bigger role. Where do you see we -- think we are on that journey in terms of other industries discovering the new world we are living in terms of sharing data in the cloud and what's possible and help different business models, different monetization models are possible, because it feels almost like we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg here. And then the question for Mike, the gross margin that you're talking about now, is that kind of the way to think about it because you've done a lot of the negotiations, or is there more room to look for in the coming years? Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: Raimo its Frank. Generally I agree with what your assessment that we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg. Snowflake was built from the ground up as a data sharing platform and we've been at it from the beginning. You see a lot of other players following our lead in this regard, but we are in the beginning. What happens a lot in our field in our business is that people look at modernizing legacy workloads. Those kinds of things often have priority over getting to data sharing, because we cannot even consider data sharing unless we get our data to the cloud, we start moving that workloads, we migrate our databases and so on. So, yes, we are in the very early stages, but as you see from the metrics that we report on, there is a very, very steady aggressive growth happening quarter-on-quarter. But we sort of haven't reached that tipping point yet where sort of the floodgates are open and things are just expanding at a meteoric rate. But we're anticipating that that will happen at some point. It's very non-linear in the way the adoptions is going to develop.\nMichael Scarpelli: And Raimo on your question on gross margins, I'm not giving guidance for next year or the longer term, we'll update that in June. All I will say is, we still have a number of deployments around the world that are not at scale, which there is upside and our margins from that coupled with as we get into these larger customer relationships that are going with our higher edition product, they do attract higher margin. Consistent what we said when we're going public, I don't think this is ever going to get into the mid-80s like some of the other SaaS companies, but clearly, our longer term guidance was 75 and there's upside to that.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you congrats again.\nOperator: We have your next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Frank actually I'm going to follow-up a little bit on Raimo's question. Are there any industries where you're starting to see network effects take hold in terms of data sharing, I know you guys have taken a little bit faster posture in terms of going more verticalizing sort of your go-to-market? I was just kind of curious in areas like financial services, are you starting to see sort of network effects build based on sort of getting some of those really key or core accounts? And then just for Mike, can you just give us an update on where you are from a hiring perspective as we head into next year, especially around sales capacity, things like that? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: Yes, Kirk, its Frank. Yes, you definitely see network effects not so much by an enterprise, by institution, but really by industry because the industry and sub-industry, they really induce and invoked a network effect because the entities have relationships and do business together. So, some of the data clouds that we announced during the quarter like the Financial Service Data Cloud, and Media and Advertising, there's a huge amount of network effect in that area. Advertising, for a lot of reasons that people know, is under enormous pressures. There's this whole movement afoot to enrich data for advertising yield and effectiveness. And when we're trying to enrich data, that then triggers data sharing and data attribution type of strategy. So, it's very strong there. But there is a difference in -- between industries. Some industries are very leading edge, they are leaning in very, very hard. Now, others just take longer and you also see by geography, it's different as well. Europe and Asia are running whatever 18, 24 months behind or so. But everybody's going to get there, just some are just more out front and others.\nMichael Scarpelli: And Kirk on your question on the hiring, I want to start by saying, we're all about quality rather than quantity of people and so we're very selective. We are slightly behind, but we're more than making that up this quarter. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we do expect to hire net 1,200 people this year and we're happy with the people we're hiring, but we will not sacrifice quality over quantity.\nKirk Materne: Thank you all.\nOperator: We have your next question from Derrick Wood with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks. Amazing quarter. I guess first one for Mike. I mean, this kind of revenue outperformance is kind of above that the parameters we've thought about, certainly above what we've seen in the past few quarters. What were the biggest outside drivers and what developments really led to this particularly -- particular quarter having such strong upside?\nMichael Scarpelli: What I would say is it was really driven by some of our largest mature customers with some things that was unique to their business that kind of surprised us on the upside. I don't think you're going to see that same repeat of a beat. At least I'm not expecting that. I'm sure you guys would love it, but I just don't see that happening this quarter. As we said before, a 5% to 7% beat is a big beat for us with our model. So, it was exceptional performance last quarter. I'm actually disappointed we outperform that much to be honest with you.\nDerrick Wood: Well, it's a good problem. Yes. Well, that's good color. Maybe Frank, you call that this Media Data Cloud and how you're helping advertisers and marketers harness more first party data is what I read in that release. And I guess, given all the developments going around IDFA and cracking down on third-party, and really the push to try to monetize first party, what kind of opportunity do you see and collecting and powering that first party data in the media and entertainment and other B2C industries?\nFrank Slootman: It's really rippling through the entire economy, right? I mean you really got a sort of viewed it in the context of the whole world going direct-to-consumer. Every industry is -- even people that have historically not been direct-to-consumer are moving towards direct-to-consumer. Now that obviously triggers enormous investments and people trying to get up to speed on data operation, data science, and being able to run a real data-driven enterprise. In order to do that, we need to have very, very, very refined data enrichment strategies to really tune and optimize and make these relationships work. And that's what's fueling this enormous focus on data sharing and being able -- people being able to enrich their data with attributes that come from other sources. So, the ability to own your own data as an institution, as an enterprise, and to fully operationalize and mobilize is going to become incredibly important. I mean, even industries that historically have not been direct-to-consumer, think of retail and things of that sort, retail, obviously, the brick-and-mortar type, they're all changing now under the influence of the likes of Instacart and DoorDash. So, it's all changing. So, the interaction method is becoming digital, just is a real tailwind for companies like Snowflake.\nDerrick Wood: Yes, very exciting. Okay, thanks.\nOperator: We have your next question from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. What a spectacular quarter. Frank, curious to get your thoughts on the Fortune 500 count base that you have, you have 223 customers, you also have at the same time about 148 customers that are doing over million dollar in product revenue. What is the overlap here? And how much more of a potential do you have in the Fortune 500 space because I'm surprised that when you look at the overall revenue of the company divided by the number of customers, it's about -- it's a relatively smaller number relative to where the company can gain in terms of market share versus broader enterprise software companies generally could sell up to a million dollars per account, it seems to me that the penetration wallet share is quite low, which leaves a lot of opportunity. Can you just address that overlap between the million dollar customers and the Fortune 500 base and how much more potential there is with large accounts? Thank you so much.\nFrank Slootman: Yes, Kash I agree with your statement. I mean we are -- we have footprint, but we're very marginally penetrated, which is great. That's exactly what we look for. We typically when we start out with customer Fortune 500, or otherwise, it's a whole process that spans a long period of time; it's a journey, it's a relationship, that you're going. They're legacy workloads, they are new projects, and it's something that grows and grows and grows. And you very clearly see that in our net revenue retention rates, that people are literally evolving and learning and expanding as they go along. They may not have a very clear view of what they will be doing when, but they're literally learning and exploring as they go along. The other thing that I would say is that we shouldn't sort of view things in the historical way that all the money is going to come from Fortune 500 companies, this is absolutely not the case. I mean you'll be stumped if you look at the number of customers that we -- who are not Fortune 500, and how high their revenue contribution is. And that's because these are newer enterprises, they are born in the cloud, digital, direct-to-consumer oriented and they have a very different culture towards data, very different orientation. They will definitely feature very, very prominently in our business mix, doesn't mean that Fortune 500 isn't important, obviously is, but their adoption as traditional enterprises is often not as fast as a newer entities that we're dealing with.\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much. One follow-up for you Mike, quickly as a result of the profitability inflection we're seeing in the business, does that make you more confident and maybe potentially think about raising the long-term cash flow margin goal that you outlined a few months back? Thank you so much.\nMichael Scarpelli: We will be updating our long-term guidance at our Investor Day. I clearly do think there is upside to both our operating margin and free cash flow margin and we will update it at that time.\nKash Rangan: Splendid. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We have your next question from DJ Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nDavid Hynes: Hey, thanks guys and yes, congrats on the results, really impressive. Again the standout to me is the net revenue retention. So, Frank, I guess the question is as you think about driving growth in the phase, where does the discovery of new use cases typically come from? Is it mostly customer-led? How much can sales influence that expansion process? And I guess, like, longer term, do you think you have to build out a customer success layer over time, I would love to just get your thoughts as you think about how this evolves over time?\nFrank Slootman: First off, the entire company is a customer success layer, okay. That is not a department or a function in our world. There are some predictable ways in which things happen. But it depends on the type of enterprises that we deal with. Historically, we've worked on legacy workloads, on-premise workloads, and we have a very predictable pattern, moving data to the cloud and migrating databases. That is a tried and true part of our business. Others -- and this is a reason why verticalization is such an important trend is -- that has very little to do with legacy workloads, it has everything to do with preparing companies for their digital direct-to-consumer futures where they're trying to really mobilize data, monetize data and make data really the core of what they're doing. And that is not just in -- those are not just in enterprises that you typically think of, but even in enterprises, like in retail, there are traditionally brick-and-mortar to become very, very focused on their data -- on the data that they have, the value that it has, and how they monetize that. So, these are very, very big things that are happening. Everybody's realizing they're sitting on something extraordinarily valuable if they can enrich it and mobilize it in the right way. So, demand comes from many different places, the sales organizations are -- over the last year, are being redirected to really understand the customer's context. What are their challenges? What are people doing? What are people not doing? How are they approaching it? So, that we can bring that value to our customers. So, it's no longer hey, here's our architecture versus the next guy, less benchmark and POC these workloads, see how they do? That was historically what Snowflake did? Now, we're completely leaned into the customers' context, what are their issues, their challenges? And we are becoming expert at their business and that is a big evolution, it's very exciting because it also elevates us inside the enterprise. We're no longer talking exclusively to IT types and CIOs and so on, but we're now talking to the business side of IT, this is a very different conversation.\nDavid Hynes: Yes, that makes sense. It's helpful color. And then Mike as a follow-up, so you made some comments with respect to how you're thinking about Q4 consumption patterns. And it made me think about complexities and forecasting a business like this. So, I guess the question really is, do you find that it's getting easier or harder to model the business as it scales? I mean I feel like, on the one hand, you probably benefit from customer diversity and additional data points around usage patterns. But on the other, you're constantly trying to figure out kind of the patterns of new customers. So, clearly, some puts and takes there. I would just love to get your thoughts.\nMichael Scarpelli: I think it's getting better and I've been very happy and I think the Q3 performance relative to our internal forecast is specific to some very large customers. Other than that, we've been pretty accurate with what we gave the field at the beginning of the year consumption by customer forecasts. I'm pretty pleased with that and it does get easier as we have a larger and larger customer base. So -- and beautiful thing is we use Snowflake to help our modeling.\nDavid Hynes: There you go. Proof is in the pudding. Thank you guys.\nOperator: We have your next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Yes, thank you very much and I'll add my congrats on a thrilling quarter. Frank, I recalled it when the pandemic hit about a year and a half ago, you actually saw pretty healthy consumption trends because companies had to analyze data just to try to respond to the environment. I'm wondering -- and Mike, you referenced some activities specific to larger customers, are there any similar developments that are driving extra consumption today or in Q3, for instance, maybe frozen global supply chains or -- are driving activity for retailers or maybe this the new variant in pharma or inflation and interest rate volatility kind of driving some activity in Financial Services?\nMichael Scarpelli: When I look at the outperformance across our company, the outperformance is really being driven by a number of large customers whose businesses are growing dramatically, plus a couple of our Fortune 500 customers that are doing some specific things, is really what's driving it. So, I can't say it has anything to do with the pandemic supply chain, pharma looking at things based upon the customers that I see that had a really large outperformance. That doesn't mean there's not any of that our customer base, but I just don't see that as the biggest drivers of our outperformance.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Then Mike as a quick follow-up, when we look at the sequential change in RPO, it's quite a bit larger in Q3 than in Q2. And I was wondering if you could shed any light on that? To what extent is it driven by duration versus the booking itself, which I think you've very clearly mentioned?\nMichael Scarpelli: Well, if you recall at the end of last quarter, a lot of people picked on our RPO and I said, don't worry, it's timing and Q3 was going to have a big quarter of RPO, which we pretty much hit our targets internally as to where we thought it would be. There is timing on as an example, our first $100 million deal we did in 2020, clearly, that customer is not renewing every year because it's in RPO. We will do some big deals this quarter too, we expect Q4 is going to be a big RPO addition. But at the end of the day, it's about RPO and isolation, it's revenue and it's more current RPO that is more meaningful.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nMichael Scarpelli: And give you that 55% we estimate will be recognized over the next 12 months.\nMark Murphy: Got it. Thank you\nOperator: We have your next question from Greg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGreg Moskowitz: All right. Thank you. Congrats on a terrific quarter. So, we've been hearing more customer anecdotes to the tune of as these companies are growing, they're becoming less confident that other solutions they may be using for data warehousing, et cetera can handle their future data volumes and performance needs. And that in turn is driving more business to the Snowflake platform. Is that consistent Frank with what you're seeing?\nFrank Slootman: We'll say yes.\nGreg Moskowitz: All right, that's short and sweet. And then just as a follow-up, so I wanted to ask about international because the revenue growth that you reported this quarter was pretty stunning, clearly, that was a primary driver of the product revenue acceleration you showed this quarter. The question here is are you seeing signs of an inflection in consumption overseas? Or was this more driven by consumption from a few of those larger customers that surprised you this quarter?\nMichael Scarpelli: What I would say first of all, is we saw real outperformance relative to plan in bookings in Asia and EMEA. We also had a very, very strong North America, but off a much higher plan. Yes, in our top 10, we have one European customer that is our largest and is growing very, very fast. But still the majority of our growth in revenue is coming from our North American customers. But we do see next year and beyond EMEA, in particular, and Asia starting to derive some of that as well too.\nGreg Moskowitz: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We have your next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much guys and just phenomenal quarter, unbelievable results, even though I know Mike, you're disappointed in how good they are. Maybe a question for you, Mike, I think you called out if I got it right, a half a billion booked in partnership with CSP partners. And I just wanted to ask how has -- obviously good, but how is the evolution of the go-to-market been with those partners, and specifically, customers when they consume pre-purchased cloud credits by way of the CSPs, does that ever hit your RPO? And is that a factor we should be thinking about?\nMichael Scarpelli: So, first of all, I think it's going well with some of the CSPs and of that -- and said it was over half a billion to-date that we co-sold with them. I would say AWS is -- the majority of that, followed by Microsoft. Google is pretty much zero in that co-sell. But we still are adding more and more -- our number of customers in GCP continues to increase. And -- sorry, Brad, what was the other part of your question?\nBrad Zelnick: It was just if customers consume pre-purchase cloud credits they have--\nMichael Scarpelli: Yes, so some customers choose to go through marketplace, others choose to go direct. They generally choose to go to marketplace so they can draw down their commit with the cloud provider, that would still show up in RPO because we still get the contract from the customer. We just do the invoicing and everything through marketplace for them.\nBrad Zelnick: Got it, that's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up perhaps for Christian. I just look back historically and price performance has always been a key purchasing criteria in the database market. And I feel like Snowflake has done a phenomenal job elevating the discussion to a much higher plane. But I noticed off-late, there have been some competitive claims regarding performance. I'm just curious if A, how much of a priority or criteria is this across your typical sales cycle? And B, what if anything, should we know about TPC benchmarks and Snowflake's competitiveness from a performance perspective?\nChristian Kleinerman: So hi, Brad, Christian here. I think that at all points in time in Snowflake, we're investing in performance. Every part of the system is getting faster and lower latency. But we're always looking at is of a price performance of customer workloads. Many of us at Snowflake have been in the industry long enough to know that the TPC benchmarks end up being again with synthetic evaluations that very quickly get diverse from customer benefits. And at Snowflake, we're 100% focused on price performance for our customers, but it's not just price performance, its everything else, it's the collaboration and the data sharing that was mentioned as well as the data governance. That's how we think about the broader Data Cloud.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thanks so much guys and congrats.\nOperator: We have your next question from Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Your line is open.\nKamil Mielczarek: Hi everyone. Congrats on another incredible quarter and thanks for taking my question. So, I have a follow-up on some of the comments you made on the Fortune 500 customers. So, now close to half of them -- well, you have close to half of the Fortune 500 customers today, but only about 15% of them are generating $1 million or more in revenue. So, is it fair -- is it a fair expectation that most of them can reach and exceed that $1 million level in the next few years? And secondly, you said that it takes about nine months for your customers to reach that contractually targeted revenue. For your $1 million customers, how long does it take on average for them to move from that contract signing to that $1 million? And given you're landing larger customers now, do you expect that duration to come down over time?\nMichael Scarpelli: Well, it depends on the customer. Most customers don't sign a million dollar capacity one deal, they typically will sign -- I think if you look at our average deal size is somewhere around $50,000 initially signing a customer. And so clearly, it takes some time. Yes, we signed some large customers in cap ones, but on average, it's not. We think, on average, when we laid out our model, at our Analyst Day last year, that we think we can get to our customers paying us over a million dollars a year, on average, that will be $5.5 million, right now that 148 customers on average is $3.5 million. Clearly, the fact that we have 223 Fortune 500, those are only on average right now doing $1.250 million. There's a lot of upside in those numbers because it takes time to ramp these guys. And those have been added in the last couple years and it will take time.\nKamil Mielczarek: That's great color. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, it's nice to see the positive operating income. We've talked in the past about Snowflake being in growth mode. So, given now you're broken even, can you update us on how you're thinking about balancing margin expansion versus reinvesting in the business and specifically your headcount growth is roughly in line with last year. Can we see that accelerate if your margin starts to expand faster than expected?\nMichael Scarpelli: So, we laid out our long-term model at our Analyst Day last year, we will update that again in June. But I will reiterate again, we are a growth company, but it's not growth at all cost. We will only spend money if we think it makes sense. And as I said before, we are hiring what we think is the right pace to get quality people in the door.\nKamil Mielczarek: Great. Thanks again.\nOperator: We have your next question from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. I guess I'm going to stick with the threat of accelerating product growth, rarely do we see companies at this scale delivering accelerating growth. I know you called out large customers, called out a couple of special projects within the Fortune 500. But as you just think about the composition of consumption in the quarter and the acceleration outside of those things, do you think the business could have accelerated even at and maintain triple-digit growth even without those anomalies this quarter, just trying to double click around the acceleration you saw on the product side?\nMichael Scarpelli: Well, our over achievement is partially driven by these large customers. We did see generally across the Board, most of our customers have been exceeding their targets. Yes, there are some that are down that happen every quarter, but there's a lot more that were above their forecasts. So, it's hard to say Brent, but yes, I do think we still would have -- if I pulled out a couple of those big customers with their growth, we still would have been over 100% growth.\nBrent Bracelin: Perfect, very clear. And then just you mentioned product add-ons as one of the contributing factors to improving product gross margins this quarter. Can you maybe give a little color on what one or two of the more popular product add-ons that are kind of returning [ph]?\nMichael Scarpelli: Well, we really don't have -- we have one product, Brent, I said product addition. So, we have -- if you recall, we have a standard enterprise Business Critical. And yes, we have virtual private Snowflake too, but not as many customers use that because they're comfortable from a security going with Business Critical and it's more of our larger customers using enterprise or Business Critical that drive margin and those additions have more features associated with them.\nBrent Bracelin: Got it, very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: We have your next question from Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Yes hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to go back to the outperformance that you saw these two customers, just wanted to clarify, Mike, was it something that was kind of one-time in nature or was this just projects that it happened a lot faster? And so kind of the new run rate is faster and you're just not expecting that type of dynamic to play out going forward?\nMichael Scarpelli: One of the customers I know does a big project every year at that time of the year and it seemed to have consumed more. The others, I just don't expect them to grow, they're still going to grow their consumption. But I don't think they're going to grow their consumption at the same rate. And a lot of that is because we are seeing and we did see over the Thanksgiving holiday more people take vacation, and add our customers, which does have an impact on their business and how they use Snowflake. And we do expect over Christmas, there's -- and New Year's, there's going to be more people as well taking more vacation and we do recognize revenue on a daily basis. And we do see dips in our customer consumption on those days. This is the highest holiday quarter of any quarter.\nTyler Radke: Yes, helpful. And maybe this one's for Frank. I mean clearly the results are really strong, nothing to really pick out. I think when you talked about some of the verticals, you called out Media Tech, Retail, that that were particularly strong. If you think about maybe the verticals that were less strong, like what's the biggest thing holding folks back? Is it budget, is it just kind of internal process change, hiring environment, just give us a sense on the customer constraints in verticals that are maybe not as strong?\nFrank Slootman: Well, I mean, there are verticals like, for example, I mean, we've talked about this on previous calls, the contribution they're getting from public sector is not where we think it will eventually be under real structural reasons. Why that is so and we're solving for those issues, and that business will come along. But, there is a lot of friction. I mean we're dealing with infrastructure that has existed, for a very long period of time is completely grafted into, operational processes, you don't just unplug that stuff and plug something new, and then you're off to the races, right? These are generational shifts and transitions that enterprises are taking. So, it's not like throwing the switch. These are very, very carefully orchestrated transitions over a long period of time, takes a lot of resources, takes a lot of people. And then once they sort of get to the other side, yes, then you see the acceleration happening. We see that over and over again, that once they are re-platformed, then all of a sudden, because of the nature of the Snowflake platform itself, sky's the limit, because the platform is so accommodating of so many different workloads, and it just works. So, then the friction is -- we've gone from a lot of friction to almost no friction, but sometimes due to our customers should rim [ph], because things are running, running away from them maybe a little bit too quickly, and we helped them with that. But that's really what Snowflake does. Once you get on the platform, the friction is very, very low to spinning up new workloads and new projects and new programs and that's what you see as benefiting from.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: We have your next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I think this one is for Mike, but when I'm looking at your guys' results, I mean, you guys have been doing really well for an extended period of time and this quarter was pretty remarkable. But it seems like in the last two quarters, you've seen if anything, like an upward inflection in terms of the dollar-based net expansion rate improving and like your willingness to kind of bring up the sort of out-quarter guides and sort of like it's more of B and big raise cadence now than it was in the initial quarters out of the gate. Is there something that changed two quarters ago that that gave you guys more visibility or more competence in the business or that inflected in the business that that explains what we're kind of seeing the numbers here?\nMichael Scarpelli: I think it's a couple things. One, we talked about that when Frank came on board pre going public, we really shifted to going after some of the largest companies in the world, not that we weren't going after them before. But I would say we -- more aggressively the way we lined up for salesforce. And it takes a number of years to ramp those customers and we're seeing a lot of these companies starting to mature right now. Two, a lot of the things we've been doing with new product features like Snowpark and the Powered By, we're seeing the benefits of that taking place. And not to mention the network effect with data sharing and other things that we're starting to see then stable edges. It's kind of starting to come to fruition. Sorry?\nFrank Slootman: Verticalization.\nMichael Scarpelli: Verticalization is the other one too. That whole media cloud, that is a huge thing for us, not to mention, Financial Services cloud, and I think we're getting much better our salespeople at selling the business value into those verticals.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. And maybe one follow-up. If there are investor concerns around Snowflake, and there's not too many investor concerns, but it's within consumption models, the bills could build up pretty quickly. And you guys see that in terms of your customers get pretty -- some of your customers get pretty big pretty fast. But we've seen in examples of where customers get sticker shock over time and it becomes kind of bad marketing and difficult for companies to deal with. How do you guys avoid that? How do you sort of ensure that that your customers are seeing value from the solution, but don't get that sticker shock that the consumption model could bring up? Hey, listen, we're using more of this than what we had expected.\nFrank Slootman: This is Frank. One of the great things about running a consumption model is that we charge back who is spending the compute, which business units. So, business units can decide where they want to run this workload, how often they want to run it, how they want to provision it. So, they're really in charge. It's not sort of a runaway utility model, people can selectively decide which workloads they want to run and what is the business case for it and that's the way it's supposed to work. That really mitigates the sticker shock, people can make investment decisions as they go along and as it warms it, we're seeing with some of our large banking customers as they went from recomputing loan rates on a monthly basis to doing it every night, while they had a business case for. Does it cost money? Yes, it costs money. So, in other words, we -- what's really happening in the beginning, people have sticker shock, yes, because that goes from x to 2x to 10x, or whatever it is, that we're really resetting what is normal and what is appropriate spent for this class of computing. It is very different than what it historically has been, because of, A, what we're now capable of, but B also the necessity, given the comments that we made earlier about direct -- the trend of direct-to-consumer and full on digital transformation. Now, you can choose to sit on your heels and wait it out, but I wouldn't recommend that.\nMichael Scarpelli: Yes, I'll also add to is we really stress with customers to take training on how best practices around how to use Snowpark [ph], how to optimize your queries, and we go into our largest customers. And I'll tell you last quarter, one of our top 10 customers, we saw a big decrease in their consumption, more than what we were forecasting. Why? Because our RSAs went in there and helped optimize that customer. But you want to what, when we do that, that customer then moves more workloads and we're seeing this quarter already, they're tracking ahead of our forecast, because they're using in a more optimized way and the customer sees the value they're getting out of Snowflake.\nChristian Kleinerman: Let me add a quick comment also on the topic of performance, we are very intentional that each time that we make the system faster, we're improving also the economics of Snowflake. And we hear very consistently from our customers that those are very welcome surprises where the economics of the platform are getting better without them having to do any upgrades or changes to the platform.\nKeith Weiss: Got it, that's super helpful guys. Congratulations on an awesome quarter.\nMichael Scarpelli: Thanks.\nOperator: We have your next question from Gray Powell with BTIG. Your line is open.\nJanet Zhang: Hi, this is Janet Zhang on for Gray Powell. Congrats on the corner and thanks for taking the question. So, I was wondering what do you think is the best forward-looking predictor of revenue? I know, last quarter, there was a focus on RPO, which can move around. So, how much weight do you think we should put on things like RPO or customer ads versus just the pace of net new product revenue in a given quarter?\nMichael Scarpelli: I would say the first thing is the guidance we give. The second thing is historical revenue growth patterns coupled with the current portion of RPO to build your models.\nJanet Zhang: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We have your next question from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is open.\nKarl Keirstead: Great. Maybe I'll direct this one to Christian The Data Science-ML workload opportunity seems to be huge and I think everybody on this call took notice of your Data Science related announcements at your recent Snow Day. I just wanted to ask you how ambitious Snowflake is about going after those workloads and how willing are you to go up against the likes of Databricks, DataRobot, DataIQ and others? Or do you view them more as partners? Thank you.\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes, hi, Karl. The way we think about it is we want to help our customers bring the computation to do Data Science and machine learning on to Snowflake so that they don't have to copy the data out and miss out on the benefits of data governance, et cetera. As such, the big investments we've done have been all around extensibility. That's where you see Snowpark, you see Python. And we're partnering with all the companies that you mentioned for them to drive consumption and compete on Snowflake. So, what we want is to have those solutions come and run natively on Snowflake.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, got it. Good luck chasing that opportunity. It seems material.\nChristian Kleinerman: It's very large. Yes.\nOperator: We have your last question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Frank, look forward to the book. When you think about unstructured data, I know you made an announcement to push harder here. Can you talk to us about what you're seeing from customers' interest level and are you starting to see customers go in production? Or is that a 2022 event? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks for the plug on the book there, Brent. I'm going to ask Christian to address this question.\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes, so unstructured data went into public preview at our Snow Day. We are seeing quite a bit of adoption. We're seeing images, documents, even speech recordings getting stored into Snowflake. And we're seeing customers start to leverage Snowpark to do programming in Java to get value out of those files. So, it's looking pretty good from the early adoption, the few weeks that it has been in public review.\nBrent Thill: And Mike, you mentioned Media and Financial Services as it relates to verticals, if you had kind of the next two verticals on ready, reserved, ready to take off, what would you say those are sitting on the tarmac ready to roll into 2022 if you had up in commercial?\nMichael Scarpelli: I think healthcare is going to be a big one. I think in the longer term, I do think public sector will be a big vertical we're working on. And retail is a very, very big vertical force that will take. Listen, we're doing well across the board. We're just really highlighting. We're doing exceptionally well in Media and Financial Services.\nBrent Thill: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We're I'm showing no further questions at this time. Presenters, please continue.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Scarpelli",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Q3 was a breakout consumption and bookings quarter for us. Our Q3 product revenues were $312 million, representing 110% year-over-year growth. Consumption continues to be led by our financial services, media, retail, and technology customers. Our outperformance is fueled by our existing customer base, which is demonstrated by our net revenue retention rate of 173%. Net revenue retention expansion is driven by rapid growth among our largest customers and the addition of six customers to the measurement cohort that have gained greater than $1 million of revenue in the past year. In Q3, five of our top 10 customers grew at or above the company's product revenue growth rate of 110% year-on-year. Q3 benefitted from record quarter-on-quarter incremental growth and we are pleased to see our largest customers continuing to expand their use of Snowflake. Q3 was also an impressive quarter of sales execution. Remaining performance obligations grew to $1.8 billion with our key industries leading net new bookings. We are also pleased with our progress to mature the sales motion to sell large multi-year deals. In the quarter, we signed a three-year $100 million deal to an existing customer, as well as five additional eight figure multi-year deals. These commitments signal organizations' intent to expand their use of Snowflake, and we look forward to seeing their consumption follow. Of the $1.8 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. We remain focused on penetrating the largest enterprises globally as we believe these organizations provide the largest opportunity for account expansion. In Q3, the number of customers with greater than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue increased to 148, up from 116 last quarter, including eight consuming more than $10 million. Q3 was also highlighted by meaningful strides in our partner ecosystem. First, our relationships with our cloud service providers in the field continued to strengthen. This fiscal year-to-date, we have co-sold over a $0.5 billion in total contract value with our cloud service providers. Second, we are seeing significant growth from our Powered By Snowflake program, with a number of registered Power by partners growing 137% quarter-on-quarter and the products revenue from those partners growing 173% year-on-year. Lastly, we are seeing growing engagement within the Data Cloud ecosystem and we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to invest through Snowflake ventures. In the quarter, we announced strategic investments in Anaconda, Overlay Analytics, and Roadway. The third quarter also some meaningful gains in profitability and efficiency. On a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 74.6% scale, larger mix of compute consumption, and increased price per credit related to greater consumption of higher price product additions drove the outperformance. Operating margin was 2.5%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and a portion of planned Q3 headcount now starting in Q4. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 6.4%, positively impacted by operating margin outperformance. As a reminder, adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of net cash paid or received on both employee and employer payroll tax-related items and employee stock transactions. This quarter we saw a $12 million positive impact from those items. We maintained our strong cash position with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments. Now, let's turn to our guidance and outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $345 million and $350 million dollars, representing year-over-year growth between 94% and 96%. Our forecast calls for our top customers to continue growing from Q3 to Q4, but not at the same record rate we saw from Q2 to Q3. Daily customer consumption patterns determine our revenue forecast. In many cases, consumption is driven by our customers own business cycles and growth patterns. In Q4 of last year, some of our largest customers experienced tremendous business growth. With holiday travel returning to a more normal cadence, we also expect a greater impact on consumption in Q4 this year than last year. Turning to margins, we expect on a non-GAAP basis, 1% operating margin and we expect 358 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. As mentioned earlier, we push some hiring into Q4, but still expect to hire more than 1,200 employees in fiscal year 2022. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $1.126 billion and $1.131 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 103% and 104%. Turning to profitability for the full year, we expect on a non-GAAP basis 74% product gross margin, negative 4% operating margin, and 8% adjusted free cash flow margin and we expect 357 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the remainder of the calendar year, we expect to remain in a predominantly remote work environment with limited travel. Our forecast reflects this plan. We're assuming an uptick of return to office expenses in the fourth quarter. While we anticipate an eventual return to the office, we do not have a specific timeline for that goal. With the Snowflake Ventures portfolio growing and strategic investments in privately held and publicly-traded securities, please keep in mind that we may see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and our mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses going forward. We expect to recognize non-cash gains of approximately $20 million in the aggregate on prior strategic investments based on transactions that have closed so far in Q4. And lastly, we will host our Investor Day in person, the week of June 13th, in conjunction with Snowflake Summit in Las Vegas. If you would like to attend, please email ir@snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. And as a reminder, Christian Kleinerman, our SVP of Products will be joining us for Q&A. And Raimo on your question on gross margins, I'm not giving guidance for next year or the longer term, we'll update that in June. All I will say is, we still have a number of deployments around the world that are not at scale, which there is upside and our margins from that coupled with as we get into these larger customer relationships that are going with our higher edition product, they do attract higher margin. Consistent what we said when we're going public, I don't think this is ever going to get into the mid-80s like some of the other SaaS companies, but clearly, our longer term guidance was 75 and there's upside to that. And Kirk on your question on the hiring, I want to start by saying, we're all about quality rather than quantity of people and so we're very selective. We are slightly behind, but we're more than making that up this quarter. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we do expect to hire net 1,200 people this year and we're happy with the people we're hiring, but we will not sacrifice quality over quantity. What I would say is it was really driven by some of our largest mature customers with some things that was unique to their business that kind of surprised us on the upside. I don't think you're going to see that same repeat of a beat. At least I'm not expecting that. I'm sure you guys would love it, but I just don't see that happening this quarter. As we said before, a 5% to 7% beat is a big beat for us with our model. So, it was exceptional performance last quarter. I'm actually disappointed we outperform that much to be honest with you. We will be updating our long-term guidance at our Investor Day. I clearly do think there is upside to both our operating margin and free cash flow margin and we will update it at that time. I think it's getting better and I've been very happy and I think the Q3 performance relative to our internal forecast is specific to some very large customers. Other than that, we've been pretty accurate with what we gave the field at the beginning of the year consumption by customer forecasts. I'm pretty pleased with that and it does get easier as we have a larger and larger customer base. So -- and beautiful thing is we use Snowflake to help our modeling. When I look at the outperformance across our company, the outperformance is really being driven by a number of large customers whose businesses are growing dramatically, plus a couple of our Fortune 500 customers that are doing some specific things, is really what's driving it. So, I can't say it has anything to do with the pandemic supply chain, pharma looking at things based upon the customers that I see that had a really large outperformance. That doesn't mean there's not any of that our customer base, but I just don't see that as the biggest drivers of our outperformance. Well, if you recall at the end of last quarter, a lot of people picked on our RPO and I said, don't worry, it's timing and Q3 was going to have a big quarter of RPO, which we pretty much hit our targets internally as to where we thought it would be. There is timing on as an example, our first $100 million deal we did in 2020, clearly, that customer is not renewing every year because it's in RPO. We will do some big deals this quarter too, we expect Q4 is going to be a big RPO addition. But at the end of the day, it's about RPO and isolation, it's revenue and it's more current RPO that is more meaningful. And give you that 55% we estimate will be recognized over the next 12 months. What I would say first of all, is we saw real outperformance relative to plan in bookings in Asia and EMEA. We also had a very, very strong North America, but off a much higher plan. Yes, in our top 10, we have one European customer that is our largest and is growing very, very fast. But still the majority of our growth in revenue is coming from our North American customers. But we do see next year and beyond EMEA, in particular, and Asia starting to derive some of that as well too. So, first of all, I think it's going well with some of the CSPs and of that -- and said it was over half a billion to-date that we co-sold with them. I would say AWS is -- the majority of that, followed by Microsoft. Google is pretty much zero in that co-sell. But we still are adding more and more -- our number of customers in GCP continues to increase. And -- sorry, Brad, what was the other part of your question? Yes, so some customers choose to go through marketplace, others choose to go direct. They generally choose to go to marketplace so they can draw down their commit with the cloud provider, that would still show up in RPO because we still get the contract from the customer. We just do the invoicing and everything through marketplace for them. Well, it depends on the customer. Most customers don't sign a million dollar capacity one deal, they typically will sign -- I think if you look at our average deal size is somewhere around $50,000 initially signing a customer. And so clearly, it takes some time. Yes, we signed some large customers in cap ones, but on average, it's not. We think, on average, when we laid out our model, at our Analyst Day last year, that we think we can get to our customers paying us over a million dollars a year, on average, that will be $5.5 million, right now that 148 customers on average is $3.5 million. Clearly, the fact that we have 223 Fortune 500, those are only on average right now doing $1.250 million. There's a lot of upside in those numbers because it takes time to ramp these guys. And those have been added in the last couple years and it will take time. So, we laid out our long-term model at our Analyst Day last year, we will update that again in June. But I will reiterate again, we are a growth company, but it's not growth at all cost. We will only spend money if we think it makes sense. And as I said before, we are hiring what we think is the right pace to get quality people in the door. Well, our over achievement is partially driven by these large customers. We did see generally across the Board, most of our customers have been exceeding their targets. Yes, there are some that are down that happen every quarter, but there's a lot more that were above their forecasts. So, it's hard to say Brent, but yes, I do think we still would have -- if I pulled out a couple of those big customers with their growth, we still would have been over 100% growth. Well, we really don't have -- we have one product, Brent, I said product addition. So, we have -- if you recall, we have a standard enterprise Business Critical. And yes, we have virtual private Snowflake too, but not as many customers use that because they're comfortable from a security going with Business Critical and it's more of our larger customers using enterprise or Business Critical that drive margin and those additions have more features associated with them. One of the customers I know does a big project every year at that time of the year and it seemed to have consumed more. The others, I just don't expect them to grow, they're still going to grow their consumption. But I don't think they're going to grow their consumption at the same rate. And a lot of that is because we are seeing and we did see over the Thanksgiving holiday more people take vacation, and add our customers, which does have an impact on their business and how they use Snowflake. And we do expect over Christmas, there's -- and New Year's, there's going to be more people as well taking more vacation and we do recognize revenue on a daily basis. And we do see dips in our customer consumption on those days. This is the highest holiday quarter of any quarter. I think it's a couple things. One, we talked about that when Frank came on board pre going public, we really shifted to going after some of the largest companies in the world, not that we weren't going after them before. But I would say we -- more aggressively the way we lined up for salesforce.

Verticalization is the other one too. That whole media cloud, that is a huge thing for us, not to mention, Financial Services cloud, and I think we're getting much better our salespeople at selling the business value into those verticals. Yes, I'll also add to is we really stress with customers to take training on how best practices around how to use Snowpark [ph], how to optimize your queries, and we go into our largest customers. And I'll tell you last quarter, one of our top 10 customers, we saw a big decrease in their consumption, more than what we were forecasting. Why?

            "content": "So hi, Brad, Christian here. I think that at all points in time in Snowflake, we're investing in performance. Every part of the system is getting faster and lower latency. But we're always looking at is of a price performance of customer workloads. Many of us at Snowflake have been in the industry long enough to know that the TPC benchmarks end up being again with synthetic evaluations that very quickly get diverse from customer benefits. And at Snowflake, we're 100% focused on price performance for our customers, but it's not just price performance, its everything else, it's the collaboration and the data sharing that was mentioned as well as the data governance. That's how we think about the broader Data Cloud.

            "content": "Thanks Jimmy. Good afternoon everybody. We saw momentum accelerate in Q3 with product revenues growing 110% year-on-year to $312 million and remaining performance obligations growing to $1.8 billion. The net revenue retention rate expanded to 173% and we recorded our first positive non-GAAP operating income in the company's history. Our Q3 Fortune 500 customer count totaled 223, increasing by eight in the quarter and we now have 148 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million. Our growth is driven by a diverse mix of customers, the 10 largest consumers in Q3 include four Fortune 500 companies, four companies less than 10 years old, and a Powered By Snowflake program partner. We continued our international expansion with product revenue from EMEA and Asia-Pacific outstripping the company's year-on-year growth, up 174% and 219% respectively. We recently launched operations in three new countries Israel, Korea, and the United Arab Emirates. Vertical industry focus is an important evolution of our selling motion, especially in global enterprise accounts. During the quarter, we announced two industry data clouds. The Financial Services Data Cloud brings together to Snowflake platform partner solutions and industry data to help financial services organizations mobilize their data. Customers can launch products, build FinTech platforms, and accelerate their compliance on top of Snowflake. Industry leading customers Allianz, Blackrock, Capital One, New York Stock Exchange, Refinitiv, Square, State Street, and the Western Union are all part of the Financial Services Data Cloud. We also launched Media Data Cloud, which enables media and advertising companies to share data for audience insights and measurements. With data clean rooms enabled by Snowflake, advertisers, agencies, and publishers can design their own collaborative environments. The Media Data Cloud includes industry leaders like Disney Advertising Sales, Experian, Horizon Media, and The Trade Desk. We're teaming up with Disney Advertising Sales to provide the infrastructure underlying their new data cleanroom solution. Together, Snowflake and Disney Advertising Sales enable data collaboration for compliant and secure advertising. We launched our Powered By Snowflake program in June to help companies build and promote applications into Data Cloud. Powered By Snowflake is designed to accelerate the delivery of cloud applications on Snowflake. To-date, there are over 175 Powered By Snowflake companies who have access to technical resources to design their applications. Most recently, we announced Securonix, UiPath, VideoAmp, and ZoomInfo as Powered By Snowflake partners. In October, we held a Snowflake BUILD Summit, which focuses on software developers, data scientists, and data engineers. The event received over 20,000 registrations, which was three times last year's BUILD events. Attendees got a closer look at new applications leveraging Snowpark, which brings programmability to Snowflake and is in public preview. Developers explored how new Java user defined functions are expanding, what is possible with Snowflake. Updates to the Snowpark Accelerated program were also announced at BUILD. Snowpark Accelerated provides partners with access to technical experts and market exposure to Snowflake customers. Snowpark provides programming language choice to Snowflake's Data Cloud. Customers can access pre-built partner capabilities and integrations. It is leveraged by companies such as DataIQ, DataRobot, and H2O.ai. At our recent Snow Day event with more than 23,000 registrations, we announced that our customers can now use Python natively within Snowflake. With Snowpark for Python, developers will be able to easily program with a wildly popular language. They can also leverage the security governance of performance of Snowflake. Snowpark for Python is currently in private preview. During the quarter, Snowflake invested in Anaconda to bring enterprise-grade Python capabilities to the Data Cloud. Together, we enable the Python community to build secure data pipelines and machine learning capabilities. Anaconda partnership will enhance the Snowpark experience to extend programmability with Snowflake. Last year, we issued our first Startup Challenge; 700 companies from 56 countries competed to build a data application with Snowflake. We announced our second Snowflake Startup Challenge at BUILD with enough -- with an opportunity for up to $1 million in total investment. Snowflakes Data Marketplace grew 41% this quarter now with more than 900 data sets from over 200 providers. We also saw more than 130% annual increase in so-called stable edges. Stable edges are ongoing Snowflake data networking relationships between providers and consumers. One of the feature data sets is FactSet's tick history data feed. It provides asset managers real-time data from over 200 exchanges. ZoomInfo is another feature dataset. It provides company and contact data with no additional integration or ETL required. The overarching backdrop for Snowflake is the inexorable march towards direct-to-consumer operations and full blown digital transformation. Enterprises and institutions have grown acutely aware how much they will end up relying on data operations, data analytics, and data science. Data is becoming the beating heart of the modern enterprise. So, the race is on to lay the foundation for a digital data driven infrastructure. Snowflake is and will be a critical enabler of this journey. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Raimo its Frank. Generally I agree with what your assessment that we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg. Snowflake was built from the ground up as a data sharing platform and we've been at it from the beginning. You see a lot of other players following our lead in this regard, but we are in the beginning. What happens a lot in our field in our business is that people look at modernizing legacy workloads. Those kinds of things often have priority over getting to data sharing, because we cannot even consider data sharing unless we get our data to the cloud, we start moving that workloads, we migrate our databases and so on. So, yes, we are in the very early stages, but as you see from the metrics that we report on, there is a very, very steady aggressive growth happening quarter-on-quarter. But we sort of haven't reached that tipping point yet where sort of the floodgates are open and things are just expanding at a meteoric rate. But we're anticipating that that will happen at some point. It's very non-linear in the way the adoptions is going to develop. Yes, Kirk, its Frank. Yes, you definitely see network effects not so much by an enterprise, by institution, but really by industry because the industry and sub-industry, they really induce and invoked a network effect because the entities have relationships and do business together. So, some of the data clouds that we announced during the quarter like the Financial Service Data Cloud, and Media and Advertising, there's a huge amount of network effect in that area. Advertising, for a lot of reasons that people know, is under enormous pressures. There's this whole movement afoot to enrich data for advertising yield and effectiveness. And when we're trying to enrich data, that then triggers data sharing and data attribution type of strategy. So, it's very strong there. But there is a difference in -- between industries. Some industries are very leading edge, they are leaning in very, very hard. Now, others just take longer and you also see by geography, it's different as well. Europe and Asia are running whatever 18, 24 months behind or so. But everybody's going to get there, just some are just more out front and others. It's really rippling through the entire economy, right? I mean you really got a sort of viewed it in the context of the whole world going direct-to-consumer. Every industry is -- even people that have historically not been direct-to-consumer are moving towards direct-to-consumer. Now that obviously triggers enormous investments and people trying to get up to speed on data operation, data science, and being able to run a real data-driven enterprise. In order to do that, we need to have very, very, very refined data enrichment strategies to really tune and optimize and make these relationships work. And that's what's fueling this enormous focus on data sharing and being able -- people being able to enrich their data with attributes that come from other sources. So, the ability to own your own data as an institution, as an enterprise, and to fully operationalize and mobilize is going to become incredibly important. I mean, even industries that historically have not been direct-to-consumer, think of retail and things of that sort, retail, obviously, the brick-and-mortar type, they're all changing now under the influence of the likes of Instacart and DoorDash. So, it's all changing. So, the interaction method is becoming digital, just is a real tailwind for companies like Snowflake. Yes, Kash I agree with your statement. I mean we are -- we have footprint, but we're very marginally penetrated, which is great. That's exactly what we look for. We typically when we start out with customer Fortune 500, or otherwise, it's a whole process that spans a long period of time; it's a journey, it's a relationship, that you're going. They're legacy workloads, they are new projects, and it's something that grows and grows and grows. And you very clearly see that in our net revenue retention rates, that people are literally evolving and learning and expanding as they go along. They may not have a very clear view of what they will be doing when, but they're literally learning and exploring as they go along. The other thing that I would say is that we shouldn't sort of view things in the historical way that all the money is going to come from Fortune 500 companies, this is absolutely not the case. I mean you'll be stumped if you look at the number of customers that we -- who are not Fortune 500, and how high their revenue contribution is. And that's because these are newer enterprises, they are born in the cloud, digital, direct-to-consumer oriented and they have a very different culture towards data, very different orientation. They will definitely feature very, very prominently in our business mix, doesn't mean that Fortune 500 isn't important, obviously is, but their adoption as traditional enterprises is often not as fast as a newer entities that we're dealing with. First off, the entire company is a customer success layer, okay. That is not a department or a function in our world. There are some predictable ways in which things happen. But it depends on the type of enterprises that we deal with. Historically, we've worked on legacy workloads, on-premise workloads, and we have a very predictable pattern, moving data to the cloud and migrating databases. That is a tried and true part of our business. Others -- and this is a reason why verticalization is such an important trend is -- that has very little to do with legacy workloads, it has everything to do with preparing companies for their digital direct-to-consumer futures where they're trying to really mobilize data, monetize data and make data really the core of what they're doing. And that is not just in -- those are not just in enterprises that you typically think of, but even in enterprises, like in retail, there are traditionally brick-and-mortar to become very, very focused on their data -- on the data that they have, the value that it has, and how they monetize that. So, these are very, very big things that are happening. Everybody's realizing they're sitting on something extraordinarily valuable if they can enrich it and mobilize it in the right way. So, demand comes from many different places, the sales organizations are -- over the last year, are being redirected to really understand the customer's context. What are their challenges? What are people doing? What are people not doing? How are they approaching it? So, that we can bring that value to our customers. So, it's no longer hey, here's our architecture versus the next guy, less benchmark and POC these workloads, see how they do? That was historically what Snowflake did? Now, we're completely leaned into the customers' context, what are their issues, their challenges? And we are becoming expert at their business and that is a big evolution, it's very exciting because it also elevates us inside the enterprise. We're no longer talking exclusively to IT types and CIOs and so on, but we're now talking to the business side of IT, this is a very different conversation. We'll say yes. Well, I mean, there are verticals like, for example, I mean, we've talked about this on previous calls, the contribution they're getting from public sector is not where we think it will eventually be under real structural reasons. Why that is so and we're solving for those issues, and that business will come along. But, there is a lot of friction. I mean we're dealing with infrastructure that has existed, for a very long period of time is completely grafted into, operational processes, you don't just unplug that stuff and plug something new, and then you're off to the races, right? These are generational shifts and transitions that enterprises are taking. So, it's not like throwing the switch. These are very, very carefully orchestrated transitions over a long period of time, takes a lot of resources, takes a lot of people. And then once they sort of get to the other side, yes, then you see the acceleration happening. We see that over and over again, that once they are re-platformed, then all of a sudden, because of the nature of the Snowflake platform itself, sky's the limit, because the platform is so accommodating of so many different workloads, and it just works. So, then the friction is -- we've gone from a lot of friction to almost no friction, but sometimes due to our customers should rim [ph], because things are running, running away from them maybe a little bit too quickly, and we helped them with that. But that's really what Snowflake does. Once you get on the platform, the friction is very, very low to spinning up new workloads and new projects and new programs and that's what you see as benefiting from. Verticalization. This is Frank. One of the great things about running a consumption model is that we charge back who is spending the compute, which business units. So, business units can decide where they want to run this workload, how often they want to run it, how they want to provision it. So, they're really in charge. It's not sort of a runaway utility model, people can selectively decide which workloads they want to run and what is the business case for it and that's the way it's supposed to work. That really mitigates the sticker shock, people can make investment decisions as they go along and as it warms it, we're seeing with some of our large banking customers as they went from recomputing loan rates on a monthly basis to doing it every night, while they had a business case for. Does it cost money? Yes, it costs money. So, in other words, we -- what's really happening in the beginning, people have sticker shock, yes, because that goes from x to 2x to 10x, or whatever it is, that we're really resetting what is normal and what is appropriate spent for this class of computing. It is very different than what it historically has been, because of, A, what we're now capable of, but B also the necessity, given the comments that we made earlier about direct -- the trend of direct-to-consumer and full on digital transformation. Now, you can choose to sit on your heels and wait it out, but I wouldn't recommend that. Thanks for the plug on the book there, Brent. I'm going to ask Christian to address this question. Thanks everyone."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Now, I would like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Mr. Jimmy Sexton, Head of Investor Relations for Snowflake. Sir, please go ahead.\nJimmy Sexton: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Snowflake's Q2 fiscal 2022 earnings call. Joining me in Bozeman, Montana, are Frank Slootman our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer; and Christian Kleinerman our Senior Vice President of Product, who will be joining us for the Q&A session. During today's call, we will review our financial results for second quarter fiscal 2022 and discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2022. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, products and features, long-term growth and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2021, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2021, that we will file with the SEC. We caution you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations. We'd also like to point out that on today's call, we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. To see the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings press release distributed earlier today and our investor presentation, which are both posted on investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks, Jimmy. Good afternoon, everybody. We saw continued momentum in Q2 with 103% year-on-year growth to $255 million in product revenues, reflecting strength in Snowflake consumption. Remaining performance obligations grew to $1.5 billion indicating strength in sales. For the first half of fiscal '22, total revenues were $501 million, up 107% year-on-year. As the net revenue retention rate reached 169%, we also saw non-GAAP product gross margin and operating margin efficiency improved to 73.6% from negative 8% respectively. Adjusted free cash flow was positive for the third quarter in a row. As we approached the $1 billion mark in annual revenues, we continue to add customers at a robust pace adding 458 net new customers, up from 397 in Q2 of last year. With a focus on the largest organizations or Fortune 500 count totaled 212, increasing by 18 in the quarter. We are addressing the largest enterprises globally with a vertical industry approach. We see these investments yield strong results. In Q2, financial services customer product revenue grew more than 100% year-on-year, representing the largest contribution, while healthcare customer product revenue grew nearly 200%. We have engaged in targeted industry events for these verticals and we'll continue to go-to market with tailored business outcomes. We are pleased with our geographical expansion outside of the United States for product revenue from EMEA and Asia Pacific, outstripping the company's growth as a whole, growing 185% and 170% year-on-year, respectively. One of our largest new customer signed in the quarter came from Asia Pacific. During Q2, we had key enterprise wins, including AllianceBernstein, Constellation Brands, and Lithia Motors.  Following milestones, we think are worthy of note.  In Q2, we announced public preview availability in all AWS regions of Snowpark, our new developer experience. Snowpark enables developers to work in their preferred programming language in formats, including Java and Scala. Snowpark is designed to make building complex data pipelines and applications easy, and allow developers to interact with Snowflake directly without having to extract data, maximizing governance. The Snowflake accelerated program has over 50 partners enrolled to bring their capabilities and innovations across data science, data engineering, and security to Snowpark. In the future, Snowpark will add support for pipeline and expand to Azure and Google Cloud regions. Python is the most widely used programming language for machine learning and data science generally. We also launched Powered by Snowflake in June to help companies build, operate, and grow applications in the Data Cloud. Powered by Snowflake is designed to accelerate delivery of differentiated applications on Snowflake by supporting developers across all stages of the application journey in Snowflake's Data Cloud. Today, there are over 80 Powered By partners, including founding members, BlackRock, Adobe, Lacework, Observe, and OppLoans. Increasingly, application providers are enabling their apps to operate directly against their customer Snowflake accounts, meaning no data needs to be copied or replicated, simplifying data governance while accelerating the network effect of the Data Cloud. We also continued to deliver new capabilities to strengthen data governance for our customers. During the quarter, we made row access policies generally available. Data governance features are typically the broadest and fastest adopted feature across our customer base. Snowflake's increasing focus on vertical industries is leading to more deeper discussions with customers globally. Snowflake team is organized around the following core verticals. They are financial services, healthcare and life sciences, retail and CPG, advertising, media and entertainment, technology, public sector, education and manufacturing. This vertical industry focus will continue to intensify and expand over time. One example of our vertical approach is the advertising industry, which is facing new regulations and increasing pressure to strengthen consumer privacy. Advertisers want to compete in a market dominated by the walled gardens. The Snowflake Data Cloud is empowering large media companies, technology providers, and marketers to collaborate with their data assets across the ecosystem. Snowflake's data clean room solutions can enable companies to share and join data without copying or moving their data assets. Snowflake's Data Cloud powers these data clean rooms with transparency and privacy controls for customers like Disney and NBCUniversal. Each customer is creating their own data network within the Snowflake Data Cloud for their advertising businesses. Snowflake continues to deliver performance and optimization improvements throughout the platform, from improving storage efficiencies, lower ingestion latencies to faster query performance across different workloads. Performance improvements bring not only timelier insights, but improve the economics of our platform for our customers. Finally, Data Cloud adoption is growing rapidly. The Data Cloud is the sum of all data networking relationships that are active at any point in time. We track these data relationships through what we call edges. We added over 450 customers in the quarter and continue to expand the number of customers with stable edges. At the end of the quarter, 16% of our customers had stabilized edges in place with external Snowflake accounts compared to 15% last quarter. The total number of these stable edges grew more than 20% quarter over quarter. This growth is fueled by the content on our marketplace, which saw listings grow 32% quarter-over-quarter. The Data Cloud enables our customers to enrich their data, gain more effective analytical insight, and do so faster and more cost effectively. Strategically, Snowflake is emerging as a highly secure, compliant, global and efficient data network in the infrastructure across the major public cloud domains. The combination of world-class data workload execution with cloud application development, cross-cloud operations, data and data application marketplaces as well as planned monetization is what makes Snowflake stand out. During the quarter, we hosted our Annual Snowflake Summit to share our Data Cloud strategy, platform optimizations, feature enhancements and vertical industry use cases. Over 60,000 folks registered for the three-day event. We had four industry executive sessions and more than 60 customer sessions. Snowflake was launched in preview with over 50 partners supporting the Snowpark Accelerated program. And we announced OverlayAnalytics as the winner of the first Snowflake Startup Challenge. In Q3, we will be hosting events, including the Snowflake Financial Services Data Summit across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific, where we'll be sharing more of how Snowflake is connecting the entire financial services ecosystem. Snowflake is a sponsor at Ad Week, where we will discuss our enhanced advertising media and entertainment offerings. And finally, Snowflake is holding our BUILD event for technical executives, including CTOs, VPs of engineering, data scientists, data engineers, and application developers. In closing, our results demonstrate high-quality durable growth, coupled with improving efficiency and we're looking forward to executing the second half of the year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. We saw continued strength across the board in Q2 with great sales execution and operational efficiencies, setting us up for a strong back half of the year. Our Q2 product revenues were $255 million, representing 103% year-over-year growth. Consumption outperformance was led by our financial services customers, with continued strength from our technology and healthcare verticals. Our rapid growth is driven by our existing customer base. The expansion of our net revenue retention rate to 169% is indicative of the power of our product over time, as well as our sales team driving long-term business outcomes. Q2 was an impressive quarter of sales execution. Remaining performance obligations grew to $1.529 billion, with net new bookings led by the technology and financial services verticals. We are still maturing sales organization to sell multi-year contracts, and the timing of the largest multi-year deals will be lumpy. As a reminder, in Q2 last year, we sold our largest multi-year contract ever, a three-year $100 million deal. While the multi-year component of new booking sets up a difficult comparison, we saw a net - we saw new annualized contract value accelerate compared to the year ago period. This is why RPO and revenue must be evaluated together in a consumption-based business model. Of the $1.5 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 56% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, representing approximately $87 million increase quarter-over-quarter. We remain focused on penetrating the largest enterprises globally as we believe these organizations provide the largest opportunity for account expansion. In Q2, the number of customers with greater than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue increased to 116, up from 104 last quarter. The second quarter was a breakout quarter for us in terms of profitability and efficiency. On a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 73.6%, up 140 basis points from last quarter. Increased price per credit related to higher price addition consumption and higher-than-expected compute as a percent of revenue from improved storage compression mentioned last quarter drove the outperformance. We have confidence in our ability to show leverage over time, but we view this significant quarter-over-quarter increase as one-time in nature. Operating margin was negative 8%, benefiting from revenue outperformance. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 1%, positively impacted by strong linearity in bookings and operating margin outperformance. Going forward, we believe we will remain adjusted free cash flow positive. As a reminder, adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of net cash paid or received on both employee and employer payroll taxes related items on employee stock transactions. This quarter, we saw a $15 million impact from those items. We maintained a strong cash position with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Now let's turn to our guidance and outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $280 million and $285 million, representing year-over-year growth between 89% and 92%. Turning to margins. We expect, on a non-GAAP basis, negative 7% operating margin, and we expect 303 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full-year fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $1.06 billion and $1.07 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 91% and 93%. Turning to profitability for the full year. We expect, on a non-GAAP basis, 73% product gross margins, negative 9% operating margin and 7% adjusted free cash flow margin. And we expect 300 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our outlook assumes that we will still add more than 1,200 net new employees during the fiscal year. With respect to COVID, our forecast now assumes that we will most likely continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future, and we have paused most travel with a slight uptick of return to office expenses in the fourth quarter. While we anticipate an eventual return to the office, we do not have a specific time line for that goal. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. As a reminder, Christian Kleinerman, our SVP of Product, will be joining us for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much. And congratulations on a solid first half of the year. Frank, how many of your Fortune 500 type customers are in discussions with you today with some kind of a plan to build their own Data Cloud, for instance, in energy cloud or an insurance cloud or a retail cloud that uses Snowflake's data-sharing model? And then I have a quick follow-up for Mike.\nFrank Slootman: I don't have an exact authoritative number to report back to you. But I can tell you that I'm involved in those conversations on a daily basis. We lead with a value proposition literally in every conversation. We're betting 1,000 when we go down the Data Cloud path. So, we're super excited by the way this is resonating with our future customers. Now that said, the way our market has historically worked, people have had a workload attitude and mentality to the world in terms of moving to the cloud. So sometimes the data cloud is viewed as something that is sort of Phase 2 or Phase 3. People are first preoccupied with moving data to the cloud, then moving workloads to the cloud and then having sort of pulling up and having a look at what's next. We're working very hard to make sure that we look at the Data Cloud right from the beginning. And the real reason is what you don't want to do, and this is what we tell every single customer that we meet with is to recreate the silos of the past in the cloud because they'll find the exact same set of challenges that they have today. So, the Data Cloud conversation has to happen upfront to prevent people from re-siloing their data and really selling themselves short on the potential of data sciences, machine learning, and all the advanced analytics capabilities that are coming down the pike.\nMark Murphy: Thank you, Frank. And then Mike, you spent a little time talking about the RPO. I wanted to ask you on the next 12 months portion of RPO that we understand it's an estimate of future consumption. Do you have any thoughts on how to model it this year? Because if that kind of strips out the multi-year noise, just for instance, would we think about it growing in line with revenue growth or could it be slightly above, slightly below? Any framework for that?\nMichael Scarpelli: I'm not really giving that. It's been running in the low to mid-50s. And as I said, we expect 56% based on what we're seeing today. That could change. And it really changes based upon how many multi-year deals we do because, obviously, when the total RPO grows because of multi-year, that percentage could come down, but what we're seeing now is 56% we're estimating.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you for taking the questions. And congratulations on a good quarter. Frank, you called out strength in financial services. And I'm just wondering, when you look at consumption patterns, is there anything that you noticed that sort of stood out on a geo basis this quarter?\nFrank Slootman: On a geo basis, I think we're sort of experiencing traditional patterns in enterprise software adoptions, U.S. leading, EMEA following, and after that Asia-Pacific. We are actually really encouraged by the uptick in EMEA. We certainly have work to do coming into the company in terms of how we were approaching that marketplace. It's coming around really well, very pleased in what's going on in Asia Pacific as well. I mean we're really big on making sure that all our products, all our regions, all our channels are showing up every single quarter. And that's really a key focus when you're driving high growth the way we have been. So, everybody is contributing and that's - if there is a secret sauce, that's part of it.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. That's very helpful. And then just for Mike. So, you've now signed up more than 10% of the Fortune 500 over just the last 12 months. That's incredibly difficult to do. And my question here is, given the nature of your model, would it be fair to say that a very small percentage of your Q2 revenue came from these 54 relatively new Fortune 500 customers?\nMichael Scarpelli: I would say less than 1% has come from new customers we landed in the quarter. And for the full year, less than 10% will be for customers we land in the year. As a reminder, when we land these customers, it takes nine months to 12 months before they really start consuming at a rate. So, what's really driving the revenue this year are all of the customers we landed - those large customers we landed last year. And I want to stress too, it's not just those large - we have a lot of small customers that drive a lot of revenue too. It's just - the point is those large customers, they have a lot of growth potential within them still today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much. Mike, I actually want to follow up on that, on the last point you made in terms of the bigger customers taking nine months to 12 months to start consuming. How have you guys been working with sort of the ecosystem broadly to make sure that, that cadence stays on track as you add more and more of those large customers? Do you feel good that the kind of resources that are out in the market in terms of consultants, professional services, partners are out there to make sure that after you sort of land these customers, that they are on track to start consuming within sort of the approximate timeframe you laid out?\nMichael Scarpelli: Yes. So, it's been a couple of ways. It's done through our professional service people, and we probably do, I think, less than 10% of them out there. But we have a whole alliances program that's focused on all the global GSIs and the regional partners. And I think the number of those partners, including GSIs, is up 3x from what it was last year. And you can see one of the things on our professional service line, a big chunk of that is training. And we are spending a lot of time training partners, so their people can get certified doing a lot of training the trainers, so they can add more resources that are Snowflake certified to do these migrations and implementations.\nKirk Materne: And just a quick one for Frank. Frank, you guys have taken sort of a vertical approach to sales little quicker than you did at the last company - your last company. Can you just talk about the opportunities within the federal government or governments in general, sort of a big quarter for the Federal that we're all aware of? But I was just kind of curious on that vertical in particular where you think you are and maybe where you could be in 12 months, 18 months from now? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. Actually, a great question because, ironically, this wasn't true in the previous company that you referenced. Public sector is actually the slowest market for Snowflake to come along in Asia Pacific traditionally, especially Japan tend to be the slow adopters. They're actually coming around much faster than public sector is actually slower. And one of the reasons is cloud adoption in the federal government is really hard because of the standards that they have for companies like ours, and we can go on-prem. It's something that we did do at ServiceNow, as you recall. We are now getting close to approaching the requirements for broadly being able to contest federal business. We believe that federal business can become 15% of our total number. So, there is an enormous opportunity pending for us there, where we have not really effectively addressed it up to this point, but we are super confident that we are going to. There is a lot of tremendous demand there. And it's very much a procedural set of requirements that we have to grind through and it's not easy to do. So once it's there, it will also really form quite a moat or a barrier, if you will, around that type of cloud business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: First one for Frank or Christian here. We saw a noticeable uptick in the number of data lake migrations to Snowflake this quarter, clearly builds on the data warehouse migrations. But what's resonating most with enterprises that are now standardizing on Snowflake for data lake use cases, is there new feature functionality that you've added to enable that? And how big of an opportunity can that be as you think about that going forward?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes, certainly. Christian here. I think it's the breadth of the platform that we are presenting to our customers, not only performance advantages relative to alternatives, but the economic benefits that our performance represents. We hear that consistently and that has driven migration from a variety of platforms.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful. And then, Mike, as we just think about the operating margin this year, it's narrowed materially faster than expected. Encouraging to see the leverage in the model. But how much of an improvement would you attribute to just product gross margin improvement here versus higher sales productivity that you expect in the second half clearly performing better? Just trying to understand what's driving that?\nMichael Scarpelli: Yes. Well, it's - the gross profit is driving part of that, the revenue outperformance and also improved gross margins. As we said, we improved 150 basis points. We're really looking more to keep our sales productivity flat and improve that. Because if it's growing too fast, it means we're not adding reps at a fast enough pace out there. And it's really partly because of COVID with the return to office. We're not traveling. We saw some uptick in and our hiring was more back-end loaded. And as most of you know, we tend to be very cost conscious when we spend money on anything. And I don't think there's a lot of waste in our numbers.\nBrent Bracelin: So a lot of that is just the flow-through on the product side, and then it sounds like you are still hiring aggressively. Helpful color. Thank you.\nMichael Scarpelli: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gray Powell from BTIG. Your line is open.\nGray Powell: Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the strong results. So yes, maybe a high-level question on my side. I guess what do you see is the bigger driver of your business today? Is it the replacement of legacy data warehouse architectures? Or is it more net new from modern companies like Instacart and Coinbase that start out and build businesses on top of Snowflake?\nFrank Slootman: This is Frank. It's actually an important question to ask because we have very high net revenue retention rates and people are often wondering, where's that coming from because that's typically not seen. The reason is a lot of what Snowflake does is what we call enabling the demand. In other words, we're not creating it, we're allowing it to happen. So, there's a lot of latent bottled-up, pent-up demand that has literally grown over literally decades where people have - because of fixed capacity limits on storage, on computational or contractual limitations, they have not been able to do what the technology is now capable of doing. So just unlocking that puzzle and allowing workloads to be provisioned, allow unlimited number of concurrent workloads, let jobs run every night as opposed to once a month, if you're lucky. That is really the explosion, the enablement of demand that was already there is really the big, big driver behind Snowflake. Now there are others. I mean, there's brand-new use cases that are exploding in several of these verticals that are driving a lot of demand as well. This is a very dynamic marketplace. This is not - okay, we have an existing workload, we're going to move it to the cloud and call it a day. That is not the nature of this business. This is a very fluid dynamic process where people are doing brand-new innovative things. The great thing about the public cloud combined with Snowflake is that technology is no longer standing in the way. What is only standing in the way now is your imagination and your budget. Those are not minor things, by the way, but that's a hell a lot better than having a fixed limitation that we historically have had to live with.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPatrick Colville: Thank you very much for taking my question. Can I just ask about this vertical strategy that you referenced at the beginning of the call, Frank. I mean, how much of the vertical strategy is product specificity versus kind of go-to-market and partnerships?\nFrank Slootman: It's not product. We only have one product and the product is not vertical as it's a horizontal product. It's an infrastructure platform. So, this is really about use cases. It's how you apply the technology to industry-specific challenges and problems. So you can, as you said, it very much has to do with, okay, what are specific institutions doing in specific industries with Snowflake and how can other entities in that industry and sub-industry take advantage of those learnings? There's a lot of talk going on inside these verticals between entities about, hey, what are the opportunities to apply these technologies to problems that we're all living with? So that's why verticalization is so important because we can really accelerate our business when these use cases and these opportunities are becoming more broadly shared.\nPatrick Colville: Yes That's helpful. And can I keep going on the product side, actually? And just talking about Snowpark, again, you referenced that in your prepared remarks. I mean even though we're still kind of early in that product cycle, just help me understand the indicators that you're seeing that drive confidence that developers embrace Snowpark?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes, Christian here. We look at a number of adoption metrics. All of them are following our most successful launches relative to other previews we've done. We have talked to different customers that have been early adopters of the technology and the feedback is overwhelmingly positive. And as Frank mentioned in his remarks, we have over 50 partners that have signed up to drive solutions in Snowpark. And they also have overwhelmingly positive feedback, but that will also provide leverage to the adoption. So, we're highly confident.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking the question. This is [indiscernible] for Keith. I have another question for Christian. It sort of relates to Snowflake and maybe the application market, which is a $300 billion market today. As customers are sort of centralizing more and more of your data onto Snowflake, what are the potential opportunities in terms of applications, development of applications on top of Snowflake? Maybe it's a next-generation CRM or a next-generation financial application, given that you're centralizing that data, what do you think that Snowflake's role could be when it comes to applications? Is that something more that partners would sort of build on top of? Or could we see Snowflake have some ambitions on the application side of that?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes, Christian here. It's a great question. And really something that is an important priority for us. We shared some of this vision at our Investor Day. One of the biggest challenges that application developers face today is the notion of data governance where they need to get customers to trust them and share the data with them. What we are enabling is bringing those applications to operate within the governance and security perimeter of Snowflake. And we see interest from applications across horizontals and verticals wanting to build on top of Snowflake and running closer to the data without creating copies or silos.\nFrank Slootman: Yes, one follow-up. This is Frank. One of the things that we talk about when we talk about the Data Cloud is that it's a completely comprehensive hemisphere for application developers. And I referenced this in the prepared remarks. But what that means is we have a data cloud that has number one live data. Number two, it has full-blown infrastructure, obviously, that can scale unlimited as a function of our public cloud relationships. We have, through Snowpark, a complete application development infrastructure on top of that cloud. Then we have a marketplace that allows people to find, to discover, to explore, to try out applications. And then you layer monetization on top of that, you have basically an environment where developers can build cloud applications that the world has never seen before. And we sometimes compare this to what happened on mobile development, which obviously was a huge world. The mobile developers have to set up separate environments for the iPhone and for Android. Here, you literally have one place and you'll be able to target multiple runtime platforms in terms of AWS and Azure, GCP and so on. So that's really what the Data Cloud - when it's fully built out, and all its capabilities, what it will be. And so I think your question about software developers is strategically very important to Snowflake.\nUnidentified Analyst: You can say, I'm not involved. As a follow-up going into sort of Mike's commentary around the expansion opportunity within these larger customers, I know it's early in terms of like the data marketplace. But is there any sort of examples that you can cite in terms of customers standing up new revenue-generating businesses, whether it's data stores or data marketplace, monetizing that business and how that revenue that you're getting compares to their annual Snowflake spend? Is that a multiple of 2, 5, 10? Any sort of indicator from some of these early cohorts that are monetizing, saving up new businesses on Snowflake?\nFrank Slootman: Yes. I think we - this is Frank. We have seen some of our data partners certainly in the financial verticals having, in a very short period of time, very substantial expansion of their business. We're literally a channel for them to reach demand that they couldn't through traditional challenges. I can't really bring any more sort of comparisons and metrics to it. It's probably something that we'll try to do at a future point in time. But there is no doubt that, as I said during the prepared remarks, we have tremendous growth in the data listings that are coming on to the marketplace. And by the way, the reason that they're coming is because they're viewing Snowflake increasingly as a place where they can sell data. And the network effect starts to be induced and more data begets more data, right, because it becomes a very rich environment after a while. So, we're very positive with this quarter with the growth in listings, the growth in data and so on. And that's really how we track our progress in terms of the Data Cloud and the data networking relationships that make up that Data Cloud.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kamil Mielczarek of William Blair. Your line is open.\nKamil Mielczarek: Congrats on a strong quarter. And thank you for taking my questions. I believe you mentioned in your prepared remarks that tech and financial services were large drivers of RPO strength. And at your user conference, you called out media, entertainment as your largest vertical. So it's great to see the broad growth. As you look out across - as you look across the six end markets that you've structured your sales force around, are there any industries that particularly stand out as drivers of strength over the next one to two years, especially as the economy opens up? And where do you see the risks of deceleration, particularly as you think about your guidance?\nFrank Slootman: Well, this is Frank. You're correct, both media, entertainment, that area is approximately the same order of magnitude of financial services or are both the drivers of our business. I really don't see any deceleration risk. I'm just - we're just waiting for industries that were heavily affected by the pandemic to come online. Obviously, hospitality, aviation, all the places that have suffered disproportionately to start normalizing and will become, I guess, more daring in terms of their exploits with us. So, I see that as upside. But one of the great things about the type of business that we're in, it's very secular in the sense that it's really not driven by too many macro factors. I mean, this is something that people are going to do because some of them are just doing it faster than others.\nKamil Mielczarek: Yes. Makes sense. And just as a quick follow-up. Can you talk about any changes you've seen on the competitor front? Are you seeing any private companies more often and among your large public competitors? Are you seeing any impact from the changes they're making to their platforms?\nFrank Slootman: Not really. The competitive environment has been speculated upon quite a bit in recent days and weeks. But from our perspective, things are the same. Now obviously, when you become a much bigger company as we have been, here the intensity starts to pick up because you\u2019re just in more places, you're contesting in more places and so on. But fundamentally, the dynamic is as we have characterized it previously. So, there's really nothing terribly noteworthy in this area.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. I apologize for asking the question. But with a lot of the legacy players you have, okay, how is customer behavior changing now as the pandemic is getting better? We have like recovery talks and stuff like that. And new growth has been so strong over the last few quarters or throughout the whole life. But do you see any change in customer behavior in terms of contract size, contract lengths and stuff like that coming through that we should think about that you might not think about it. And then I had one follow-up.\nMichael Scarpelli: I don\u2019t see any real change in contract duration. Still, the majority of our customers start with a one-year contract. And then on the renewal - they do a multi-year contract. We did see our ACV pickup, but in terms of deal size, it's actually remained pretty consistent there. I will say there are some new customers we're in discussions with that are willing to do bigger deals, first year deal that are one-year deals with them. But I don't think that's going to change the ramp time to any of these customers. Historically, they just take nine months to 12 months to really ramp a large customer.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then one follow-up more for Frank maybe. If you think about, initially, the discussion was like Snowflake as a chart leader competitor, but what we see now more and more is like you as a data platform, more guys working with you, how do you see that mix evolving? How customers see you versus like some of the old traditional players in the future? It almost feels like you're moving way beyond that, and it's kind of the long discussion that we are having here. Thank you. And congrats from me as well.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. It's not entirely the wrong discussion to have. I mean, both these dynamics are playing out at the same time. There's tons of discussion going on in terms of legacy replacements and you mentioned Teradata. And the reality of the Teradata world is, it's not that easy to pick up that workload and move it as it costs a lot of money. And I think Teradata has done a good job making it bloody hard to move off their platform, kudos to them. But we're still up 30% year-on-year in terms of Teradata replacements. So, that will play itself out over time. It's going to happen. It's just - it's going to grow faster. It is going to happen. It's not going to stay. But you are also correct that those are traditional data warehousing workloads. And obviously, we're the king of doing that sort of thing. But as I commented earlier, we're busting out in all these verticals and all these new use cases that are going way beyond data warehousing. The data cloud is the evolution of the data warehouse. That is the way to think about it, right? It is an incredibly enhanced vision of what data warehousing was, right? So that's where people want to go. They don't want to replicate the data warehousing legacy in the cloud. That is a missed opportunity. And that's why there's so much new energy and new dynamics going on because of what is now possible that wasn't before.\nMichael Scarpelli: I'll also add, Raimo, too. It's not just Teradata, there's piles of Hadoop on-prem Cloudera that we are doing. And we're in discussions with many customers who still have multiple years left on those contracts, but they're all in discussions to move to Snowflake. So they take number of years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.\nDavid Hynes: Great set of numbers here. Mike, the net revenue expansion metrics stand out and continue to impress. I'm just curious, as the base ages, are there any consistent signals that this expansion starts to plateau or normalize either at a certain time period or spend threshold? I don't know if there's cohort data that you can share. I'm just trying to think about how this plays out longer term as the business matures.\nMichael Scarpelli: Obviously, longer term, it will come down as our customer base becomes larger. I think we've only been selling product for, what, five years now, six years? And remember, this is going back two years looking at it. I don't see any real slowdown in the near-term future, but definitely, over time, that number will come down.\nDavid Hynes: Okay. And then, Frank, one for you. As you continue to introduce new solutions, features, functionality, will they always be aimed at driving incremental consumption? Or do you see Snowflake ever introducing additional non-consumption-based SKUs that could add different layers to the revenue model?\nFrank Slootman: Well, we obviously are very focused. We look at the world through a lens of consumption. That is true. That's how we seek alignment. But one area that comes to mind that is not consumption-based is through the monetization models that we are developing for data and data applications. So that will also drive consumption, where we will also have a transactional component that will be a completely different business than non-consumption.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen. Your line is open.\nDerrick Wood: Thanks for taking my questions. Frank, I wanted to start a couple of questions in verticals. Obviously, you guys highlighted financial services. And I'm just curious if you're seeing a trend of new use cases that - is it customer 360? Is it trading? Is it fraud detection, cybersecurity? Anything you'd highlight as trending upwards? And then on a different vertical of retail, are you having any early traction kind of moving beyond analytics into operational automation like inventory management, supplier management things that you can automate from an operational standpoint?\nFrank Slootman: Well, obviously, we have large customers against a card who obviously have revolutionized retail. And obviously, they have a very important relationships with the large retailers all over the place. The use of Snowflake there affords them a whole kinds of new opportunities for insights and for optimization, so retail is hot. It's really the combination of retail worth the CPGs, the consumer packaged goods providers, the amount of data that is moving back and forth between these entities and the insights that can now be derived and then how much faster these insights are being derived. So in retail, certainly, the type of business that has to come a long way in terms of sophistication used to be - that is very difficult for them to have accurate inventory levels and really know where to restock and how to restock. And things like Instacart have really helped because they run catalogs across all these stores. They know exactly what's there, what's not there, and that's sort of the new value that's brought in terms of data to these verticals. I can go on and on about one vertical after another in terms of what's going on there. I mean, I remember having a conversation with a Chief Science Officer of a big pharma and they were saying that they view the biggest impact in the world of life sciences in terms of people's longevity and quality of life will come from data science and will not come from life science, which are really enormous statements to come out of life sciences companies that they think that the enrichment of data is going to create insight in terms of the effectiveness of treatments and therapies and protocols and so on that are going to have an enormous effect. So that's why you see data becoming extremely important to all these different verticals because of the impact that it's going to happen what these people do for a living.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks. And one for Mike, obviously, impressive to see that 169% net revenue retention. You had said at least 60 - 160% this year. You're kind of pushing close to 170%. Are you - should we still be thinking about at least 160%? And what do you see as the biggest drivers that could generate upside to your expectations?\nMichael Scarpelli: I don't think it's going to go up. I think we're going to continue to be above 160% for the balance of the year, what I said last quarter. And our large customers just continue to increase their consumption. When I look at the forecast for this quarter, our largest customers are continuing to consume at a very rapid pace.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Church from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nDan Church: This is Dan Church on for Kash Rangan. Thanks for taking the question. I'm piggying back on that net expansion rate, obviously 169% really healthy. When you look at your large customers, how do you think about the runway that you have from a share of wallet perspective? And how big Snowflake ultimately become in terms of a line item and how sustainable that 160% number is? And then when you look at your $1 million customers, can you give us a sense of how much of that is Fortune 500 versus customers that may fall below that threshold?\nFrank Slootman: So let me go first, Mike. You can go second on the second part of the question. It is really hard to predict where the ship is going to hit to beat because it is so dynamic, there is so much latent pent-up demand, there's so much opportunity. So it's really not that helpful to look at historical spend and try to extrapolate that into the future - foretell exactly - that's going to be. No, we can't. We're just going to follow it to where it leads and we're going to enable it to the maximum extent but I can't put a second to ground and say, this is what it will be.\nMichael Scarpelli: Yes, on your question the Fortune 500, and I just want to remind people Fortune 500 is very much a U.S. centric term. And the Fortune 500 account for roughly 25% of our million dollar plus customers. We have a number of Global 2000 we started looking at Global 2000. I think we now have 462 of the Global 2000 mostly reporting on that next year. But clearly, large customers are what are driving those that $1 million is a lot that are Fortune 500s that are large customers, and we think that will continue to be the case. Yes, the Fortune 500s have big wallets and those will be some of our largest customers and we think that will continue to be the case. In terms of your net revenue retention, I'm not going to guide long term. It's hard to do that. I'm just going to say reiterate again what I said to Derrick is we will stay above 160 for this year. And I do expect longer term as our customer base gets bigger and bigger and more mature, that number will come down, but I still think it will be well above 130, 140 for a very long time.\nDan Church: That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. I mean we talked about the storage compression improvements last quarter and some of the impact on gross margins as revenue mix shifts more towards compute and then we layer on kind of the opportunity of an data sharing to drive incremental compute per unit of storage. How you see that impacting gross margins over the next, let's say 12 to 24 months?\nMichael Scarpelli: Well, we saw it right now, and I'm not expecting a big increase in - as a reminder, we do new storage compression technology over two years. We just rolled that went out last quarter. Storage is running just under 10% of our total revenue. And so clearly compute is what\u2019s driving the margin now. And we think with data sharing will be a higher percentage of compute going forward. I don't expect it to see much improvement on the storage side. The biggest driver though on gross margin is as we move into larger customers that are buying enterprise and business-critical. That is more software rich that drives the gross margin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Joe on for Pat. Great sort of strength in the APAC, in the Asia-Pacific region. A [indiscernible] for your cloud in the region [indiscernible] what's the thought process there? Any color would be great. Thank you.\nMichael Scarpelli: Yes, let me, just say, first off, we have made a decision as a company that we need to move into China, that's because China is now into the world economy is not a separate market, and our largest customers are demanding and sustain that would be there and we\u2019re already in the middle of figuring out how to be there and we are reevaluating all those options. Whether we are in one flavor of the cloud or another depends a whole lot on what type of a dynamic growth we\u2019re anticipating. We\u2019ve learned a whole bunch from being with Amazon, being with Microsoft and being with Google, and we're certainly going to take those learnings into that market as well. Christian do you have anything do you want to add to that.\nChristian Kleinerman: I would add that, we like meeting customers where they are, and they guide very much our deployment regional, as well as cloud deployments. As Frank said yes, we want to grow in China and he is working with our customers that we determine how we do.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Scarpelli",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. We saw continued strength across the board in Q2 with great sales execution and operational efficiencies, setting us up for a strong back half of the year. Our Q2 product revenues were $255 million, representing 103% year-over-year growth. Consumption outperformance was led by our financial services customers, with continued strength from our technology and healthcare verticals. Our rapid growth is driven by our existing customer base. The expansion of our net revenue retention rate to 169% is indicative of the power of our product over time, as well as our sales team driving long-term business outcomes. Q2 was an impressive quarter of sales execution. Remaining performance obligations grew to $1.529 billion, with net new bookings led by the technology and financial services verticals. We are still maturing sales organization to sell multi-year contracts, and the timing of the largest multi-year deals will be lumpy. As a reminder, in Q2 last year, we sold our largest multi-year contract ever, a three-year $100 million deal. While the multi-year component of new booking sets up a difficult comparison, we saw a net - we saw new annualized contract value accelerate compared to the year ago period. This is why RPO and revenue must be evaluated together in a consumption-based business model. Of the $1.5 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 56% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, representing approximately $87 million increase quarter-over-quarter. We remain focused on penetrating the largest enterprises globally as we believe these organizations provide the largest opportunity for account expansion. In Q2, the number of customers with greater than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue increased to 116, up from 104 last quarter. The second quarter was a breakout quarter for us in terms of profitability and efficiency. On a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 73.6%, up 140 basis points from last quarter. Increased price per credit related to higher price addition consumption and higher-than-expected compute as a percent of revenue from improved storage compression mentioned last quarter drove the outperformance. We have confidence in our ability to show leverage over time, but we view this significant quarter-over-quarter increase as one-time in nature. Operating margin was negative 8%, benefiting from revenue outperformance. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 1%, positively impacted by strong linearity in bookings and operating margin outperformance. Going forward, we believe we will remain adjusted free cash flow positive. As a reminder, adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of net cash paid or received on both employee and employer payroll taxes related items on employee stock transactions. This quarter, we saw a $15 million impact from those items. We maintained a strong cash position with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Now let's turn to our guidance and outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $280 million and $285 million, representing year-over-year growth between 89% and 92%. Turning to margins. We expect, on a non-GAAP basis, negative 7% operating margin, and we expect 303 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full-year fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $1.06 billion and $1.07 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 91% and 93%. Turning to profitability for the full year. We expect, on a non-GAAP basis, 73% product gross margins, negative 9% operating margin and 7% adjusted free cash flow margin. And we expect 300 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our outlook assumes that we will still add more than 1,200 net new employees during the fiscal year. With respect to COVID, our forecast now assumes that we will most likely continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future, and we have paused most travel with a slight uptick of return to office expenses in the fourth quarter. While we anticipate an eventual return to the office, we do not have a specific time line for that goal. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. As a reminder, Christian Kleinerman, our SVP of Product, will be joining us for Q&A. I'm not really giving that. It's been running in the low to mid-50s. And as I said, we expect 56% based on what we're seeing today. That could change. And it really changes based upon how many multi-year deals we do because, obviously, when the total RPO grows because of multi-year, that percentage could come down, but what we're seeing now is 56% we're estimating. I would say less than 1% has come from new customers we landed in the quarter. And for the full year, less than 10% will be for customers we land in the year. As a reminder, when we land these customers, it takes nine months to 12 months before they really start consuming at a rate. So, what's really driving the revenue this year are all of the customers we landed - those large customers we landed last year. And I want to stress too, it's not just those large - we have a lot of small customers that drive a lot of revenue too. It's just - the point is those large customers, they have a lot of growth potential within them still today. Yes. So, it's been a couple of ways. It's done through our professional service people, and we probably do, I think, less than 10% of them out there. But we have a whole alliances program that's focused on all the global GSIs and the regional partners. And I think the number of those partners, including GSIs, is up 3x from what it was last year. And you can see one of the things on our professional service line, a big chunk of that is training. And we are spending a lot of time training partners, so their people can get certified doing a lot of training the trainers, so they can add more resources that are Snowflake certified to do these migrations and implementations. Yes. Well, it's - the gross profit is driving part of that, the revenue outperformance and also improved gross margins. As we said, we improved 150 basis points. We're really looking more to keep our sales productivity flat and improve that. Because if it's growing too fast, it means we're not adding reps at a fast enough pace out there. And it's really partly because of COVID with the return to office. We're not traveling. We saw some uptick in and our hiring was more back-end loaded. And as most of you know, we tend to be very cost conscious when we spend money on anything. And I don't think there's a lot of waste in our numbers. Sure. I don't see any real change in contract duration. Still, the majority of our customers start with a one-year contract. And then on the renewal - they do a multi-year contract. We did see our ACV pickup, but in terms of deal size, it's actually remained pretty consistent there. I will say there are some new customers we're in discussions with that are willing to do bigger deals, first year deal that are one-year deals with them. But I don't think that's going to change the ramp time to any of these customers. Historically, they just take nine months to 12 months to really ramp a large customer. I'll also add, Raimo, too. It's not just Teradata, there's piles of Hadoop on-prem Cloudera that we are doing. And we're in discussions with many customers who still have multiple years left on those contracts, but they're all in discussions to move to Snowflake. So they take number of years. Obviously, longer term, it will come down as our customer base becomes larger. I think we've only been selling product for, what, five years now, six years? And remember, this is going back two years looking at it. I don't see any real slowdown in the near-term future, but definitely, over time, that number will come down. I don't think it's going to go up. I think we're going to continue to be above 160% for the balance of the year, what I said last quarter. And our large customers just continue to increase their consumption. When I look at the forecast for this quarter, our largest customers are continuing to consume at a very rapid pace. Yes, on your question the Fortune 500, and I just want to remind people Fortune 500 is very much a U.S. centric term. And the Fortune 500 account for roughly 25% of our million dollar plus customers. We have a number of Global 2000 we started looking at Global 2000. I think we now have 462 of the Global 2000 mostly reporting on that next year. But clearly, large customers are what are driving those that $1 million is a lot that are Fortune 500s that are large customers, and we think that will continue to be the case. Yes, the Fortune 500s have big wallets and those will be some of our largest customers and we think that will continue to be the case. In terms of your net revenue retention, I'm not going to guide long term. It's hard to do that. I'm just going to say reiterate again what I said to Derrick is we will stay above 160 for this year. And I do expect longer term as our customer base gets bigger and bigger and more mature, that number will come down, but I still think it will be well above 130, 140 for a very long time. Well, we saw it right now, and I'm not expecting a big increase in - as a reminder, we do new storage compression technology over two years. We just rolled that went out last quarter. Storage is running just under 10% of our total revenue. And so clearly compute is what's driving the margin now. And we think with data sharing will be a higher percentage of compute going forward. I don't expect it to see much improvement on the storage side. The biggest driver though on gross margin is as we move into larger customers that are buying enterprise and business-critical. That is more software rich that drives the gross margin. Yes, let me, just say, first off, we have made a decision as a company that we need to move into China, that's because China is now into the world economy is not a separate market, and our largest customers are demanding and sustain that would be there and we're already in the middle of figuring out how to be there and we are reevaluating all those options. Whether we are in one flavor of the cloud or another depends a whole lot on what type of a dynamic growth we're anticipating. We've learned a whole bunch from being with Amazon, being with Microsoft and being with Google, and we're certainly going to take those learnings into that market as well. Christian do you have anything do you want to add to that."

            "name": "Christian Kleinerman",
            "content": "Yes, certainly. Christian here. I think it's the breadth of the platform that we are presenting to our customers, not only performance advantages relative to alternatives, but the economic benefits that our performance represents. We hear that consistently and that has driven migration from a variety of platforms. Yes, Christian here. We look at a number of adoption metrics. All of them are following our most successful launches relative to other previews we've done. We have talked to different customers that have been early adopters of the technology and the feedback is overwhelmingly positive. And as Frank mentioned in his remarks, we have over 50 partners that have signed up to drive solutions in Snowpark. And they also have overwhelmingly positive feedback, but that will also provide leverage to the adoption. So, we're highly confident. Yes, Christian here. It's a great question. And really something that is an important priority for us. We shared some of this vision at our Investor Day. One of the biggest challenges that application developers face today is the notion of data governance where they need to get customers to trust them and share the data with them. What we are enabling is bringing those applications to operate within the governance and security perimeter of Snowflake. And we see interest from applications across horizontals and verticals wanting to build on top of Snowflake and running closer to the data without creating copies or silos. I would add that, we like meeting customers where they are, and they guide very much our deployment regional, as well as cloud deployments. As Frank said yes, we want to grow in China and he is working with our customers that we determine how we do."

            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks, Jimmy. Good afternoon, everybody. We saw continued momentum in Q2 with 103% year-on-year growth to $255 million in product revenues, reflecting strength in Snowflake consumption. Remaining performance obligations grew to $1.5 billion indicating strength in sales. For the first half of fiscal '22, total revenues were $501 million, up 107% year-on-year. As the net revenue retention rate reached 169%, we also saw non-GAAP product gross margin and operating margin efficiency improved to 73.6% from negative 8% respectively. Adjusted free cash flow was positive for the third quarter in a row. As we approached the $1 billion mark in annual revenues, we continue to add customers at a robust pace adding 458 net new customers, up from 397 in Q2 of last year. With a focus on the largest organizations or Fortune 500 count totaled 212, increasing by 18 in the quarter. We are addressing the largest enterprises globally with a vertical industry approach. We see these investments yield strong results. In Q2, financial services customer product revenue grew more than 100% year-on-year, representing the largest contribution, while healthcare customer product revenue grew nearly 200%. We have engaged in targeted industry events for these verticals and we'll continue to go-to market with tailored business outcomes. We are pleased with our geographical expansion outside of the United States for product revenue from EMEA and Asia Pacific, outstripping the company's growth as a whole, growing 185% and 170% year-on-year, respectively. One of our largest new customer signed in the quarter came from Asia Pacific. During Q2, we had key enterprise wins, including AllianceBernstein, Constellation Brands, and Lithia Motors.  Following milestones, we think are worthy of note.  In Q2, we announced public preview availability in all AWS regions of Snowpark, our new developer experience. Snowpark enables developers to work in their preferred programming language in formats, including Java and Scala. Snowpark is designed to make building complex data pipelines and applications easy, and allow developers to interact with Snowflake directly without having to extract data, maximizing governance. The Snowflake accelerated program has over 50 partners enrolled to bring their capabilities and innovations across data science, data engineering, and security to Snowpark. In the future, Snowpark will add support for pipeline and expand to Azure and Google Cloud regions. Python is the most widely used programming language for machine learning and data science generally. We also launched Powered by Snowflake in June to help companies build, operate, and grow applications in the Data Cloud. Powered by Snowflake is designed to accelerate delivery of differentiated applications on Snowflake by supporting developers across all stages of the application journey in Snowflake's Data Cloud. Today, there are over 80 Powered By partners, including founding members, BlackRock, Adobe, Lacework, Observe, and OppLoans. Increasingly, application providers are enabling their apps to operate directly against their customer Snowflake accounts, meaning no data needs to be copied or replicated, simplifying data governance while accelerating the network effect of the Data Cloud. We also continued to deliver new capabilities to strengthen data governance for our customers. During the quarter, we made row access policies generally available. Data governance features are typically the broadest and fastest adopted feature across our customer base. Snowflake's increasing focus on vertical industries is leading to more deeper discussions with customers globally. Snowflake team is organized around the following core verticals. They are financial services, healthcare and life sciences, retail and CPG, advertising, media and entertainment, technology, public sector, education and manufacturing. This vertical industry focus will continue to intensify and expand over time. One example of our vertical approach is the advertising industry, which is facing new regulations and increasing pressure to strengthen consumer privacy. Advertisers want to compete in a market dominated by the walled gardens. The Snowflake Data Cloud is empowering large media companies, technology providers, and marketers to collaborate with their data assets across the ecosystem. Snowflake's data clean room solutions can enable companies to share and join data without copying or moving their data assets. Snowflake's Data Cloud powers these data clean rooms with transparency and privacy controls for customers like Disney and NBCUniversal. Each customer is creating their own data network within the Snowflake Data Cloud for their advertising businesses. Snowflake continues to deliver performance and optimization improvements throughout the platform, from improving storage efficiencies, lower ingestion latencies to faster query performance across different workloads. Performance improvements bring not only timelier insights, but improve the economics of our platform for our customers. Finally, Data Cloud adoption is growing rapidly. The Data Cloud is the sum of all data networking relationships that are active at any point in time. We track these data relationships through what we call edges. We added over 450 customers in the quarter and continue to expand the number of customers with stable edges. At the end of the quarter, 16% of our customers had stabilized edges in place with external Snowflake accounts compared to 15% last quarter. The total number of these stable edges grew more than 20% quarter over quarter. This growth is fueled by the content on our marketplace, which saw listings grow 32% quarter-over-quarter. The Data Cloud enables our customers to enrich their data, gain more effective analytical insight, and do so faster and more cost effectively. Strategically, Snowflake is emerging as a highly secure, compliant, global and efficient data network in the infrastructure across the major public cloud domains. The combination of world-class data workload execution with cloud application development, cross-cloud operations, data and data application marketplaces as well as planned monetization is what makes Snowflake stand out. During the quarter, we hosted our Annual Snowflake Summit to share our Data Cloud strategy, platform optimizations, feature enhancements and vertical industry use cases. Over 60,000 folks registered for the three-day event. We had four industry executive sessions and more than 60 customer sessions. Snowflake was launched in preview with over 50 partners supporting the Snowpark Accelerated program. And we announced OverlayAnalytics as the winner of the first Snowflake Startup Challenge. In Q3, we will be hosting events, including the Snowflake Financial Services Data Summit across the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific, where we'll be sharing more of how Snowflake is connecting the entire financial services ecosystem. Snowflake is a sponsor at Ad Week, where we will discuss our enhanced advertising media and entertainment offerings. And finally, Snowflake is holding our BUILD event for technical executives, including CTOs, VPs of engineering, data scientists, data engineers, and application developers. In closing, our results demonstrate high-quality durable growth, coupled with improving efficiency and we're looking forward to executing the second half of the year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. I don't have an exact authoritative number to report back to you. But I can tell you that I'm involved in those conversations on a daily basis. We lead with a value proposition literally in every conversation. We're betting 1,000 when we go down the Data Cloud path. So, we're super excited by the way this is resonating with our future customers. Now that said, the way our market has historically worked, people have had a workload attitude and mentality to the world in terms of moving to the cloud. So sometimes the data cloud is viewed as something that is sort of Phase 2 or Phase 3. People are first preoccupied with moving data to the cloud, then moving workloads to the cloud and then having sort of pulling up and having a look at what's next. We're working very hard to make sure that we look at the Data Cloud right from the beginning. And the real reason is what you don't want to do, and this is what we tell every single customer that we meet with is to recreate the silos of the past in the cloud because they'll find the exact same set of challenges that they have today. So, the Data Cloud conversation has to happen upfront to prevent people from re-siloing their data and really selling themselves short on the potential of data sciences, machine learning, and all the advanced analytics capabilities that are coming down the pike. On a geo basis, I think we're sort of experiencing traditional patterns in enterprise software adoptions, U.S. leading, EMEA following, and after that Asia-Pacific. We are actually really encouraged by the uptick in EMEA. We certainly have work to do coming into the company in terms of how we were approaching that marketplace. It's coming around really well, very pleased in what's going on in Asia Pacific as well. I mean we're really big on making sure that all our products, all our regions, all our channels are showing up every single quarter. And that's really a key focus when you're driving high growth the way we have been. So, everybody is contributing and that's - if there is a secret sauce, that's part of it. Yes. Actually, a great question because, ironically, this wasn't true in the previous company that you referenced. Public sector is actually the slowest market for Snowflake to come along in Asia Pacific traditionally, especially Japan tend to be the slow adopters. They're actually coming around much faster than public sector is actually slower. And one of the reasons is cloud adoption in the federal government is really hard because of the standards that they have for companies like ours, and we can go on-prem. It's something that we did do at ServiceNow, as you recall. We are now getting close to approaching the requirements for broadly being able to contest federal business. We believe that federal business can become 15% of our total number. So, there is an enormous opportunity pending for us there, where we have not really effectively addressed it up to this point, but we are super confident that we are going to. There is a lot of tremendous demand there. And it's very much a procedural set of requirements that we have to grind through and it's not easy to do. So once it's there, it will also really form quite a moat or a barrier, if you will, around that type of cloud business. This is Frank. It's actually an important question to ask because we have very high net revenue retention rates and people are often wondering, where's that coming from because that's typically not seen. The reason is a lot of what Snowflake does is what we call enabling the demand. In other words, we're not creating it, we're allowing it to happen. So, there's a lot of latent bottled-up, pent-up demand that has literally grown over literally decades where people have - because of fixed capacity limits on storage, on computational or contractual limitations, they have not been able to do what the technology is now capable of doing. So just unlocking that puzzle and allowing workloads to be provisioned, allow unlimited number of concurrent workloads, let jobs run every night as opposed to once a month, if you're lucky. That is really the explosion, the enablement of demand that was already there is really the big, big driver behind Snowflake. Now there are others. I mean, there's brand-new use cases that are exploding in several of these verticals that are driving a lot of demand as well. This is a very dynamic marketplace. This is not - okay, we have an existing workload, we're going to move it to the cloud and call it a day. That is not the nature of this business. This is a very fluid dynamic process where people are doing brand-new innovative things. The great thing about the public cloud combined with Snowflake is that technology is no longer standing in the way. What is only standing in the way now is your imagination and your budget. Those are not minor things, by the way, but that's a hell a lot better than having a fixed limitation that we historically have had to live with. It's not product. We only have one product and the product is not vertical as it's a horizontal product. It's an infrastructure platform. So, this is really about use cases. It's how you apply the technology to industry-specific challenges and problems. So you can, as you said, it very much has to do with, okay, what are specific institutions doing in specific industries with Snowflake and how can other entities in that industry and sub-industry take advantage of those learnings? There's a lot of talk going on inside these verticals between entities about, hey, what are the opportunities to apply these technologies to problems that we're all living with? So that's why verticalization is so important because we can really accelerate our business when these use cases and these opportunities are becoming more broadly shared. Yes, one follow-up. This is Frank. One of the things that we talk about when we talk about the Data Cloud is that it's a completely comprehensive hemisphere for application developers. And I referenced this in the prepared remarks. But what that means is we have a data cloud that has number one live data. Number two, it has full-blown infrastructure, obviously, that can scale unlimited as a function of our public cloud relationships. We have, through Snowpark, a complete application development infrastructure on top of that cloud. Then we have a marketplace that allows people to find, to discover, to explore, to try out applications. And then you layer monetization on top of that, you have basically an environment where developers can build cloud applications that the world has never seen before. And we sometimes compare this to what happened on mobile development, which obviously was a huge world. The mobile developers have to set up separate environments for the iPhone and for Android. Here, you literally have one place and you'll be able to target multiple runtime platforms in terms of AWS and Azure, GCP and so on. So that's really what the Data Cloud - when it's fully built out, and all its capabilities, what it will be. And so I think your question about software developers is strategically very important to Snowflake. Yes. I think we - this is Frank. We have seen some of our data partners certainly in the financial verticals having, in a very short period of time, very substantial expansion of their business. We're literally a channel for them to reach demand that they couldn't through traditional challenges. I can't really bring any more sort of comparisons and metrics to it. It's probably something that we'll try to do at a future point in time. But there is no doubt that, as I said during the prepared remarks, we have tremendous growth in the data listings that are coming on to the marketplace. And by the way, the reason that they're coming is because they're viewing Snowflake increasingly as a place where they can sell data. And the network effect starts to be induced and more data begets more data, right, because it becomes a very rich environment after a while. So, we're very positive with this quarter with the growth in listings, the growth in data and so on. And that's really how we track our progress in terms of the Data Cloud and the data networking relationships that make up that Data Cloud. Well, this is Frank. You're correct, both media, entertainment, that area is approximately the same order of magnitude of financial services or are both the drivers of our business. I really don't see any deceleration risk. I'm just - we're just waiting for industries that were heavily affected by the pandemic to come online. Obviously, hospitality, aviation, all the places that have suffered disproportionately to start normalizing and will become, I guess, more daring in terms of their exploits with us. So, I see that as upside. But one of the great things about the type of business that we're in, it's very secular in the sense that it's really not driven by too many macro factors. I mean, this is something that people are going to do because some of them are just doing it faster than others. Not really. The competitive environment has been speculated upon quite a bit in recent days and weeks. But from our perspective, things are the same. Now obviously, when you become a much bigger company as we have been, here the intensity starts to pick up because you're just in more places, you're contesting in more places and so on. But fundamentally, the dynamic is as we have characterized it previously. So, there's really nothing terribly noteworthy in this area. Yes. It's not entirely the wrong discussion to have. I mean, both these dynamics are playing out at the same time. There's tons of discussion going on in terms of legacy replacements and you mentioned Teradata. And the reality of the Teradata world is, it's not that easy to pick up that workload and move it as it costs a lot of money. And I think Teradata has done a good job making it bloody hard to move off their platform, kudos to them. But we're still up 30% year-on-year in terms of Teradata replacements. So, that will play itself out over time. It's going to happen. It's just - it's going to grow faster. It is going to happen. It's not going to stay. But you are also correct that those are traditional data warehousing workloads. And obviously, we're the king of doing that sort of thing. But as I commented earlier, we're busting out in all these verticals and all these new use cases that are going way beyond data warehousing. The data cloud is the evolution of the data warehouse. That is the way to think about it, right? It is an incredibly enhanced vision of what data warehousing was, right? So that's where people want to go. They don't want to replicate the data warehousing legacy in the cloud. That is a missed opportunity. And that's why there's so much new energy and new dynamics going on because of what is now possible that wasn't before. Well, we obviously are very focused. We look at the world through a lens of consumption. That is true. That's how we seek alignment. But one area that comes to mind that is not consumption-based is through the monetization models that we are developing for data and data applications. So that will also drive consumption, where we will also have a transactional component that will be a completely different business than non-consumption. Well, obviously, we have large customers against a card who obviously have revolutionized retail. And obviously, they have a very important relationships with the large retailers all over the place. The use of Snowflake there affords them a whole kinds of new opportunities for insights and for optimization, so retail is hot. It's really the combination of retail worth the CPGs, the consumer packaged goods providers, the amount of data that is moving back and forth between these entities and the insights that can now be derived and then how much faster these insights are being derived. So in retail, certainly, the type of business that has to come a long way in terms of sophistication used to be - that is very difficult for them to have accurate inventory levels and really know where to restock and how to restock. And things like Instacart have really helped because they run catalogs across all these stores. They know exactly what's there, what's not there, and that's sort of the new value that's brought in terms of data to these verticals. I can go on and on about one vertical after another in terms of what's going on there. I mean, I remember having a conversation with a Chief Science Officer of a big pharma and they were saying that they view the biggest impact in the world of life sciences in terms of people's longevity and quality of life will come from data science and will not come from life science, which are really enormous statements to come out of life sciences companies that they think that the enrichment of data is going to create insight in terms of the effectiveness of treatments and therapies and protocols and so on that are going to have an enormous effect. So that's why you see data becoming extremely important to all these different verticals because of the impact that it's going to happen what these people do for a living. So let me go first, Mike. You can go second on the second part of the question. It is really hard to predict where the ship is going to hit to beat because it is so dynamic, there is so much latent pent-up demand, there's so much opportunity. So it's really not that helpful to look at historical spend and try to extrapolate that into the future - foretell exactly - that's going to be. No, we can't. We're just going to follow it to where it leads and we're going to enable it to the maximum extent but I can't put a second to ground and say, this is what it will be."

[Operator Instructions]\n I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Mr. Jimmy Sexton, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Sir, please go ahead. \nJimmy Sexton: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Snowflake's Q1 Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me are Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer.\n During today's call, we will review our financial results for first quarter fiscal 2022 and discuss our guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2022.\n During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, products and features, long-term growth and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2021, that we will file with the SEC. We caution you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations.\n We'd also like to point out that on today's call, we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. To see the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings press release distributed earlier today and our investor presentation, which are posted at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website.\n With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank. \nFrank Slootman: Thanks, Jimmy. Good afternoon, everybody. We reported strong Q1 results with 110% year-on-year growth to $214 million in product revenues, reflecting strength in Snowflake consumption. Remaining performance obligations grew 206% year-on-year to $1.4 billion, indicating strength in sales across the board. While maintaining a net revenue retention rate of 168%, we also generated $23 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter.\n We are expanding our geographical scope in all 3 major theaters. Both EMEA and APJ have breakout bookings quarters. EMEA grew more than 200% and Asia Pacific grew more than 300% year-over-year. At the end of Q1, we had 104 customers with over $1 million in product revenue, an increase from 77 in the previous quarter. During Q1, we had key enterprise wins, including Datadog, Equifax and Walgreens Boots Alliance.\n Our growth trajectory is a function of several factors. First, the modernization from on-premise to cloud computing is changing the landscape. Customers are moving workloads to public clouds to take advantage of unlimited capacity at scale and the utility model with less than paid by the drink. Secondly, through Snowflake's cloud-native software architecture, customers achieve remarkable gains in performance, economy and data governance. Third, customers are now seeking to transform from a world where data informs people to one in which data drives operations directly. Data drives digital transformation. Data is the beating heart of the modern enterprise. And Snowflake is becoming a core infrastructure to the digital economy.\n The data economy has seen some lift from the pandemic dislocation, but these are our long-term secular trends enabled by new technology. Aside from pent-up demand, the possibilities are only limited now by one's imagination and budgets. Part of our growth at scale strategy has been our transition to the Data Cloud. Our original focus of targeting legacy data warehouse workloads is going strong, and that will continue indefinitely. It has been a tried-and-true strategy for Snowflake. Snowflake has now processed more than 1 billion queries in a day, and that number grew more than 100% year-on-year.\n But our view of the future is more ambitious. We seek to build and deploy core infrastructure for the digital economy, and the Data Cloud is exactly that. Data Cloud is an active dynamic hub of thousands of data relationships between Snowflake parties. Many of these relationships are with data providers through the Snowflake Data Marketplace and many others are our key business partners. Data providers like ZoomInfo and Foursquare are using the Data Cloud to unlock more value to their business. Health care organizations are using data insights to improve quality of patient care. Retailers like Albertsons are sharing data with consumer packaged goods companies, and media companies are accelerating advertising revenue with the Snowflake Data Marketplace.\n Historically, data warehouses refreshed through large batch processes on a periodic basis. That's because data was force-fed into them from different sources. Today, the Data Cloud is near-real time with data continuously pulsing through the cloud being analyzed and acted on, lights out and at light speed. There are no limits anymore on how many analytical processes can run concurrently against the same data and how frequently they are run. This has changed people's perceptions of what is possible.\n The Data Cloud is the sum of all data networking relationships that are active at any point in time. We track these relationships through what we call edges. At the end of the quarter, 15% of our rapidly expanding customer base had data edges in place with external Snowflake accounts compared to 10% a year ago. And the number of edges in this period grew 33% quarter-on-quarter. Customer share data for many reasons that are specific to them and their industries, but they all seek to enrich their data, gain more effective analytical insights and do so faster and more cost effectively.\n Snowflake's focus on vertical industries is well underway. We've organized our organization around 6 core verticals. They are financial services; health care and life sciences; retail and consumer packaged goods; advertising, media and entertainment; technology; and public sector. This vertical industry focus will intensify across our sales, marketing, alliances, product and service organizations. As a result, we expect Snowflake to become as visible and a large enterprise IT environment as in the line of business themselves. While the company maintains a geographical backbone in markets around the world, the industry aperture is rapidly coming into focus.\n Our partners are also stepping up to Snowflake, which is a key element of our strategy. Deloitte crossed the $100 million mark on Snowflake Business, which was the fastest ramp ever from a standing start for an alliance. We will host the annual Snowflake Summit June 8 through 10. More than 50,000 attendees are expected, including 60-plus customer sessions with the likes of Adobe, BlackRock, Capital One, Goldman Sachs, Instacart, Kraft Heinz, JetBlue, Morgan Stanley and NBCUniversal. We invite investors to attend, get a better understanding of our Data Cloud strategy and hear the latest news on platform enhancements, optimization, data governance and vertical industry use cases.\n In closing, Q1 was a great start to the fiscal year, and we are much looking forward to the balance of the year.\n With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. \nMichael Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. We saw continued momentum in Q1 with another quarter of great execution at the start of our fiscal year. Our Q1 product revenues were $214 million, representing 110% year-over-year growth. Our remaining performance obligations were $1.4 billion. Media and telecom, technology and financial services customers drove the outperformance, and we saw meaningful growth from our health care customers. Our strong RPO results reflect more multimillion-dollar relationships with particular strength in the telecom and technology sectors. Of the $1.4 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 54% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.\n Growth in our existing customer base continues to propel our results. We added 393 net new customers in Q1, including 3 7-figure new logos. These customers only accounted for 1% of revenues. We are hyper-focused on penetrating the largest enterprises globally as we believe these organizations provide the largest opportunity for account expansion.\n We are already benefiting from our maturing enterprise sales efforts. In Q1, the number of customers with greater than $1 million and trailing 12-month product revenue increased to 104, up from 77 last quarter. When we expand within our largest customers, we typically replace more than 1 solution. In many cases, we replace on-premise and first-generation cloud solutions, and we address new workloads. Snowflake creates use cases that were previously impossible. This is what fuels our 168% net revenue retention rate, and we remain confident that our net revenue retention will stay above 160% for the fiscal year.\n We continue to invest in our international opportunity and believe there is significant runway ahead of us. As Frank mentioned, we are seeing tremendous growth within EMEA and APAC geographies as our sales organization take shape. We believe we are in the early innings of addressing the largest enterprises abroad. First quarter was a record hiring quarter for us. We onboarded 436 net new employees. We continue to target the highest performing employees, prioritizing talent acquisition and product, engineering and enterprise sales groups.\n Turning to margins. On a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 72%, up 600 basis points from last year. Favorable cloud service agreements, growing scales across regions and our enterprise customer success all contribute to steady gross margin improvements. Operating margin was negative 16%, benefiting from revenue outperformance.\n Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 10%, positively impacted by strong collections from Q4 bookings and operating margin outperformance. As a reminder, adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of net cash paid or received on both employee and employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock option transactions. This quarter, we saw a $10 million impact from those items. While we continue to focus on long-term margin expansion and profitability, we do experience free cash flow seasonality. In fiscal '21, Q1 and Q4 were our strongest free cash flow quarters, while Q2 was our weakest. We expect to experience the seasonality in future periods.\n We maintained our strong cash position with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Snowflake Ventures leverages this position to evaluate strategic opportunities with announced investments in ThoughtSpot and DataIQ in the quarter. We continue to provide high-growth companies with capital to engage more with the Data Cloud.\n Now let's turn to our guidance and outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $235 million and $240 million, representing year-over-year growth between 88% and 92%.\n Turning to margins. We expect, on a non-GAAP basis, negative 19% operating margin, and we expect 297 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $1.02 billion and $1.035 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 84% and 87%. This includes an estimated negative $13 million impact from a storage compression improvement we just introduced that benefits our customers. We regularly introduce product and performance enhancements that lower the cost for our customers to run Snowflake, and we believe this will drive more compute within the platform longer term.\n Turning to profitability. We expect, on a non-GAAP basis, 72% product gross margin, negative 17% operating margin and breakeven adjusted free cash flow, and we expect 299 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our outlook still assumes that we will add more than 1,200 net new employees during the fiscal year.\n With respect to COVID, our forecast assumes that we will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future with an increase to travel expenses in the back half of the year. While we anticipate an eventual return to the office, we do not have a specific time line for that goal.\n And lastly, we will host our first virtual Investor Day on June 10 in conjunction with Snowflake Summit. You can register for the event at investors.snowflake.com.\n With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. \nBrent Bracelin: Mike, maybe I'll start with you and a quick follow-up for Frank. Consumption in Q1 here was very strong, $35 million increase in product revenue and another triple-digit product growth quarter. As you look at kind of Q1 consumption trends, any seasonality clearly didn't show up. Was that surprising? Any other surprises just as you looked at individual customer consumption trends that drove the outperformance in Q1? \nMichael Scarpelli: Remember, our revenue is based on actual customer consumption. It's not a ratable recognition. So we did have -- as I mentioned, we did have some outperformance in some specific customers. And part of that is tied to certain projects they're working on. And just because a customer consumes a certain amount one quarter doesn't mean they're going to consume that same amount next quarter if they're not running those same projects. And so we are very happy with the revenue outperformance in Q1. And our guidance reflects where we think we're going to be for the balance of the year. \nBrent Bracelin: Got it. And then, Frank, just following up for you here. If you think about kind of the data sharing opportunity, it clearly seems to be catching on like wildfire, so much so you're starting to see the creation of even new open source projects that are also tied to data sharing. As you think about the 27 net new $1 million-plus customers, do you think data sharing is now contributing to these $1 million-plus customers? Or do you think a bulk of the big spend is still tied to kind of replacement opportunity around data warehousing and the data share drivers still to come? \nFrank Slootman: Well, Brett, the answer is really both. Customers need to walk before they run. So a lot of their initial focus is on workload transitions and so on. But everybody has a very, very keen view in terms of where they want to be, where they're going to be over time. And you're exactly right, data sharing is absolutely essential. It will really enable data sciences in order to create context around data, in order to enrich data to really fully reach that potential. I mean it's taken us some time to really evangelize this whole idea. But as you said, it is resonating very, very aggressively in the marketplace.\n We have a lot going on in our vertical markets that are very specific to those contexts, very specific to the unique circumstances of vertical industries. So we're really excited. We're very well positioned for it. And we have really developed our Data Cloud and our Snowflake Data Marketplace to the point where it's completely operational. And hope we'll see you at our Investor Day because not only we want to talk about it, we're also going to show you a bunch of stuff and see how far we've come in that area. \nBrent Bracelin: Looking forward to it. Thanks, Frank, Mike, for another great quarter here. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. \nKeith Weiss: Excellent. And very nice quarter. Frank, I wanted to continue the discussion on edges and the percentage of customers that you're kind of adding, the edges going from 10% to 15% and the amount of edges up 33% quarter-on-quarter. Is that something we should think about as going to directly impact consumption? Have you seen that the more edges the customer have, the more data consumption is going on within their data warehouse? Or is this more of a construct about stickiness? Once you're getting granted all these partners, you're never going to stop using the Snowflake solution. How should we think about the like the financial impact of this growth in edges? \nFrank Slootman: Well, the answer is both, obviously, it's going to make things incredibly sticky. But for us to designate something as an edge, it has to have a minimal amount of time in terms of durable consumption. So there's very much a consumption dimension to these edges that we track and mods or otherwise, we don't consider it an edge in our world. In other words, they have to be durable and stable because a lot of data relationships are transient. They exist for a period of time. They exist for a project, maybe a trial, whatever it is. But that's not -- that's also a metric that we follow where we really look for, what we'd call, stable or durable edges. So they exist over periods of time. They drive consistent consumption. So the answer is absolutely both to your question, yes. \nKeith Weiss: Got it. And if I could sneak in one follow-up for Mike. The 27 customers getting to that $1 million-plus level this quarter, that's a real eye-popping number. I think that's more than you did in the first 3 quarters all of last year. Anything in particular getting that motion going faster? And on the other side of the equation, is that a number we could expect to see on a go-forward basis? Or is that kind of too high of an expectation to have for the remainder of the year? \nMichael Scarpelli: Well, I'm not going to guide to $1 million customers. All I will say is there's a number of -- as there was going into this quarter, we had a number of customers on the cusp of going to $1 million, and we continue to see a number, and I think it's going to be very strong growth. But what I want to remind people is, when we land a customer, it takes many times, 6 to 9 months -- I think it's closer to 9 months -- before a customer actually starts to consume at their contract rate. And so a lot of this is the impact of really focusing on larger customers over the last 1.5 years that we're starting to see that pay off.\n But what I will say is of that 104 customers, only, I think, about 25% of those are actually majors, and then the balance is enterprise customers. So think about Fortune 500. Only about 25% are Fortune 500. The others are across-the-board end customers. And my point there is even small companies can be big consumers of Snowflake. And there's a lot of them, as I said, that are just on that cusp. So we expect that to continue. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen. \nJames Wood: Great. Congrats on a great quarter. Frank, I'd love to hear about what's causing the breakout and growth in international regions? I know you guys had some leadership changes. I'm sure you're feeding more headcount there. So how much is kind of your own efforts versus other factors like market awareness or growing cloud acceptance or anything else you'd call out? \nFrank Slootman: No, it's exactly what you just said. I mean we just needed to properly operationalize ourselves in these geographies. As you know, it's market by market. We have to have the correct leadership in place. We have made a lot of leadership changes in these regions that we're very pleased with. When you have a great product like Snowflake, I mean the impact of that is going to come fast and furiously. So I'm personally going to invest a bunch of time in Europe, given my own background, because I think the opportunity is tremendous. So we're excited that we actually see these regions coming online and contributing and we expect that to continue. We're very happy with the latest changes we made in Asia Pacific as well. We have very high expectations of Japan, obviously, ANZ and there's other markets where we're going to be starting to open up as well. \nJames Wood: That's great. And maybe one for Mike. I mean numbers look great across the board. The one outlier was the Fortune 500, which looked like kind of a slower net add in Q1. Anything you could kind of speak to this number, maybe seasonality or thoughts around what to expect going forward. \nMichael Scarpelli: Well, these large accounts are very, very long sales cycles, and you are going to see lumpiness in the additions. Obviously, Q4 was a strong quarter. And as one would expect, that's just landing a customer. That doesn't mean it contributed to revenue. As I said, most of those Fortune 500, we landed in Q4. We've seen virtually no revenue from them yet today. I can't stress that enough. And given Q4 is the end of a commission year for people and accelerators, reps do everything natural to close everything in the end of that commission year. So I fully expect we'll continue to close Fortune 500 the balance of the year. And it's all based upon when the customer is ready to begin that journey. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. \nKasthuri Rangan: Congratulations on the quarter. Two questions. One is you talked about never-ending replacement of data warehousing. If you could just expand on that, I'm fascinated because we seem to think -- at least I seem to think -- the data warehousing is just a small subsegment of the database market. But your comments seem to suggest that it's a longer-term, longer-tailed growth opportunity, that very core of the business. And one for you, Mike, I know that for your guidance, it doesn't look like you're assuming a big flow-through of this beat. Is that again because you do not want to forecast increases in consumption revenue? Is that why the revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter is conservative? \nFrank Slootman: Yes. Kash, Frank. Yes, we're actually super early innings on replacing these legacy on-premise data warehouses license. And actually, you see that in some of Teradata's number that they're actually hanging on to their business, one of the reasons it's been. We think Snowflake has really been the only company that's been successful in transitioning these legacy systems. We've not seen it done successfully by the public cloud companies. So most of that opportunity is still there and it's still coming. That's why I think it is, for all intents and purposes, indefinitely. So much of our business is actually not coming from those sources. But our expectation is that it will continue to contribute materially to our business for a very long period of time. \nMichael Scarpelli: On your question, Kash, on the beat, we did flow the beat through to the full year guidance, plus about $1 million more, but we also had the headwind going to the full year. As I mentioned, we introduced new storage compression technology that we literally just rolled out. And based upon the early feedback of that, it's going to take about $13 million of our revenue away from the company because the economics of our storage is so much better for our customer, with that compression being much higher than we were expecting it to be. Switch is a good thing for our customers. And longer term, it's going to drive more -- it's going to cause customers to put more data in Snowflake, which will ultimately drive more consumption. \nKasthuri Rangan: Wonderful. And Frank, if I could just follow up very quickly. The cloud-based -- the hyperscalers have their own data warehouse cloud offerings. Why is it that Snowflake has been able to keep them at bay? I know they are partners of yours. That doesn't get in the way of sometimes you compete in this market. Any structural barriers and advantages that you guys have against the hyperscalers that have their own cloud-based data warehouse? \nFrank Slootman: Well, I can go on and on about what all the reasons are. But for the purposes of this call, one of the things that makes Snowflake completely different is that our founding team started with a clean sheet of paper. They obviously were deeply steeped in database technology over a very long period of time. And they were looking to absolutely not carry any legacy forward that they didn't like and really reinvent architecturally for cloud scale computing, which is very, very different from on-premise. So it was incredibly different, very, very innovative. As a result, we're not straddling the on-premise and public cloud environments. We're only in the public cloud.\n And it's very important. I mean you look at a lot of the public cloud companies. They have carried, not only architecture, but actual code forward from our private environment. They've tried to evolve that and adapt that. The thing that we always say is say, look, it's hard to catch up when you're not sitting on a good architecture. You're only going to get further behind. Architecture matters. It matters a whole lot. And this is really what the strength of Snowflake is rooted in its core architecture, something you should never lose sight of. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. \nS. Kirk Materne: Frank, I was wondering if you could maybe just expand a little bit on your comments on the verticals. It seems to me, when we start thinking about the data sharing opportunity, landing some of those key beachhead clients in each vertical is going to be really important to sort of build out beyond that. And I guess, along those lines, I was just kind of curious where you think you are in each of those 6 verticals. There's a couple that are maybe ahead of the game, on sort of building out sort of real market knowledge, having salespeople and understand the intricacies of each of those verticals versus maybe the ones that you still need to do some work on. \nFrank Slootman: Yes. That's kind of a broad-ranging question. And again, we definitely come and see us at Summit because we're going to showcase a lot of customers in these verticals. You can hear directly from them in terms of what they're doing and how they're doing it. But our largest vertical, and this may actually surprise some people, is actually in media, in streaming content and advertising. It's actually not that much of a surprise because they are a digital-to-consumer business in a lot of way for companies like Hulu and Disney and Comcast and NBCUniversal to render businesses. And they are very sophisticated, very advanced. And obviously, because of the dominance in advertising of the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Google, this is very, very important to them. How to develop their businesses in Snowflake is really a key enabler for that for many reasons. And so that's just one example of a business that is extremely active with Snowflake at this point because of the strategic challenges that are going on over there.\n Second largest vertical is actually financial that might not be large financial institutions. That may not be much of a surprise because they tend to be -- for most software companies, health care, life sciences is huge. Retail, obviously, in consumer packaged goods is very, very big for us for similar reasons because digital transformation is so large in that part of the world. Of course, the advertising side, a very big thing over there as well. Public sector software companies is a very large component of our business because many, many software companies out there, and you'll see a lot of that at our Summit event, are re-platforming on top of Snowflake, Snowflake becoming a core part of their stack.\n So there's a lot of moving parts in our world. We're really excited about progress we have made as a company that we no longer sell exclusively on architectural distinction. We really crossed over into the customers' business, really enabling their challenges, their outcomes. And it makes us a much higher value-added partner than we historically have been when we were just focused on shifting and lifting workloads from on-premise to the cloud. \nS. Kirk Materne: Yes. That's really helpful. And Mike, if I could just squeeze in a really quick one. Given your consumption model and we're heading into the summer season, is there any way to think about in terms of seasonality from just consumption over the summer? Over the years, we've seen sort of bookings trends, obviously, come down a little bit in say the third quarter. Is there anything we should consider in terms of your full year guidance on that front? \nMichael Scarpelli: First of all, it's factored into that, but there is no -- you see more seasonality on weekends, obviously, because there's not as many employees in the office, but a lot of our workloads still run on weekends, too. So it's not like it drops to 0. So clearly, around holidays, you do see some. But it's not as profound in terms of people taking vacation in December that you see a big drop off consumption. We really haven't seen that. \nS. Kirk Materne: Congrats. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. \nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Maybe 2 for Mike. Mike, any noticeable change in the revenue mix between Snowflake on AWS versus Snowflake on Azure? And then I've got a quick follow-up. \nMichael Scarpelli: I will still say AWS is still our biggest. But Azure from new bookings, as we get into large enterprise, that continues to increase as a percent. But still, AWS is our biggest from new bookings. \nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Makes sense. And then, Mike, just as a follow-up, interesting on the storage compression change and the delta in terms of the revenues. I'm just wondering whether that's symbolic of any change in pricing strategy. Maybe you, Frank and the team have a greater willingness now to pass these types of cost savings on to customers to drive future growth. Or was this change a little bit more onetime as just opposed to a real high-level pricing strategy change? \nMichael Scarpelli: Well, I'll be transparent. I learned a lot in this process. So this is something the company has historically done about every 2 years. There's a big focus on new compression technology for storage. And the impact of it was bigger than we would have thought. And we only knew that once we actually got real live examples from customers. And our philosophy has always been to pass that on to customers. But there's other performance improvements as well. For instance, we're working on a new chip technology that will dramatically increase performance or improve performance. We do expect that to have an impact, and that's more of next year you'll see that. And we have always done that and continue to improve the performance of our product that goes directly to the benefit of our customers. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. \nGregg Moskowitz: Congratulations. I had a follow-up on secure data sharing. So as that ramps, naturally, your consumption is going to rise by a lot but so too will the complexity of all the data sets being shared in all kinds of intricate ways. And so I'm wondering, do you have any concerns about maintaining a high level of security and governance on the platform as that unfolds? \nFrank Slootman: It's Frank. The answer is no, not really, because data sharing is completely integral to our architecture. In other words, we're deploying the exact same security model that we deploy for internal as we do for external security. So as I said earlier, architecture matters. And this is 1 product that is beautifully designed, doing exactly what it does. It is not a bolt-on. It's not a hack. It's just incredibly well implemented. So the answer would be no to your question. \nGregg Moskowitz: Great. That's helpful. And then a quick follow-up for Mike. So you mentioned that EMEA bookings grew over 200%, Asia Pac over 300%. Does this reflect acceleration? Can you say what the growth looks like in fiscal '21? \nMichael Scarpelli: What I will say is both EMEA and APAC exceeded their plan. They had very strong quarters. We saw $1 million plus -- it was actually a multimillion dollar deal we did in EMEA with a big pharmaceutical company. And we landed a very nice customer in Japan as well. So very strong across the board, I would say, performance in EMEA and APAC. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. \nRaimo Lenschow: Congrats from me as well. A quick question. Frank, as you look into the replacement cycle, and you kind of pointed out you're the one that actually does it properly, what do you think around the partner capacity to help you there? You mentioned Deloitte already, obviously, as kind of one big one, but I assume just getting off of Teradata is actually quite a big job with kind of a lot of extra work involved. How happy are you with the channel there? And then I have one follow-up for Mike. \nFrank Slootman: Well, we're happy in places I highlighted. Our relationship with Deloitte, who is our lead partner, they went from a standing start a little bit over a year ago to $100 million of business, which is an absolutely ripping trajectory that they're on. It just shows here that demand for these migrations is enormous. We have a lot of engagement from all the other big names out there, whether it's Capgemini or Infosys, obviously, Accenture and so on. But they're all scrambling to certify, to staff, to provision. Our professional services organization is actually, by far, the best at this. And that's obviously a logical consequence of the fact because this is all we do.\n So we're really using our own abilities to help leverage them into the business. And it's not easy because the ramp is so steep for everybody, and we've got to make sure that we do an absolutely terrific job for our customers because these migrations are not easy, they're not cheap, there's risk involved and so on. And that's really the friction in the marketplace. So it's actually very welcome that the system integrators are leaning in as hard as they are, but the enablement for them to become really effective large grown businesses is sort of the day-to-day challenge that we have. But I view it as all good work that we do. \nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay. Makes sense. And then, Mike, the storage compression, et cetera, like does that impact gross margins? This might be a stupid question, but like the 72% is really, really high. So now everyone is wondering like how do you manage to get so quickly there and is there kind of more upside next year with more compression, et cetera. Or is it totally unrelated? \nMichael Scarpelli: Well, what I will say is it does improve margins. And the way it improves margin is because storage becomes more efficient. Storage is a smaller component of the overall mix of the revenue, and compute is the real value of our software that drives more margin. And I will say we did roll this out in April, and you do see some of that coming into an impact on last quarter. But we did say at our IPO, if you remember, we thought we could get to the mid-70s. That might feel very good that we'll get to the mid-70s. It's going to take some time. And stay tuned for our Investor Day, and we'll talk more about that later. I would say the biggest improvement we've seen to date in the gross margin has really been the renegotiation of our contracts with our cloud vendors and the discipline in our sales organization around discounting and coupled with the fact that as we move into larger enterprises, we're selling more business-critical enterprise, which attract a higher contribution margin. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. \nBrent Thill: Mike, just on quota-carrying reps this year. If you're not giving a number, can you just give us a sense of are you going to keep the same trajectory of growth you added last year or trying to get more productivity out of the reps you added. Just any color around on the quota-carrying side would be helpful. \nMichael Scarpelli: Well, we don't disclose quota-carrying reps. And what I will say is we're going to add about 1,200 net employees for the full year, and we do expect that we'll add about the same level into our sales organization this year as we did last year. \nBrent Thill: So same number of absolute reps? \nMichael Scarpelli: Correct. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. \nDavid Hynes: Frank, I want to ask about Snowflake Ventures. You called out ThoughtSpot, DataIQ. I know DataRobot's in the portfolio. So obviously, analytics and ML, AI are logical targets. Just curious like where else are you seeing interesting stuff happening in the ecosystem as it pertains to driving volumes to Snowflake? \nFrank Slootman: Yes. Areas like governance. Obviously, governance is becoming such a huge aspect of data operations in large institutions. When I say governance, it really relates to security as well as probably to see compliance. So we actually acquired a company last year by the name of CryptoNumerics, and that is now actually flowing into our platform, and we have the ability to anonymize PI data and things of that sort. Super, super important that customers can really feel safe on our platform and they allow data on our platform, that it is fully governed. I mean it's been a big issue, but it's literally growing in importance quarter-on-quarter. And a lot of our large customers are really organizing themselves to maintain that kind of posture.\n There's areas in data cataloging. I mean there's a whole ecosystem around our platform. What we like about investing is not just the upside in terms of the investments, but we get to build closer relationship with these customers on the basis of the investments, much more seamless integrations, better customer experiences. And that's what we like to do. I mean we're very much an ecosystem-oriented company rather than we have one flavor, and that's what you're going to use. We want to make sure that the whole ecosystem feels like a very good experience to our customers. So we look for opportunities. We see a lot, and we're happy with the number of investments that we've done, and we're looking at new stuff continually, yes. \nDavid Hynes: Yes. Yes. Obviously, some good ones in the portfolio already. Mike, a follow-up to you. So Raimo asked about gross margins as it pertains to kind of storage compression technology. I was going to ask -- if I think about the trajectories kind of you guys expand into, doing more with unstructured data, I think there are heavy demands on storage there, like how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins as we get to that mid-70s target? I mean is it fair to think that it could dip in the interim? Or what's the right way to think about that? \nMichael Scarpelli: I don't see a dip happening in our product gross margins at all, but there is a limit to where you can get to. And when we're going through our IPO, people were asking questions. I did say I don't see us getting into the 80s. I can see a path to the mid-70s. We may, one day, be able to get into the high 70s. But given the storage component and the costs associated with the public clouds are in there, it's pretty hard to get beyond this. \nDavid Hynes: Makes sense. Nice numbers, guys. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. \nBrad Reback: Mike, I think last quarter, you talked about investments in FedRAMP. Can you maybe give us an update where you stand? And do you think the federal vertical could be a contributor in fiscal '23? \nMichael Scarpelli: So there's FedRAMP high we're working on. ITAR is going to be out mid this year, FedRAMP high end of the year. And obviously, if we didn't see a big opportunity, because there is a big cost associated with doing that, we wouldn't be doing it. And we have a very good pipeline within the public sector. And we're very focused on it. As of today, it's not a big driver of revenue. So there's a lot of upside there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. \nTyler Radke: Maybe to start with Frank, I think earlier in the call, you talked about how kind of the legacy data warehouse migration has been a really important go-to-market motion. I'm curious, given your focus on the Data Cloud, like are you changing at all in terms of the initial use case that you're leading with? Perhaps, given the success you're seeing with data sharing and data marketplace, do you find that those are easier to perhaps land a new customer with given that it's more greenfield and less of a large-scale legacy database migration? \nFrank Slootman: Well, the thing that happens is when people move these legacy workloads to the cloud and you're running a platform like Snowflake, all of a sudden, you're finding out that workloads can run orders of magnitude faster. In other words, not like after 3 weeks, I populated my warehouse. I'm now populating the dashboard, running the reports. People are almost -- they've already moved on by the time they get data. When you accelerate that time frame -- we often talk about this whole concept of the time value of data. If you get data -- most of our customers are now on a 24-hour cycle, but that's now moving up, right, where people are seeing data in hours and minutes. And we're very aggressively working to event architectures where you get to sort of near-real time, not in the computer science sense of real time but in the visceral sense, it's near-real time.\n So you're now looking at data very differently than you did before where you have to wait for days and weeks for it to see it. Now it's showing up very quickly. That completely changes people's perspective what they can do with it, right? And that is what is so different, so different. That is enabled by the public cloud coupled with Snowflake architecture. That is what's driving the consumption of high net revenue retention rates because people are discovering completely new use cases and things they can do that were never a consideration in previous times. It's very important that this whole static batch-oriented way of thinking we have in data warehouses is completely different now. Okay. \nTyler Radke: And then a follow-up for Mike. I know that the current -- you don't really have a current RPO because, obviously, it's a consumption-oriented model. But in terms of your comments on the percentage of RPO that's expected to be recognized in the next 12 months, I just wanted to confirm, it seem like the growth in that number picked up quite a bit from the last few quarters. So number one, I just wanted to confirm the growth rate on that number; and number two, just understand kind of the factors that drove what would seem like a good bookings performance here in Q1. \nMichael Scarpelli: Well, it was a strong Q1 and bookings performance. And we estimate that 54% of that RPO will roll off into revenue over the next 12 months, and it was 54% -- 55% last quarter. And I don't know what else there is to say about that, but that's how we see it rolling off to revenue. \nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Kamil Mielszarek with William Blair. \nKamil Mielczarek: Congrats on the great start to the year. I have a follow-up on the targeted 1,200 headcount increase this year. Can you update us on the execution to date? And should we expect that to be front-end loaded? And maybe could you provide the split between the first half and the second half of the year? \nMichael Scarpelli: Well, as I said in the remarks, we onboarded 436 net employees in the first half of the year. And so 1,200 is definitely front-end loaded. We always try to add a lot of people into our sales and marketing organization in the first month of the year to get the benefit of our sales kickoff. But definitely, we're going to continue to add in the first half, and it's going to be more skewed to that. \nKamil Mielczarek: That's helpful. And you've delivered incredible RPO growth over the past -- it's been over 200%, I guess, for the past few years now. Can you provide an update on contract duration, how that's changing? Is that something being pushed by your sales team? Or is that just a function of more penetration at the enterprise level? \nMichael Scarpelli: Well, last year was the first year we really incentivized our sales force to sell multiyear contracts. And what I would say is now it's getting more into the normal sales motion of our salespeople. It's more natural for them to be going in and asking customers to sign a 3-year contract. Historically, we used to sell 1-year contracts only. And so we still do have renewals. There are still some customers on renewals that only want to do a 1-year renewal because that's what they've always done. And there are some customers, especially ones where they're new customers, they want to do a 1-year contract because they want to get to know us more. Generally, those newer customers we're finding on renewals are doing the multiyear renewals with us as they're seeing everything they can do on Snowflake. But that's fully reflected in our RPO. \nKamil Mielczarek: Makes sense. And congrats again. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Scarpelli",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. We saw continued momentum in Q1 with another quarter of great execution at the start of our fiscal year. Our Q1 product revenues were $214 million, representing 110% year-over-year growth. Our remaining performance obligations were $1.4 billion. Media and telecom, technology and financial services customers drove the outperformance, and we saw meaningful growth from our health care customers. Our strong RPO results reflect more multimillion-dollar relationships with particular strength in the telecom and technology sectors. Of the $1.4 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 54% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.\n Growth in our existing customer base continues to propel our results. We added 393 net new customers in Q1, including 3 7-figure new logos. These customers only accounted for 1% of revenues. We are hyper-focused on penetrating the largest enterprises globally as we believe these organizations provide the largest opportunity for account expansion.\n We are already benefiting from our maturing enterprise sales efforts. In Q1, the number of customers with greater than $1 million and trailing 12-month product revenue increased to 104, up from 77 last quarter. When we expand within our largest customers, we typically replace more than 1 solution. In many cases, we replace on-premise and first-generation cloud solutions, and we address new workloads. Snowflake creates use cases that were previously impossible. This is what fuels our 168% net revenue retention rate, and we remain confident that our net revenue retention will stay above 160% for the fiscal year.\n We continue to invest in our international opportunity and believe there is significant runway ahead of us. As Frank mentioned, we are seeing tremendous growth within EMEA and APAC geographies as our sales organization take shape. We believe we are in the early innings of addressing the largest enterprises abroad. First quarter was a record hiring quarter for us. We onboarded 436 net new employees. We continue to target the highest performing employees, prioritizing talent acquisition and product, engineering and enterprise sales groups.\n Turning to margins. On a non-GAAP basis, our product gross margin was 72%, up 600 basis points from last year. Favorable cloud service agreements, growing scales across regions and our enterprise customer success all contribute to steady gross margin improvements. Operating margin was negative 16%, benefiting from revenue outperformance.\n Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 10%, positively impacted by strong collections from Q4 bookings and operating margin outperformance. As a reminder, adjusted free cash flow excludes the impact of net cash paid or received on both employee and employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock option transactions. This quarter, we saw a $10 million impact from those items. While we continue to focus on long-term margin expansion and profitability, we do experience free cash flow seasonality. In fiscal '21, Q1 and Q4 were our strongest free cash flow quarters, while Q2 was our weakest. We expect to experience the seasonality in future periods.\n We maintained our strong cash position with approximately $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Snowflake Ventures leverages this position to evaluate strategic opportunities with announced investments in ThoughtSpot and DataIQ in the quarter. We continue to provide high-growth companies with capital to engage more with the Data Cloud.\n Now let's turn to our guidance and outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $235 million and $240 million, representing year-over-year growth between 88% and 92%.\n Turning to margins. We expect, on a non-GAAP basis, negative 19% operating margin, and we expect 297 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect product revenues between $1.02 billion and $1.035 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 84% and 87%. This includes an estimated negative $13 million impact from a storage compression improvement we just introduced that benefits our customers. We regularly introduce product and performance enhancements that lower the cost for our customers to run Snowflake, and we believe this will drive more compute within the platform longer term.\n Turning to profitability. We expect, on a non-GAAP basis, 72% product gross margin, negative 17% operating margin and breakeven adjusted free cash flow, and we expect 299 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our outlook still assumes that we will add more than 1,200 net new employees during the fiscal year.\n With respect to COVID, our forecast assumes that we will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future with an increase to travel expenses in the back half of the year. While we anticipate an eventual return to the office, we do not have a specific time line for that goal.\n And lastly, we will host our first virtual Investor Day on June 10 in conjunction with Snowflake Summit. You can register for the event at investors.snowflake.com.\n With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Remember, our revenue is based on actual customer consumption. It's not a ratable recognition. So we did have -- as I mentioned, we did have some outperformance in some specific customers. And part of that is tied to certain projects they're working on. And just because a customer consumes a certain amount one quarter doesn't mean they're going to consume that same amount next quarter if they're not running those same projects. And so we are very happy with the revenue outperformance in Q1. And our guidance reflects where we think we're going to be for the balance of the year. Well, I'm not going to guide to $1 million customers. All I will say is there's a number of -- as there was going into this quarter, we had a number of customers on the cusp of going to $1 million, and we continue to see a number, and I think it's going to be very strong growth. But what I want to remind people is, when we land a customer, it takes many times, 6 to 9 months -- I think it's closer to 9 months -- before a customer actually starts to consume at their contract rate. And so a lot of this is the impact of really focusing on larger customers over the last 1.5 years that we're starting to see that pay off.\n But what I will say is of that 104 customers, only, I think, about 25% of those are actually majors, and then the balance is enterprise customers. So think about Fortune 500. Only about 25% are Fortune 500. The others are across-the-board end customers. And my point there is even small companies can be big consumers of Snowflake. And there's a lot of them, as I said, that are just on that cusp. So we expect that to continue. Well, these large accounts are very, very long sales cycles, and you are going to see lumpiness in the additions. Obviously, Q4 was a strong quarter. And as one would expect, that's just landing a customer. That doesn't mean it contributed to revenue. As I said, most of those Fortune 500, we landed in Q4. We've seen virtually no revenue from them yet today. I can't stress that enough. And given Q4 is the end of a commission year for people and accelerators, reps do everything natural to close everything in the end of that commission year. So I fully expect we'll continue to close Fortune 500 the balance of the year. And it's all based upon when the customer is ready to begin that journey. On your question, Kash, on the beat, we did flow the beat through to the full year guidance, plus about $1 million more, but we also had the headwind going to the full year. As I mentioned, we introduced new storage compression technology that we literally just rolled out. And based upon the early feedback of that, it's going to take about $13 million of our revenue away from the company because the economics of our storage is so much better for our customer, with that compression being much higher than we were expecting it to be. Switch is a good thing for our customers. And longer term, it's going to drive more -- it's going to cause customers to put more data in Snowflake, which will ultimately drive more consumption. First of all, it's factored into that, but there is no -- you see more seasonality on weekends, obviously, because there's not as many employees in the office, but a lot of our workloads still run on weekends, too. So it's not like it drops to 0. So clearly, around holidays, you do see some. But it's not as profound in terms of people taking vacation in December that you see a big drop off consumption. We really haven't seen that. I will still say AWS is still our biggest. But Azure from new bookings, as we get into large enterprise, that continues to increase as a percent. But still, AWS is our biggest from new bookings. Well, I'll be transparent. I learned a lot in this process. So this is something the company has historically done about every 2 years. There's a big focus on new compression technology for storage. And the impact of it was bigger than we would have thought. And we only knew that once we actually got real live examples from customers. And our philosophy has always been to pass that on to customers. But there's other performance improvements as well. For instance, we're working on a new chip technology that will dramatically increase performance or improve performance. We do expect that to have an impact, and that's more of next year you'll see that. And we have always done that and continue to improve the performance of our product that goes directly to the benefit of our customers. What I will say is both EMEA and APAC exceeded their plan. They had very strong quarters. We saw $1 million plus -- it was actually a multimillion dollar deal we did in EMEA with a big pharmaceutical company. And we landed a very nice customer in Japan as well. So very strong across the board, I would say, performance in EMEA and APAC. Well, what I will say is it does improve margins. And the way it improves margin is because storage becomes more efficient. Storage is a smaller component of the overall mix of the revenue, and compute is the real value of our software that drives more margin. And I will say we did roll this out in April, and you do see some of that coming into an impact on last quarter. But we did say at our IPO, if you remember, we thought we could get to the mid-70s. That might feel very good that we'll get to the mid-70s. It's going to take some time. And stay tuned for our Investor Day, and we'll talk more about that later. I would say the biggest improvement we've seen to date in the gross margin has really been the renegotiation of our contracts with our cloud vendors and the discipline in our sales organization around discounting and coupled with the fact that as we move into larger enterprises, we're selling more business-critical enterprise, which attract a higher contribution margin. Well, we don't disclose quota-carrying reps. And what I will say is we're going to add about 1,200 net employees for the full year, and we do expect that we'll add about the same level into our sales organization this year as we did last year. Correct. I don't see a dip happening in our product gross margins at all, but there is a limit to where you can get to. And when we're going through our IPO, people were asking questions. I did say I don't see us getting into the 80s. I can see a path to the mid-70s. We may, one day, be able to get into the high 70s. But given the storage component and the costs associated with the public clouds are in there, it's pretty hard to get beyond this. So there's FedRAMP high we're working on. ITAR is going to be out mid this year, FedRAMP high end of the year. And obviously, if we didn't see a big opportunity, because there is a big cost associated with doing that, we wouldn't be doing it. And we have a very good pipeline within the public sector. And we're very focused on it. As of today, it's not a big driver of revenue. So there's a lot of upside there. Well, it was a strong Q1 and bookings performance. And we estimate that 54% of that RPO will roll off into revenue over the next 12 months, and it was 54% -- 55% last quarter. And I don't know what else there is to say about that, but that's how we see it rolling off to revenue. Well, as I said in the remarks, we onboarded 436 net employees in the first half of the year. And so 1,200 is definitely front-end loaded. We always try to add a lot of people into our sales and marketing organization in the first month of the year to get the benefit of our sales kickoff. But definitely, we're going to continue to add in the first half, and it's going to be more skewed to that. Well, last year was the first year we really incentivized our sales force to sell multiyear contracts. And what I would say is now it's getting more into the normal sales motion of our salespeople. It's more natural for them to be going in and asking customers to sign a 3-year contract. Historically, we used to sell 1-year contracts only. And so we still do have renewals. There are still some customers on renewals that only want to do a 1-year renewal because that's what they've always done. And there are some customers, especially ones where they're new customers, they want to do a 1-year contract because they want to get to know us more. Generally, those newer customers we're finding on renewals are doing the multiyear renewals with us as they're seeing everything they can do on Snowflake. But that's fully reflected in our RPO."

            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks, Jimmy. Good afternoon, everybody. We reported strong Q1 results with 110% year-on-year growth to $214 million in product revenues, reflecting strength in Snowflake consumption. Remaining performance obligations grew 206% year-on-year to $1.4 billion, indicating strength in sales across the board. While maintaining a net revenue retention rate of 168%, we also generated $23 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter.\n We are expanding our geographical scope in all 3 major theaters. Both EMEA and APJ have breakout bookings quarters. EMEA grew more than 200% and Asia Pacific grew more than 300% year-over-year. At the end of Q1, we had 104 customers with over $1 million in product revenue, an increase from 77 in the previous quarter. During Q1, we had key enterprise wins, including Datadog, Equifax and Walgreens Boots Alliance.\n Our growth trajectory is a function of several factors. First, the modernization from on-premise to cloud computing is changing the landscape. Customers are moving workloads to public clouds to take advantage of unlimited capacity at scale and the utility model with less than paid by the drink. Secondly, through Snowflake's cloud-native software architecture, customers achieve remarkable gains in performance, economy and data governance. Third, customers are now seeking to transform from a world where data informs people to one in which data drives operations directly. Data drives digital transformation. Data is the beating heart of the modern enterprise. And Snowflake is becoming a core infrastructure to the digital economy.\n The data economy has seen some lift from the pandemic dislocation, but these are our long-term secular trends enabled by new technology. Aside from pent-up demand, the possibilities are only limited now by one's imagination and budgets. Part of our growth at scale strategy has been our transition to the Data Cloud. Our original focus of targeting legacy data warehouse workloads is going strong, and that will continue indefinitely. It has been a tried-and-true strategy for Snowflake. Snowflake has now processed more than 1 billion queries in a day, and that number grew more than 100% year-on-year.\n But our view of the future is more ambitious. We seek to build and deploy core infrastructure for the digital economy, and the Data Cloud is exactly that. Data Cloud is an active dynamic hub of thousands of data relationships between Snowflake parties. Many of these relationships are with data providers through the Snowflake Data Marketplace and many others are our key business partners. Data providers like ZoomInfo and Foursquare are using the Data Cloud to unlock more value to their business. Health care organizations are using data insights to improve quality of patient care. Retailers like Albertsons are sharing data with consumer packaged goods companies, and media companies are accelerating advertising revenue with the Snowflake Data Marketplace.\n Historically, data warehouses refreshed through large batch processes on a periodic basis. That's because data was force-fed into them from different sources. Today, the Data Cloud is near-real time with data continuously pulsing through the cloud being analyzed and acted on, lights out and at light speed. There are no limits anymore on how many analytical processes can run concurrently against the same data and how frequently they are run. This has changed people's perceptions of what is possible.\n The Data Cloud is the sum of all data networking relationships that are active at any point in time. We track these relationships through what we call edges. At the end of the quarter, 15% of our rapidly expanding customer base had data edges in place with external Snowflake accounts compared to 10% a year ago. And the number of edges in this period grew 33% quarter-on-quarter. Customer share data for many reasons that are specific to them and their industries, but they all seek to enrich their data, gain more effective analytical insights and do so faster and more cost effectively.\n Snowflake's focus on vertical industries is well underway. We've organized our organization around 6 core verticals. They are financial services; health care and life sciences; retail and consumer packaged goods; advertising, media and entertainment; technology; and public sector. This vertical industry focus will intensify across our sales, marketing, alliances, product and service organizations. As a result, we expect Snowflake to become as visible and a large enterprise IT environment as in the line of business themselves. While the company maintains a geographical backbone in markets around the world, the industry aperture is rapidly coming into focus.\n Our partners are also stepping up to Snowflake, which is a key element of our strategy. Deloitte crossed the $100 million mark on Snowflake Business, which was the fastest ramp ever from a standing start for an alliance. We will host the annual Snowflake Summit June 8 through 10. More than 50,000 attendees are expected, including 60-plus customer sessions with the likes of Adobe, BlackRock, Capital One, Goldman Sachs, Instacart, Kraft Heinz, JetBlue, Morgan Stanley and NBCUniversal. We invite investors to attend, get a better understanding of our Data Cloud strategy and hear the latest news on platform enhancements, optimization, data governance and vertical industry use cases.\n In closing, Q1 was a great start to the fiscal year, and we are much looking forward to the balance of the year.\n With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. Well, Brett, the answer is really both. Customers need to walk before they run. So a lot of their initial focus is on workload transitions and so on. But everybody has a very, very keen view in terms of where they want to be, where they're going to be over time. And you're exactly right, data sharing is absolutely essential. It will really enable data sciences in order to create context around data, in order to enrich data to really fully reach that potential. I mean it's taken us some time to really evangelize this whole idea. But as you said, it is resonating very, very aggressively in the marketplace.\n We have a lot going on in our vertical markets that are very specific to those contexts, very specific to the unique circumstances of vertical industries. So we're really excited. We're very well positioned for it. And we have really developed our Data Cloud and our Snowflake Data Marketplace to the point where it's completely operational. And hope we'll see you at our Investor Day because not only we want to talk about it, we're also going to show you a bunch of stuff and see how far we've come in that area. Well, the answer is both, obviously, it's going to make things incredibly sticky. But for us to designate something as an edge, it has to have a minimal amount of time in terms of durable consumption. So there's very much a consumption dimension to these edges that we track and mods or otherwise, we don't consider it an edge in our world. In other words, they have to be durable and stable because a lot of data relationships are transient. They exist for a period of time. They exist for a project, maybe a trial, whatever it is. But that's not -- that's also a metric that we follow where we really look for, what we'd call, stable or durable edges. So they exist over periods of time. They drive consistent consumption. So the answer is absolutely both to your question, yes. No, it's exactly what you just said. I mean we just needed to properly operationalize ourselves in these geographies. As you know, it's market by market. We have to have the correct leadership in place. We have made a lot of leadership changes in these regions that we're very pleased with. When you have a great product like Snowflake, I mean the impact of that is going to come fast and furiously. So I'm personally going to invest a bunch of time in Europe, given my own background, because I think the opportunity is tremendous. So we're excited that we actually see these regions coming online and contributing and we expect that to continue. We're very happy with the latest changes we made in Asia Pacific as well. We have very high expectations of Japan, obviously, ANZ and there's other markets where we're going to be starting to open up as well. Yes. Kash, Frank. Yes, we're actually super early innings on replacing these legacy on-premise data warehouses license. And actually, you see that in some of Teradata's number that they're actually hanging on to their business, one of the reasons it's been. We think Snowflake has really been the only company that's been successful in transitioning these legacy systems. We've not seen it done successfully by the public cloud companies. So most of that opportunity is still there and it's still coming. That's why I think it is, for all intents and purposes, indefinitely. So much of our business is actually not coming from those sources. But our expectation is that it will continue to contribute materially to our business for a very long period of time. Well, I can go on and on about what all the reasons are. But for the purposes of this call, one of the things that makes Snowflake completely different is that our founding team started with a clean sheet of paper. They obviously were deeply steeped in database technology over a very long period of time. And they were looking to absolutely not carry any legacy forward that they didn't like and really reinvent architecturally for cloud scale computing, which is very, very different from on-premise. So it was incredibly different, very, very innovative. As a result, we're not straddling the on-premise and public cloud environments. We're only in the public cloud.\n And it's very important. I mean you look at a lot of the public cloud companies. They have carried, not only architecture, but actual code forward from our private environment. They've tried to evolve that and adapt that. The thing that we always say is say, look, it's hard to catch up when you're not sitting on a good architecture. You're only going to get further behind. Architecture matters. It matters a whole lot. And this is really what the strength of Snowflake is rooted in its core architecture, something you should never lose sight of. Yes. That's kind of a broad-ranging question. And again, we definitely come and see us at Summit because we're going to showcase a lot of customers in these verticals. You can hear directly from them in terms of what they're doing and how they're doing it. But our largest vertical, and this may actually surprise some people, is actually in media, in streaming content and advertising. It's actually not that much of a surprise because they are a digital-to-consumer business in a lot of way for companies like Hulu and Disney and Comcast and NBCUniversal to render businesses. And they are very sophisticated, very advanced. And obviously, because of the dominance in advertising of the likes of Amazon, Facebook and Google, this is very, very important to them. How to develop their businesses in Snowflake is really a key enabler for that for many reasons. And so that's just one example of a business that is extremely active with Snowflake at this point because of the strategic challenges that are going on over there.\n Second largest vertical is actually financial that might not be large financial institutions. That may not be much of a surprise because they tend to be -- for most software companies, health care, life sciences is huge. Retail, obviously, in consumer packaged goods is very, very big for us for similar reasons because digital transformation is so large in that part of the world. Of course, the advertising side, a very big thing over there as well. Public sector software companies is a very large component of our business because many, many software companies out there, and you'll see a lot of that at our Summit event, are re-platforming on top of Snowflake, Snowflake becoming a core part of their stack.\n So there's a lot of moving parts in our world. We're really excited about progress we have made as a company that we no longer sell exclusively on architectural distinction. We really crossed over into the customers' business, really enabling their challenges, their outcomes. And it makes us a much higher value-added partner than we historically have been when we were just focused on shifting and lifting workloads from on-premise to the cloud. It's Frank. The answer is no, not really, because data sharing is completely integral to our architecture. In other words, we're deploying the exact same security model that we deploy for internal as we do for external security. So as I said earlier, architecture matters. And this is 1 product that is beautifully designed, doing exactly what it does. It is not a bolt-on. It's not a hack. It's just incredibly well implemented. So the answer would be no to your question. Well, we're happy in places I highlighted. Our relationship with Deloitte, who is our lead partner, they went from a standing start a little bit over a year ago to $100 million of business, which is an absolutely ripping trajectory that they're on. It just shows here that demand for these migrations is enormous. We have a lot of engagement from all the other big names out there, whether it's Capgemini or Infosys, obviously, Accenture and so on. But they're all scrambling to certify, to staff, to provision. Our professional services organization is actually, by far, the best at this. And that's obviously a logical consequence of the fact because this is all we do.\n So we're really using our own abilities to help leverage them into the business. And it's not easy because the ramp is so steep for everybody, and we've got to make sure that we do an absolutely terrific job for our customers because these migrations are not easy, they're not cheap, there's risk involved and so on. And that's really the friction in the marketplace. So it's actually very welcome that the system integrators are leaning in as hard as they are, but the enablement for them to become really effective large grown businesses is sort of the day-to-day challenge that we have. But I view it as all good work that we do. Yes. Areas like governance. Obviously, governance is becoming such a huge aspect of data operations in large institutions. When I say governance, it really relates to security as well as probably to see compliance. So we actually acquired a company last year by the name of CryptoNumerics, and that is now actually flowing into our platform, and we have the ability to anonymize PI data and things of that sort. Super, super important that customers can really feel safe on our platform and they allow data on our platform, that it is fully governed. I mean it's been a big issue, but it's literally growing in importance quarter-on-quarter. And a lot of our large customers are really organizing themselves to maintain that kind of posture.\n There's areas in data cataloging. I mean there's a whole ecosystem around our platform. What we like about investing is not just the upside in terms of the investments, but we get to build closer relationship with these customers on the basis of the investments, much more seamless integrations, better customer experiences. And that's what we like to do. I mean we're very much an ecosystem-oriented company rather than we have one flavor, and that's what you're going to use. We want to make sure that the whole ecosystem feels like a very good experience to our customers. So we look for opportunities. We see a lot, and we're happy with the number of investments that we've done, and we're looking at new stuff continually, yes. Well, the thing that happens is when people move these legacy workloads to the cloud and you're running a platform like Snowflake, all of a sudden, you're finding out that workloads can run orders of magnitude faster. In other words, not like after 3 weeks, I populated my warehouse. I'm now populating the dashboard, running the reports. People are almost -- they've already moved on by the time they get data. When you accelerate that time frame -- we often talk about this whole concept of the time value of data. If you get data -- most of our customers are now on a 24-hour cycle, but that's now moving up, right, where people are seeing data in hours and minutes. And we're very aggressively working to event architectures where you get to sort of near-real time, not in the computer science sense of real time but in the visceral sense, it's near-real time.\n So you're now looking at data very differently than you did before where you have to wait for days and weeks for it to see it. Now it's showing up very quickly. That completely changes people's perspective what they can do with it, right? And that is what is so different, so different. That is enabled by the public cloud coupled with Snowflake architecture. That is what's driving the consumption of high net revenue retention rates because people are discovering completely new use cases and things they can do that were never a consideration in previous times. It's very important that this whole static batch-oriented way of thinking we have in data warehouses is completely different now. Okay."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand over to Jimmy Sexton, Head of Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Sexton: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Snowflake's Q4 fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. With me in Bozeman, Montana are Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer; and Christian Kleinerman, our Senior Vice President of Product, who will join us for the Q&A session. During today's call, we will review our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 and our results of the first quarter and full year fiscal 2023. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, products and features, long-term growth, our stock repurchase program and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, that we will file with the SEC. We caution you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations. We'd also like to point out that on today's call, we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. To see the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings press release distributed earlier today in our investor presentation, which are posted at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks Jimmy. Good afternoon, everybody on the call. Q4 product revenue grew 54% year-on-year and for the fiscal year grew 70%, totaling $1.9 billion. Q4 net revenue retention was 158%. We continue to be on track for our $10 billion product revenue goal in fiscal '29. Remaining performance obligations grew 38% totaling $3.7 billion. We saw a measure of bookings renaissance with certain customer segments in Q4 reflecting a lack of visibility in the business and preferring a cautious short-term stance versus larger, longer term contract expansions. The contractual poster focused on sufficiently enabling consumption growth in the near term. This was more pronounced among international SMB and commercial customers and much less so at the high end of our customer base. We made substantial progress on our efficiency metrics. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter reached 6%. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin for the quarter was 37%. For the full fiscal year '23, non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 25%, totaling $120 million. But our data networking growth as measured by so-called stable edges grew 93% year-over-year. 23% of our customers now have at least one stable edge, up from 18% a year ago. Among $1 million consumption customers, 65% of them at, on average, six stable edges. Snowflake marketplace listings grew 8% quarter-over-quarter and now total over 1,500. During Q4, Snowpark for Python reached general availability status. Early traction is promising. 20% of customers have now tried Snowpark. Snowpark is initially focused on the adoption and migration of Spark workloads for data engineering and machine learning. Spark jobs typically are on cheaper and faster on Snowpark with the added benefits of superior governance and operational simplicity. POC activity is ramping fast and benchmark results so far indicate superior comparative results. The Fortune 500 customer loads 1 billion transaction records into Snowflake every day. This organization take $1 million after migrating work from Spark to Snowpark. The financial services customer is migrating workloads from Spark to Snowflake and Snowpark rent 8x faster at 30% of the cost. We entered private preview standards with what we call Streamlit and Snowflake. This is the replatforming of Streamlit inside of Snowflake. Streamlit is a popular application development framework for the Python developer community, especially those focused on machine learning applications. Streamlit enables the use of machine learning models and applications by a general business audience. In Q4, we announced our intent to acquire Mobileye net SnowConvert. SnowConvert's proprietary conversion tools enable migration from legacy platforms. SnowConvert also helps migrate Spark workloads to Snowpark, capabilities accelerate migration to Snowflake and the strategic nature of this acquisition. We are operating in a vast and growing market, generating free cash flow and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We focus on the business' hand and the outcomes we can control. We are prioritizing positions that directly support the core mission of the enterprise. Resources will continue to be concentrated on the roles that sell, support and build our products. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. Q4 product revenues were $555 million, representing 54% year-over-year growth and remaining performance obligations grew 38% year-over-year, totaling $3.7 billion. Of the $3.7 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. This represents a 48% increase compared to our estimate as of the same quarter last year. Our net revenue retention rate of 158% includes 13 new customers with $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue and reflects durable growth among our largest customers. The outperformance in Q4 was driven by longest tenured customers. We continue to see the greatest contribution from the financial services and media and entertainment verticals. We continue to focus on growth and efficiency. We generated $215 million in non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow outperforming our Q4 target. Full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 25%. Q4 bookings underperformed versus our expectations, pipeline conversion in the final two weeks of the quarter diverged from historical norms. International territories drove the largest underperformance relative to plan and multiyear bookings declined 15% year-on-year. While we are not okay with this outcome, customers' bookings behavior does not dictate their consumption patterns. Customers have the contractual right to sign smaller deals to bridge them to their contract end date. We are confident that our customers are committed to Snowflake and are increasingly focused on better managing their business during more uncertain times. Q4 represented another quarter of continued progress on profitability. Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 75% scale in our public cloud data centers continue growth in large customers' accounts in more favorable pricing with our cloud service providers will contribute to year-over-year gross margins improvements. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and savings on T&E and lower bad debt expense. Our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 37%, positively impacted by strong collections. We received some large customer payments in January that were expected in February. We ended the quarter in a strong cash position with $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments with no debt. As noted in the press release that went out earlier today, we have expanded our partnership with AWS over the next five years more than doubling our previous spend commitments to $2.5 billion. As part of the new AWS -- as part of the new agreement, AWS is committing to support joint go-to-market efforts, more favorable pricing. This partnership is aimed at driving growth in innovation. Now let's turn to our guidance. As of today, we have completed the Graviton2 migration in all of our active commercial AWS deployments. We remain committed to driving towards greater profitability. We are focused on growing revenue while expanding operating and free cash flow margins. The change in existing customer purchasing behavior, lower-than-expected new logo bookings and slower expected ramp from our youngest cohorts has led us to reevaluate our FY '24 outlook. For the first quarter, we expect product revenues between $568 million and $573 million, representing year-over-year growth between 44% and 45%. Turning to margins. We expect on a non-GAAP basis, 0% operating margin, and we expect 361 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2024, we expect product revenues of approximately $2.7 billion representing year-over-year growth of approximately 40%. Turning to profitability for the full year fiscal 2024, we expect on a non-GAAP basis, approximately 76% product gross margin, 6% operating margin and 25% adjusted free cash flow margin, and we expect 363 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. I would also like to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2 billion over the next two years. This program reflects our conviction in the business and allows us to use our expected free cash flow to manage dilution over this period. Our share count guidance does not include the impact from the stock repurchase. During fiscal 2023, we added approximately 1,900 net new employees. We view the current hiring market as favorable for Snowflake and we'll continue to prioritize hiring in product, engineering and sales. We expect to add more than 1,000 employees in fiscal 2024. We remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029, $10 billion product revenue target. We look forward to executing against our growing opportunity. And lastly, we will host our Investor Day on June 27 in Las Vegas in conjunction with Snowflake Summit, our annual users' conference. If you're interested in attending, please e-mail ir@snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMark Ronald: Mike, I'm curious if you have any insights into the consumption patterns that you saw generally, but including during the holiday periods, including MLK weekend and President's Day week. Is there anything -- any noteworthy change there? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nMike Scarpelli: There was nothing really noteworthy around the holidays. As we said, going into our Q4 guidance, we are factoring in the holidays. And clearly, we were 3% above our guidance, our actual results. And I will say President's Day was slow, but February is off to a very good start. It's kind of where we were expecting it to be.\nMark Ronald: Okay. As a follow-up, Frank, I wanted to ask you on the topic of generative AI and large language models. Can you frame up the opportunity there for Snowflake because I would think with the Unistore, you could probably handle all these chat logs. You could be training some of these models on very large data sets. I would think that Snowpipe's can pull in social media feeds and kind of help to improve those models. You see any customer activity around that vector or any tailwinds you think that could be developing in time?\nFrank Slootman: Well, it's still early in the cycle. Obviously, like everybody else, we're all over it in terms of evaluating where these technologies can make a difference. I mean the things that we sort of hone in on short term, is called completion code optimizations, things that are very, very clear business returns. One of the challenges with these new technologies that people come up with a lot of interesting questions, but without a solid business model that's not going to take off. So we take a very pragmatic view. We do anticipate that Snowflake data will be a very, very big driver of large language model in conjunction with many, many other data sources. So we think that the gravity around data will drive a lot of this action activity to our platform.\nOperator: We now turn to Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Congrats on the quarter. Mike, can you just talk about the international sort of underperformance, actually a really good quarter. Is there something just specific about the region in terms of how people are consuming over there versus the U.S.? Or is this just a maturation of your sales organization that needs to continue over in that region?\nMike Scarpelli: I think it's customers being a little more cautious in their business and just buying as they consume, which they can do under their contracts as well, too. We've always seen that in Japan, in particular. Customers tend to do that. But I would say part is also our own execution as well, too, which we're working on. So, yes, I will say, we did see as well in North America, a number of customers, some of our larger customers who had consumed their full contract amount but still had a contract in place and just bridge themselves rather than do big deals right now. And I think that's just a function of uncertainty in their business, but their consumption still continues to grow on stuff like it.\nKirk Materne: And just one quick one for Frank. Frank, on the telecom cloud that you guys have announced, I was just kind of curious your thoughts there, how fast do you think that could ramp? Obviously, financial services and some of the other verticals that you focused on been really strong to your point around some of the shared edges that you've seen in your bigger customers? Just any thoughts on how that could ramp for you guys?\nFrank Slootman: Telco is a really important segment for us. I mean, our largest customer -- some of our largest customers are in that segment. They're running massive amounts of data very focused on managing the service experience, cross-selling across very, very large customer bases. This is our fifth industry cloud that we have announced, and it's really focused on bringing telco-specific data sets, data assets to it, data practices, applications and then really bring in that ecosystem of telcos, people that interact with each other. We have the opportunity to have the benefit of a data network like Snowflake. So we're very high on -- I mean, obviously, telcos are the cornerstone of every modern economy, and especially in a lot of secondary markets, I mean, telcos tend to be the biggest consumers for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrent Thill: Just as it relates to the overall guide, can you just give us a little more color kind of what you baked in, Mike, and ultimately, perhaps kind of what's been the big change from your perspective?\nMike Scarpelli: The big change is really the -- we're seeing the younger cohorts that are coming into Snowflake are really ramping at a slower pace than what some of the early adopters of Snowflake did. They're still consuming. These tend to be large organizations as we've been focused on those large G2Ks, and they just move slowly, but they're still ramping their consumption just at a lower rate. And I think Snowflake is being deployed more efficiently for these customers. And I also just think too, as our base gets bigger that growth naturally slows down in the business, but customers are still consuming.\nBrent Thill: And just from a rep productivity perspective, Mike, is there anything changing there where you're seeing the reps productivity slow? Or is not consistent to what you've seen historically?\nMike Scarpelli: I would say we have a rep productivity issue in some of the international markets, and we are slowing down some of our hiring where we don't see the productivity, but there's other areas where productivity is doing well. The large enterprises is definitely doing well for us. North American enterprise continues to be strong for us. And we're going to deploy resources where we think we can get those reps productive over the next 12 months.\nOperator: We now turn to Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Deaton for Keith. You put up 158% net retention this quarter, which is still an impressive number, but slowing sequentially, I would love to understand what you're seeing between the different customer cores in terms of expansion momentum but also maybe optimization and how that sort of changed over the last 90 days. Any way you could sort of parse that out between 1 million plus customers and then the rest of your customers?\nMike Scarpelli: First of all, the 158% was the exact net revenue retention, just as a reminder, when we went public, and I think there was a little bit of a reacceleration in our business and 2021, 2022, where there's a lot of customers that maybe had spending out of control. Now that costs are a much bigger focus within almost every company today, I think people are using Snowflake more efficiently. Customers are having very detailed methodical deployment plans on Snowflake, which is slowing down that growth rate of customers' consumption as they're going through their implementations. But we're not seeing any customers decrease their spend in any material way in Snowflake. Yes, we still had those three we pointed out at the beginning of last year that a few of those have dropped out of our top 10, but those guys have stabilized. But in general, most of our customers continue to grow with us, albeit at a lower pace, and I think that's more of a nature of controlling costs.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Got it. And then just quickly on your verticalization. I mean clearly, that's a big focus for you. And I think the AWS partnership expansion sort of reiterates that effort. Any way you can sort of explain what you're seeing in different verticals? Are there any that slowed that are stabilizing now? Any that might be accelerating and sort of how you're thinking about different verticals when it comes to your fiscal year '24 guide?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I would say, as I mentioned in my remarks, and I've said before, financial services is definitely our biggest vertical. That's where we have the most data sharing going on. Next is media and technology, and entertainment. That's a huge segment for us. Clearly, some of the newer technology companies, we've seen a slowdown in some of those ones, which we had highlighted last year. And I do think you're definitely going to see a slowdown in a lot of the venture Mac companies that may have been growing very quickly. We're definitely seeing cost controls in those companies as well, but large Global 2000 continue to grow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.\nSean McMahon: This is Sean McMahon on for Raimo. You've recently discussed the top 15 GSIs have done around $1.4 billion in services spend around Snowflake and that was year-to-date as of Q3. I was wondering if we could get an update on that. And then how should we think about the attach to those service -- the attach of future consumption onto those services? Is there any framework we can think about to help inform next year's revenue expectations? For example, is there a correlation between the growth rates? Or can we think about the magnitude of that GSI spend with some sort of lag?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. I'll just say in the top 15 GSIs, the spend was -- in deals they've booked is over $1.6 billion last year based upon the data that my alliances team is reporting. In terms of trying to get any concrete relationship between their spend and Snowflake revenue, I really don't have that data and I would be guessing anecdotally looking at specific customers. So I'm not going to guide towards that. But it's generally a number of times bigger than what the revenue is associated with it in Year 1.\nSean McMahon: Got it. And a quick follow-up. How should we think about the relationship between operating margin and free cash flow margin going forward? Particularly when considering the increasing S&M leverage you guys are getting on larger accounts and the greater role of expansion revenue versus net new that may affect commissions? And then you mentioned there was some lower bookings duration, and I was wondering if billings duration played into that as well.\nMike Scarpelli: First of all, I don't even look at billings because in our model, people are just buying capacity and that capacity may be for three months, it could be for one month or could be for one year, and it really varies by customer, and they have the right to do that. In terms of relationship between operating margin and free cash flow, well, definitely as your operating margin expands, I expect our free cash flow to expand. But the operating margin will expand at a more rapid pace given it's a much lower number, and we will update the longer-term model as part of our Investor Day in June. We clearly just guided to 6% non-GAAP operating margin and 25% adjusted free cash flow for the full year this year.\nOperator: We now turn to Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Mike, you mentioned that weaker net new bookings and the slower-than-expected ramp from your youngest cohort impacted the fiscal '24 guide. But thinking back to the Q3 call, you had also spoken about some significant customers that you were expecting to materially ramp in fiscal '24. And you also said today that the enterprise has generally held up pretty well. So, I'm wondering, three months later, maybe looking at it from a bottoms-up perspective, can you share with us how you're thinking about these particular customers and the ones that there was this potential line of sight in terms of them ramping in fiscal '24. Just wondering if that's changed at all in terms of that viewpoint.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, those customers are definitely still ramping. But what I will say, what is different in literally Week 10 of our quarter, we converted 90% of our weighted pipeline into bookings where historically, that's been 140% in Q4, and that's typically because deals are understated and deals get pulled in. That did not happen this quarter. We also had a number of customers, big customers who rather than they consumed everything and rather than do a big multiyear deal, literally, just bought enough capacity to get them through to the next quarter or two. I do have two of my biggest customers. I know they run out of capacity within the next six months that they will have to do something. But once again, they could do big deals or they could just do buy a sufficient capacity on a quarterly basis because their contracts still haven't expired. They just don't have any capacity left on them. So that's why I don't focus too much on bookings and focus more on revenue and why I think that's the leading indicator. But as I said, we definitely do see a number of our newer customers in the cohort still ramping, but ramping at a slower pace than what historically they have. And I think that is a function of the cost controls that are going on within companies to make sure they are conserving as much money as they can from an expense standpoint.\nGregg Moskowitz: Very helpful. And then just for Mike and for Frank, on Snowpark for Python. So we've heard of a lot of customers that are kicking the tires, a lot of small tests that are taking place, but you did call out a couple of customers that are really ramping, and it sounds like there's a lot of robust POC activity. Just be helpful to get a little bit more insight in terms of how you're thinking about how this plays out over the course of fiscal '24 in terms of adoption.\nFrank Slootman: Well, we definitely have sort of unleashed a full court press because our basic posture is that, for example, any Spark job that runs in the Snowflake orbit, either putting data into Snowflake or taking data out of Snowflake, Snowpark for consumption, analytics, machine learning purposes is really ours. That's sort of the attitude that we take towards it, and we will we will challenge existing Spark chats, and we will compete hard for any new ones. So we are really taking ownership for the action activity that is happening in our hemisphere, so to speak. So it is all over the map. We can see very clearly from our own data, which customers are doing what because they're touching Snowflake. So we really mobilized ourselves as an organization to target that and you clearly seem to have picked up on a lot of the activity. It's a huge amount of stuff, and I feel it's really rolling out in ways, and there is a lot of POC activity going on there. These customers want to see whether we can verify some of the outcomes that we're anticipating. And so far, those results have been super encouraging and our sales force is pretty good about the opportunity based on the results that we're seeing. So we're quite excited about it. This is really -- the really the biggest expansion, if you will, of our scope as a company since we first came out in 2015 time frame when we went after Hadoop workloads and things of that sort.\nOperator: We now turn to Derrick Wood from Cowen. Your line is open.\nDerrick Wood: Frank, legacy migrations from on-premise have been a key growth driver for new customers for you guys. Is the macro causing any change in urgency for those kinds of migration projects? And given that you guys acquired SnowConvert, can you talk about how that may help simplify or accelerate migration projects?\nFrank Slootman: Well, on SnowConverts, I mean we've been working with that technology for years and years. We're super familiar with it. And we're actually really happy that we now have full control over that technology because it's not just about migrating customers, it's also getting them to consumption faster, which is why it matters to our model. Not really seeing a slowdown on migrations. I mean, all of Mike's comments so far is really about all the customers who are continuing to do contract extensions. They just have a more reticent posture. In the past, it was all about enabling growth as hard and as fast as they could because that was the dynamic of the time. Now, we're sort of in the opposite dynamic where they're looking to not get too far over their skis. And they're enabling the growth they are foreseeing and they're going a few steps at a time. But migrations are keep on coming fast and furious.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Mike, given all the headcount cuts happening in the tech sector, is that having any material impact to your assumptions around consumption activity. And you did allude to kind of the start-up tech seeing pressure. Any -- can you give us a sense for how much revenue exposure you have there?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. Well, first of all, when I make the comment about companies are definitely looking to save on their spend. When you're doing a RIF, you're generally not just looking at reducing costs and head count, you're also looking at other areas of your business you can reduce costs. So I definitely think in some customers, you can see one that publicly announced risks. We've seen some real slowdown in the revenue. Yet others -- I can't name their names, but there's another one that announced a RIF in one of our top 10 customers. Their consumption has actually gone up in Snowflake. So there's no direct correlation between RIFs and a customer's consumption in Snowflake. But I will say, CFOs and companies are definitely looking for ways to cut costs and either through headcount or other things.\nOperator: We now turn to Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAllan Verkhovski: This is Allan Verkhovski on for Alex Zukin. Just one quick one for me. For your 40% product growth guide in fiscal '24, how should we think about the seasonality through the year? And perhaps how has that changed relative to your view last quarter after now seeing slower ramp times with your more recent adopters of the platform?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, as I said, the more recent adopters of the platform we definitely see them ramping slower. They're taking longer in terms of they're not growing euphorically like some of the earlier ones. And I really do think that is a factor of -- it could be the macro that they want to conserve. It could be that they're depending on the customer, that they're being more efficient in how they roll Snowflake out as there's a bigger population of people who have been using Snowflake in the market. And it's also a factor that a lot of the new customers that we're signing up aren't necessarily these venture-backed start-ups that have unlimited capital. They tend to be more of these mature companies that have always been disciplined on their spending. So it really does vary. In terms of seasonality, we just guided for the quarter, you can see what we we guided. We guided 44% to 45% growth in Q1 and guided 40% to the year. I'm not going to give you the quarterly guidance for the other quarters because we'll give you Q2 after Q1 is finished as we've always done.\nOperator: Now turning to Sterling Auty from SVB. Your line is open.\nSterling Auty: Mike, you gave a couple of reasons for the slower growth in the newer customers. But I'm also wondering are new customers reducing the number of use cases initially? And if so, what are the use cases that you see them ramping with first? And what things maybe are they putting on hold?\nMike Scarpelli: There is no reduction in use cases. The use cases continue to expand. What are the most common use cases? It really depends. Migrations are a big one and on-prem, but it's an on-prem data warehouse, a lot of them. Some of them, though, are still -- we're still replacing some of those first-generation cloud data warehouses, I think, Redshift and things like that. I really haven't seen any slowdown in use cases. The average deal sizes remain relatively the same, hasn't changed.\nOperator: We now turn to Kamil Mielczarek from William Blair. Your line is open.\nKamil Mielczarek: Your free cash flow margin reached your long-term target of 25%. Can you provide a little more color around how you think about that shorter-term cash flow decision to balance margin and revenue growth? And assuming the macro environment improves later this year in fiscal '25, how do you think about bringing down margins to reaccelerate revenue?\nMike Scarpelli: Free cash flow margin is not directly related to our growth. Our growth is more on the expense side and looking at productivity, and will not grow our revenue faster unless we see productivity increase in the sales organization. And when we see that increase in productivity, we'll add more heads there, and we think we're adding at the appropriate pace based on what we're seeing in the business today. As I said, where most companies are cutting, we added 1,900 people last year, net, and we will add over 1,000 people this year while still generating improvement in operating margin and having very good free cash flow next year again.\nKamil Mielczarek: That's helpful. And a quick follow-up. I realize it's still early, but can you provide some detail around the traction you're seeing with the Unistore product and how you expect that piece of the platform to evolve for the next few years?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. This is Christian. It is, as you say, still very early on. We're selling in private preview with tens of customers validating a ring us feedback. We received quite positive feedback and encouragement, but it's early for us to have any meaningful rollout for adoption.\nOperator: We now turn to Fred Lee from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nFred Lee: You've both been very clear about managing the business for the long term and considering this operating philosophy, what's the thinking behind the $2 billion share buyback versus pouring more gas into the Company's R&D engine and doubling down on products?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes, Fred, it's Mike. We have $5.1 billion in cash on our balance sheet. We've had $5 billion since the time we went public. We've made a number of strategic acquisition and M&A deals. So, we feel we have more than enough capital in the business to fuel our growth through both the small tuck-in M&As as well as invest in headcount, but you can only add so many people at a time and get them productive in an engineering organization. And I'm not hearing our engineering leaders claim they need more people. And it's not growth at all costs this company. Yes, we are a growth company, but it's efficient growth as well too, and we'll continue to do that. And we expect we're going to generate close to $2 billion over the next two years. And given the $5.1 billion we have, we think it'd be great to manage dilution through that. And we still have the opportunity if we find great candidates to hire faster if we so choose.\nOperator: We now turn to Brad Reback from Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Mike, over the last three years, you've added 1,800 to 1,900 new customers each year. So as we look into '24, should we expect that to continue in a similar sort of growth in revenue per customer? Or will it skew more towards revenue per customer?\nMike Scarpelli: First of all, I don't really focus on the total number of customers. As I've said many times, I'd like to focus on quality customers. We tend to focus on large enterprise or they can be small that have the ability to be significant customers. And so clearly, the number of customers is going to grow. Whether we add 1,800, 2,000 or 1,500, I really don't know next year. I'm going to focus more on what those right customers are. And you will see the revenue per customer growing. Yes, our 1 million-plus customers have stayed flat at 3.7 million, but we also added a number of new customers in there. Our Global 2000 now are up to 1.4 million in trailing 12 months. They were at 1.3 million last quarter, yet we still added more Global 2000. So I do think the revenue per million over plus customer and G2K is going to continue to grow over time, and I think you're going to see more growth out of those Global 2000 numbers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Frank, 20% of customers have tried Snowpark Python. When do you think that those use cases and workloads could actually move from testing and experimentation actually driving acceleration in the business. Do you think this is a potential lever in the second half? Or do you think it take a year for a lot of these customers to work out some of these new use cases from a workload driver perspective?\nFrank Slootman: Yes, in terms of what we're already seeing in the velocity of consumption that is coming from Snowpark, we think it will be in the second half at some point, where we're going to see what we think is a material impact from that. But it's still early days. We're growing from a very small base. So yes, we are seeing high velocity that still need to persist before on our revenue scale, it becomes material.\nMike Scarpelli: Another way, Brent, our guidance for this year is not material what we have for Snowpark, but I do think longer term will be much more materially. It could give us upside, but it's still too early.\nBrent Bracelin: Very helpful. And then, Mike, I want to go back to the margin comment here. I guess recession impacting a drag on the growth business for 100% usage model, but you are guiding a 25% free cash flow margins at, call it, $2.5 billion scale. Are you rethinking the profitability of this business at $10 billion scale, just thinking through margins today and what they potentially could be at much larger scale.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, you're just going to have to wait for June or Investor Day when we give an update on that model but clearly, there's upside to what we said last Investor Day.\nOperator: We now turn to Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Yes, Mike, going back to your comments on the bookings slowdown at the end of the quarter, how much of that was driving the lower outlook for the full year versus actual consumption slowdown that you saw? And I guess, secondly, as you think about that booking slowdown, are you incorporating lower close rate assumptions just given that this was the first quarter that you converted below 100% of the weighted adjusted pipeline?\nMike Scarpelli: Most of that bookings was really just a duration customers buying enough capacity to get them through. Yes, there were customers that we did not land some new ones that have deferred into this year to do deals that does have an impact in the second half of the year on revenue. But the biggest thing on the revenue guide is really we are seeing the newer customers take longer to ramp. And these are some of our big customers that are large Global 2000 that are very methodical in the way they do things. Unlike some of the early adopters that were do everything as possible to get everything on Snowflake as soon as possible.\nOperator: We're now turning to Simon Leopold from Raymond James.\nVictor Chiu: This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. Regarding the behavior of the new cohorts, do you anticipate that consumption accelerates and returns to previous consumption rates in a more normalized environment? Or is this a structural shift around how new cohorts are kind of approaching their implementations, and this is how we should think about it as kind of the status quo going forward?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, what I would say is we're in a consumption model that literally the beginning of the day, we have zero revenue and customers choose to use Snowflake. In a tight macro environment, I think people are watching their costs. But just as quickly as they can turn Snowflake off, they can ramp it up very quickly as well, too. And so we're seeing a customers, as I said before, use Snowflake more efficiently, be more methodical in how they roll Snowflake out to make sure they're doing things. But there's really no big change. Customers are still consuming. They're just not growing at the rate they were, they're still growing. And you see that in our net revenue retention.\nVictor Chiu: Okay. That's helpful. And just one quick follow-up. Can you help us understand a little more around your R&D priorities? Maybe help us understand where your preferences are between adding new features versus entering new markets? Just trying to get a sense for where you see opportunities around your R&D efforts.\nMike Scarpelli: I'll let Christian talk about that.\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. We continue investing and innovating across the three broad vectors that we discussed in the past. One is continued progress on analytics. Second one is around collaboration, where data sharing cleanest. Here, one is the broader category of who's not enablement, but we've seen computation to come closer to the data, that's where Snow are extremely and many of our initiatives fit in. So we continue investing and making progress now three prongs.\nMike Scarpelli: And on the product side or in market side, we will have FedRAMP high very, very soon that the public sector, we're going to be able to go after and as well, we're working on our side, and expect we'll have the public sector will start to be more material to us this year in terms of new deals. And in terms of new markets, we continue to explore China with a strategy for our global multinationals who operate in China, and that is something where we will be in there this year. And then the other thing that I would say, too, is we're not opening any new countries, and we're going to invest more in some of the bigger international markets like Japan where we're seeing huge opportunity. They just move slower.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Will Power from Baird. Your line is open.\nWill Power: Okay. Great. It looks like a really nice comprehensive agreement with AWS. I guess I wonder in that vein, if you could provide any update as to the Azure relationship, the opportunity there, what go-to-market currently looks like? And then Mike, just as it pertains to margins this year, margin guidance a bit higher than where you were previously despite the lower revenue outlook. Just maybe any other color on kind of the key levers helping enable that.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I'll start with the margins first. Clearly, when we, like many of our customers started looking at our costs, and we slowed down some of our hiring this year. And so that's really driving the margin outperformance as well as efficiencies in the way we do things. And we are committed to continuing to operate the Company as efficiently as possible. So do expect longer term more leverage in the model there. In terms of the relationship with the cloud vendors, I would say, the new AWS agreement is a great step forward in improving an already really good relationship with AWS to begin with. We had a $1.2 billion commit. Now we have a $2.5 billion commit over the next five years, and it's much better alignment go-to-market between the two. AWS, we're still -- I mean Azure, we're still 2.5 years into that five-year contract. We will start discussing with Azure trying to get better terms. I'm not just talking pricing, I'm talking go-to-market working together with one another, and there's no change in GCP to date. I'm hopeful there could be something in GCP longer term. We will come to the end of our GCP contract in May of 2024. And we're tracking to fully consume what we committed to with GCP, but we're clearly running ahead with Azure and AWS, and that's why we did an early renewal or a new contract with AWS.\nOperator: We now turn to Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Your line is open.\nFred Havemeyer: Mike, I wanted to go back to an earlier comment you made about some of your newer customer cohorts being more methodical in their approach to ramping on Snowflake. Could you provide a little more context around what you're seeing there in terms of what they're doing? Is this something around the -- perhaps like anything budget-related oversight, internal change management or anything? And I'm trying to square that also or not square it rather, but understand it in context with the description you gave that the enterprise segment is performing quite well.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I'm just telling you they're not growing as quickly as what they did, but we saw in 2021 and 2022, where I think it was a little bit more you or with companies who didn't have as much cost discipline around spending, and you're seeing people being more cost conscious and how they do things across the board, not just on Snowflake, that's why you're seeing these companies do rips out there. And as a result, we do see these companies growing, albeit they're growing at a more methodical pace. We're not seeing these crazy spikes in consumption in customers. And that's also a function of people are using Snowflake more efficiently in terms of really planning out the rollout of Snowflake, also our PS resource since they're actively involved with customers. Our partners are getting better trained on how to do Snowflake migrations. This just -- this is really a maturing of our partner ecosystem and us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMike Scarpelli: I can't hear you. Can you repeat that? Even with -- sorry, can you start to be in?\nMichael Turrin: Yes. Yes. No, happy to. But even with some of the impacts you're mentioning, the NRR is still holding strong at 18% not lost on us, but any change in how you're thinking about target levels realize there's variability that you said you expect those to remain above 130% for a long time. Just anything you're seeing currently that could cause that metric to dip more meaningfully or anything you can add there is helpful.\nMike Scarpelli: We're not forecasting it to dip to that level anytime soon. But clearly, as the numbers get bigger, it becomes harder. And that number is still going to be a very high number. And it really all depends upon the customers we land today and the ones that we landed over the last two years that will come into our cohort next year. But clearly, if you recall back in 2020, we actually had an acceleration in our net revenue retention rate. I'm not saying that's going to happen, but that is possible that, that could happen as well, too. You look through 2022, our net revenue retention went up. And that's the beautiful thing of a consumption model. Just as companies can really control their spend on Snowflake, when they open up their budgets more, they can ramp very quickly existing customers on Snowflake that could drive that up, but we're not seeing a precipitous drop off longer term in the net revenue retention. It will potentially come down longer term, but it's going to still stay very high. Sorry I can't hear you.\nMichael Turrin: Helpful. Just one more, if I may. Sorry -- that's helpful. Any -- you've mentioned the new customers ramping slower. I think we can appreciate the environment we're in. But is -- are there things you're contemplating either from a product or go-to-market perspective that could change that dynamic at all? Or is it more a matter of being patient, letting them come to you and this all leads us out over time from your perspective?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. I also want to stress too, that's on average, there are some customers who are ramping very, very quickly. But that was the whole strategy behind the SnowConvert acquisition of Mobileye. That's really to help enable migrations faster. That's also why we are spending a lot of time certifying and training our partners so they can work on this. We are doing everything we can to continue to see customers ramp on Snowflake. And to be clear, they continue to ramp at a very good pace, albeit not at the euphoric pace that they were in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nMichael Cikos: I wanted to see if I could parse back the guidance construction that you guys have. I know a couple of other folks have added -- asked about maybe total customer ads. And I know, Mike, you had commented that you guys are looking to focus on the quality customers. If I just look at like the Global 2000 as an example, I think previously, Snowflake has spoken about having, call it, one- to two-year sales cycles for some of these customers, again, because it's a strategic relationship. Is there any way or can you provide any detail as far as how you're thinking about additions from the Global 2000? Or how those net retention rates are expected to trend over the course of the year? And then one follow-up, if I could, I know an earlier colleague get asked about the Company's exposure to let's say that the more VC-backed companies, which are clamping down versus the four growth that you had seen previously. Can you size up what that exposure is to that customer segment?\nMike Scarpelli: So you asked a number of questions. But the first thing is we land large enterprises, Global 2000 as fast as we can. They are large long sales cycles. They will be lumpy in terms of when we land them, but that is purely the booking. The ramping of those guys take time and it's to get them to ramp to revenue. We have not seen any change in terms of really the average deal size of those Global 2000 when we land them. In terms of net revenue retention you asked about, I'm not going to guide to net revenue retention in the future. And in terms of your question on venture-backed companies, we have disclosed this before, and it remains there. It's roughly 10% of our business. That tends to be the segment that our inside sales really focuses on, not all of that, and there are some large companies in there as well, too. These are some of the unicorns that have been ready to go public for a while, but given the markets have chosen not to. But when I look at those large unicorns, they're still very well capitalized.\nMichael Cikos: That's awesome. And I know that you're saying that there's no change in the average deal size from when you're landing these customers, but you are saying that the newer cohorts are are expanding at a slower rate. Can you provide like magnitude of differences, if customers have typically taken, I don't know, six months to ramp to the run rate, how is that trending today? Like what would that delta be if we're thinking about magnitude based on this macro impact you're seeing?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes, I'm not going to disclose that. I'm just saying it's slower.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Dan on for Brad. I just wanted to ask one quickly on some of the hardware and software improvements that were kind of a key focus going into the year. And now that we've kind of gone through the year and you mentioned the Graviton migration is completed, how did those kind of play out the impact of that on consumption relative to kind of what you're expecting? And then anything to kind of call out looking into next year, over the next several quarters in terms of hardware, software improvements and any reason that would kind of differ from kind of the long-term impact that you expect those to have that you've talked about before?\nMike Scarpelli: No. As I said before, we factor in a 5% revenue headwind every year associated with both hardware and software improvements, and don't see any material hardware improvements happening. This year, as of today, there are a number of software improvements that we're constantly working on those. And so I feel pretty good about that 5%, as I mentioned. The Graviton2 deployments are all completed as of today. We didn't quite get them all done last year. There were a number of them were finished in the first month of this quarter. And so didn't quite have the full impact as we thought last year, but it's really hard to tell, but it's baked into our forecast for this year.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then just one last one. I was just curious on the international, if there are any markets in particular that kind of drove the underperformance in international?\nMike Scarpelli: So EMEA actually had a good consumption. They were pretty much on plan from a consumption. They were a little slower on the booking side. And I think that's more of a function of people being more cautious with uncertainty in their businesses. I would say, Japan is doing well for us, but they are very methodical and buy as they go. And I would say some of the other areas in Asia are a little bit slower, but Asia is such a small piece of our overall business. It's really EMEA that was a little slower than what we would have thought from a bookings perspective and productivity.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, today's call has now concluded.

            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks Jimmy. Good afternoon, everybody on the call. Q4 product revenue grew 54% year-on-year and for the fiscal year grew 70%, totaling $1.9 billion. Q4 net revenue retention was 158%. We continue to be on track for our $10 billion product revenue goal in fiscal '29. Remaining performance obligations grew 38% totaling $3.7 billion. We saw a measure of bookings renaissance with certain customer segments in Q4 reflecting a lack of visibility in the business and preferring a cautious short-term stance versus larger, longer term contract expansions. The contractual poster focused on sufficiently enabling consumption growth in the near term. This was more pronounced among international SMB and commercial customers and much less so at the high end of our customer base. We made substantial progress on our efficiency metrics. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter reached 6%. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin for the quarter was 37%. For the full fiscal year '23, non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 25%, totaling $120 million. But our data networking growth as measured by so-called stable edges grew 93% year-over-year. 23% of our customers now have at least one stable edge, up from 18% a year ago. Among $1 million consumption customers, 65% of them at, on average, six stable edges. Snowflake marketplace listings grew 8% quarter-over-quarter and now total over 1,500. During Q4, Snowpark for Python reached general availability status. Early traction is promising. 20% of customers have now tried Snowpark. Snowpark is initially focused on the adoption and migration of Spark workloads for data engineering and machine learning. Spark jobs typically are on cheaper and faster on Snowpark with the added benefits of superior governance and operational simplicity. POC activity is ramping fast and benchmark results so far indicate superior comparative results. The Fortune 500 customer loads 1 billion transaction records into Snowflake every day. This organization take $1 million after migrating work from Spark to Snowpark. The financial services customer is migrating workloads from Spark to Snowflake and Snowpark rent 8x faster at 30% of the cost. We entered private preview standards with what we call Streamlit and Snowflake. This is the replatforming of Streamlit inside of Snowflake. Streamlit is a popular application development framework for the Python developer community, especially those focused on machine learning applications. Streamlit enables the use of machine learning models and applications by a general business audience. In Q4, we announced our intent to acquire Mobileye net SnowConvert. SnowConvert's proprietary conversion tools enable migration from legacy platforms. SnowConvert also helps migrate Spark workloads to Snowpark, capabilities accelerate migration to Snowflake and the strategic nature of this acquisition. We are operating in a vast and growing market, generating free cash flow and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We focus on the business' hand and the outcomes we can control. We are prioritizing positions that directly support the core mission of the enterprise. Resources will continue to be concentrated on the roles that sell, support and build our products. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Well, it's still early in the cycle. Obviously, like everybody else, we're all over it in terms of evaluating where these technologies can make a difference. I mean the things that we sort of hone in on short term, is called completion code optimizations, things that are very, very clear business returns. One of the challenges with these new technologies that people come up with a lot of interesting questions, but without a solid business model that's not going to take off. So we take a very pragmatic view. We do anticipate that Snowflake data will be a very, very big driver of large language model in conjunction with many, many other data sources. So we think that the gravity around data will drive a lot of this action activity to our platform. Telco is a really important segment for us. I mean, our largest customer -- some of our largest customers are in that segment. They're running massive amounts of data very focused on managing the service experience, cross-selling across very, very large customer bases. This is our fifth industry cloud that we have announced, and it's really focused on bringing telco-specific data sets, data assets to it, data practices, applications and then really bring in that ecosystem of telcos, people that interact with each other. We have the opportunity to have the benefit of a data network like Snowflake. So we're very high on -- I mean, obviously, telcos are the cornerstone of every modern economy, and especially in a lot of secondary markets, I mean, telcos tend to be the biggest consumers for us. Well, we definitely have sort of unleashed a full court press because our basic posture is that, for example, any Spark job that runs in the Snowflake orbit, either putting data into Snowflake or taking data out of Snowflake, Snowpark for consumption, analytics, machine learning purposes is really ours. That's sort of the attitude that we take towards it, and we will we will challenge existing Spark chats, and we will compete hard for any new ones. So we are really taking ownership for the action activity that is happening in our hemisphere, so to speak. So it is all over the map. We can see very clearly from our own data, which customers are doing what because they're touching Snowflake. So we really mobilized ourselves as an organization to target that and you clearly seem to have picked up on a lot of the activity. It's a huge amount of stuff, and I feel it's really rolling out in ways, and there is a lot of POC activity going on there. These customers want to see whether we can verify some of the outcomes that we're anticipating. And so far, those results have been super encouraging and our sales force is pretty good about the opportunity based on the results that we're seeing. So we're quite excited about it. This is really -- the really the biggest expansion, if you will, of our scope as a company since we first came out in 2015 time frame when we went after Hadoop workloads and things of that sort. Well, on SnowConverts, I mean we've been working with that technology for years and years. We're super familiar with it. And we're actually really happy that we now have full control over that technology because it's not just about migrating customers, it's also getting them to consumption faster, which is why it matters to our model. Not really seeing a slowdown on migrations. I mean, all of Mike's comments so far is really about all the customers who are continuing to do contract extensions. They just have a more reticent posture. In the past, it was all about enabling growth as hard and as fast as they could because that was the dynamic of the time. Now, we're sort of in the opposite dynamic where they're looking to not get too far over their skis. And they're enabling the growth they are foreseeing and they're going a few steps at a time. But migrations are keep on coming fast and furious. Yes, in terms of what we're already seeing in the velocity of consumption that is coming from Snowpark, we think it will be in the second half at some point, where we're going to see what we think is a material impact from that. But it's still early days. We're growing from a very small base. So yes, we are seeing high velocity that still need to persist before on our revenue scale, it becomes material."

            "name": "Mike Scarpelli",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Q4 product revenues were $555 million, representing 54% year-over-year growth and remaining performance obligations grew 38% year-over-year, totaling $3.7 billion. Of the $3.7 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. This represents a 48% increase compared to our estimate as of the same quarter last year. Our net revenue retention rate of 158% includes 13 new customers with $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue and reflects durable growth among our largest customers. The outperformance in Q4 was driven by longest tenured customers. We continue to see the greatest contribution from the financial services and media and entertainment verticals. We continue to focus on growth and efficiency. We generated $215 million in non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow outperforming our Q4 target. Full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 25%. Q4 bookings underperformed versus our expectations, pipeline conversion in the final two weeks of the quarter diverged from historical norms. International territories drove the largest underperformance relative to plan and multiyear bookings declined 15% year-on-year. While we are not okay with this outcome, customers' bookings behavior does not dictate their consumption patterns. Customers have the contractual right to sign smaller deals to bridge them to their contract end date. We are confident that our customers are committed to Snowflake and are increasingly focused on better managing their business during more uncertain times. Q4 represented another quarter of continued progress on profitability. Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 75% scale in our public cloud data centers continue growth in large customers' accounts in more favorable pricing with our cloud service providers will contribute to year-over-year gross margins improvements. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and savings on T&E and lower bad debt expense. Our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 37%, positively impacted by strong collections. We received some large customer payments in January that were expected in February. We ended the quarter in a strong cash position with $5.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments with no debt. As noted in the press release that went out earlier today, we have expanded our partnership with AWS over the next five years more than doubling our previous spend commitments to $2.5 billion. As part of the new AWS -- as part of the new agreement, AWS is committing to support joint go-to-market efforts, more favorable pricing. This partnership is aimed at driving growth in innovation. Now let's turn to our guidance. As of today, we have completed the Graviton2 migration in all of our active commercial AWS deployments. We remain committed to driving towards greater profitability. We are focused on growing revenue while expanding operating and free cash flow margins. The change in existing customer purchasing behavior, lower-than-expected new logo bookings and slower expected ramp from our youngest cohorts has led us to reevaluate our FY '24 outlook. For the first quarter, we expect product revenues between $568 million and $573 million, representing year-over-year growth between 44% and 45%. Turning to margins. We expect on a non-GAAP basis, 0% operating margin, and we expect 361 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2024, we expect product revenues of approximately $2.7 billion representing year-over-year growth of approximately 40%. Turning to profitability for the full year fiscal 2024, we expect on a non-GAAP basis, approximately 76% product gross margin, 6% operating margin and 25% adjusted free cash flow margin, and we expect 363 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. I would also like to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $2 billion over the next two years. This program reflects our conviction in the business and allows us to use our expected free cash flow to manage dilution over this period. Our share count guidance does not include the impact from the stock repurchase. During fiscal 2023, we added approximately 1,900 net new employees. We view the current hiring market as favorable for Snowflake and we'll continue to prioritize hiring in product, engineering and sales. We expect to add more than 1,000 employees in fiscal 2024. We remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029, $10 billion product revenue target. We look forward to executing against our growing opportunity. And lastly, we will host our Investor Day on June 27 in Las Vegas in conjunction with Snowflake Summit, our annual users' conference. If you're interested in attending, please e-mail ir@snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. There was nothing really noteworthy around the holidays. As we said, going into our Q4 guidance, we are factoring in the holidays. And clearly, we were 3% above our guidance, our actual results. And I will say President's Day was slow, but February is off to a very good start. It's kind of where we were expecting it to be. I think it's customers being a little more cautious in their business and just buying as they consume, which they can do under their contracts as well, too. We've always seen that in Japan, in particular. Customers tend to do that. But I would say part is also our own execution as well, too, which we're working on. So, yes, I will say, we did see as well in North America, a number of customers, some of our larger customers who had consumed their full contract amount but still had a contract in place and just bridge themselves rather than do big deals right now. And I think that's just a function of uncertainty in their business, but their consumption still continues to grow on stuff like it. The big change is really the -- we're seeing the younger cohorts that are coming into Snowflake are really ramping at a slower pace than what some of the early adopters of Snowflake did. They're still consuming. These tend to be large organizations as we've been focused on those large G2Ks, and they just move slowly, but they're still ramping their consumption just at a lower rate. And I think Snowflake is being deployed more efficiently for these customers. And I also just think too, as our base gets bigger that growth naturally slows down in the business, but customers are still consuming. I would say we have a rep productivity issue in some of the international markets, and we are slowing down some of our hiring where we don't see the productivity, but there's other areas where productivity is doing well. The large enterprises is definitely doing well for us. North American enterprise continues to be strong for us. And we're going to deploy resources where we think we can get those reps productive over the next 12 months. First of all, the 158% was the exact net revenue retention, just as a reminder, when we went public, and I think there was a little bit of a reacceleration in our business and 2021, 2022, where there's a lot of customers that maybe had spending out of control. Now that costs are a much bigger focus within almost every company today, I think people are using Snowflake more efficiently. Customers are having very detailed methodical deployment plans on Snowflake, which is slowing down that growth rate of customers' consumption as they're going through their implementations. But we're not seeing any customers decrease their spend in any material way in Snowflake. Yes, we still had those three we pointed out at the beginning of last year that a few of those have dropped out of our top 10, but those guys have stabilized. But in general, most of our customers continue to grow with us, albeit at a lower pace, and I think that's more of a nature of controlling costs. Well, I would say, as I mentioned in my remarks, and I've said before, financial services is definitely our biggest vertical. That's where we have the most data sharing going on. Next is media and technology, and entertainment. That's a huge segment for us. Clearly, some of the newer technology companies, we've seen a slowdown in some of those ones, which we had highlighted last year. And I do think you're definitely going to see a slowdown in a lot of the venture Mac companies that may have been growing very quickly. We're definitely seeing cost controls in those companies as well, but large Global 2000 continue to grow. Yes. I'll just say in the top 15 GSIs, the spend was -- in deals they've booked is over $1.6 billion last year based upon the data that my alliances team is reporting. In terms of trying to get any concrete relationship between their spend and Snowflake revenue, I really don't have that data and I would be guessing anecdotally looking at specific customers. So I'm not going to guide towards that. But it's generally a number of times bigger than what the revenue is associated with it in Year 1. First of all, I don't even look at billings because in our model, people are just buying capacity and that capacity may be for three months, it could be for one month or could be for one year, and it really varies by customer, and they have the right to do that. In terms of relationship between operating margin and free cash flow, well, definitely as your operating margin expands, I expect our free cash flow to expand. But the operating margin will expand at a more rapid pace given it's a much lower number, and we will update the longer-term model as part of our Investor Day in June. We clearly just guided to 6% non-GAAP operating margin and 25% adjusted free cash flow for the full year this year. Well, those customers are definitely still ramping. But what I will say, what is different in literally Week 10 of our quarter, we converted 90% of our weighted pipeline into bookings where historically, that's been 140% in Q4, and that's typically because deals are understated and deals get pulled in. That did not happen this quarter. We also had a number of customers, big customers who rather than they consumed everything and rather than do a big multiyear deal, literally, just bought enough capacity to get them through to the next quarter or two. I do have two of my biggest customers. I know they run out of capacity within the next six months that they will have to do something. But once again, they could do big deals or they could just do buy a sufficient capacity on a quarterly basis because their contracts still haven't expired. They just don't have any capacity left on them. So that's why I don't focus too much on bookings and focus more on revenue and why I think that's the leading indicator. But as I said, we definitely do see a number of our newer customers in the cohort still ramping, but ramping at a slower pace than what historically they have. And I think that is a function of the cost controls that are going on within companies to make sure they are conserving as much money as they can from an expense standpoint. Yes. Well, first of all, when I make the comment about companies are definitely looking to save on their spend. When you're doing a RIF, you're generally not just looking at reducing costs and head count, you're also looking at other areas of your business you can reduce costs. So I definitely think in some customers, you can see one that publicly announced risks. We've seen some real slowdown in the revenue. Yet others -- I can't name their names, but there's another one that announced a RIF in one of our top 10 customers. Their consumption has actually gone up in Snowflake. So there's no direct correlation between RIFs and a customer's consumption in Snowflake. But I will say, CFOs and companies are definitely looking for ways to cut costs and either through headcount or other things. Well, as I said, the more recent adopters of the platform we definitely see them ramping slower. They're taking longer in terms of they're not growing euphorically like some of the earlier ones. And I really do think that is a factor of -- it could be the macro that they want to conserve. It could be that they're depending on the customer, that they're being more efficient in how they roll Snowflake out as there's a bigger population of people who have been using Snowflake in the market. And it's also a factor that a lot of the new customers that we're signing up aren't necessarily these venture-backed start-ups that have unlimited capital. They tend to be more of these mature companies that have always been disciplined on their spending. So it really does vary. In terms of seasonality, we just guided for the quarter, you can see what we we guided. We guided 44% to 45% growth in Q1 and guided 40% to the year. I'm not going to give you the quarterly guidance for the other quarters because we'll give you Q2 after Q1 is finished as we've always done. There is no reduction in use cases. The use cases continue to expand. What are the most common use cases? It really depends. Migrations are a big one and on-prem, but it's an on-prem data warehouse, a lot of them. Some of them, though, are still -- we're still replacing some of those first-generation cloud data warehouses, I think, Redshift and things like that. I really haven't seen any slowdown in use cases. The average deal sizes remain relatively the same, hasn't changed. Free cash flow margin is not directly related to our growth. Our growth is more on the expense side and looking at productivity, and will not grow our revenue faster unless we see productivity increase in the sales organization. And when we see that increase in productivity, we'll add more heads there, and we think we're adding at the appropriate pace based on what we're seeing in the business today. As I said, where most companies are cutting, we added 1,900 people last year, net, and we will add over 1,000 people this year while still generating improvement in operating margin and having very good free cash flow next year again. Yes, Fred, it's Mike. We have $5.1 billion in cash on our balance sheet. We've had $5 billion since the time we went public. We've made a number of strategic acquisition and M&A deals. So, we feel we have more than enough capital in the business to fuel our growth through both the small tuck-in M&As as well as invest in headcount, but you can only add so many people at a time and get them productive in an engineering organization. And I'm not hearing our engineering leaders claim they need more people. And it's not growth at all costs this company. Yes, we are a growth company, but it's efficient growth as well too, and we'll continue to do that. And we expect we're going to generate close to $2 billion over the next two years. And given the $5.1 billion we have, we think it'd be great to manage dilution through that. And we still have the opportunity if we find great candidates to hire faster if we so choose. First of all, I don't really focus on the total number of customers. As I've said many times, I'd like to focus on quality customers. We tend to focus on large enterprise or they can be small that have the ability to be significant customers. And so clearly, the number of customers is going to grow. Whether we add 1,800, 2,000 or 1,500, I really don't know next year. I'm going to focus more on what those right customers are. And you will see the revenue per customer growing. Yes, our 1 million-plus customers have stayed flat at 3.7 million, but we also added a number of new customers in there. Our Global 2000 now are up to 1.4 million in trailing 12 months. They were at 1.3 million last quarter, yet we still added more Global 2000. So I do think the revenue per million over plus customer and G2K is going to continue to grow over time, and I think you're going to see more growth out of those Global 2000 numbers. Another way, Brent, our guidance for this year is not material what we have for Snowpark, but I do think longer term will be much more materially. It could give us upside, but it's still too early. Well, you're just going to have to wait for June or Investor Day when we give an update on that model but clearly, there's upside to what we said last Investor Day. Most of that bookings was really just a duration customers buying enough capacity to get them through. Yes, there were customers that we did not land some new ones that have deferred into this year to do deals that does have an impact in the second half of the year on revenue. But the biggest thing on the revenue guide is really we are seeing the newer customers take longer to ramp. And these are some of our big customers that are large Global 2000 that are very methodical in the way they do things. Unlike some of the early adopters that were do everything as possible to get everything on Snowflake as soon as possible. Well, what I would say is we're in a consumption model that literally the beginning of the day, we have zero revenue and customers choose to use Snowflake. In a tight macro environment, I think people are watching their costs. But just as quickly as they can turn Snowflake off, they can ramp it up very quickly as well, too. And so we're seeing a customers, as I said before, use Snowflake more efficiently, be more methodical in how they roll Snowflake out to make sure they're doing things. But there's really no big change. Customers are still consuming. They're just not growing at the rate they were, they're still growing. And you see that in our net revenue retention. I'll let Christian talk about that. And on the product side or in market side, we will have FedRAMP high very, very soon that the public sector, we're going to be able to go after and as well, we're working on our side, and expect we'll have the public sector will start to be more material to us this year in terms of new deals. And in terms of new markets, we continue to explore China with a strategy for our global multinationals who operate in China, and that is something where we will be in there this year. And then the other thing that I would say, too, is we're not opening any new countries, and we're going to invest more in some of the bigger international markets like Japan where we're seeing huge opportunity. They just move slower. Well, I'll start with the margins first. Clearly, when we, like many of our customers started looking at our costs, and we slowed down some of our hiring this year. And so that's really driving the margin outperformance as well as efficiencies in the way we do things. And we are committed to continuing to operate the Company as efficiently as possible. So do expect longer term more leverage in the model there. In terms of the relationship with the cloud vendors, I would say, the new AWS agreement is a great step forward in improving an already really good relationship with AWS to begin with. We had a $1.2 billion commit. Now we have a $2.5 billion commit over the next five years, and it's much better alignment go-to-market between the two. AWS, we're still -- I mean Azure, we're still 2.5 years into that five-year contract. We will start discussing with Azure trying to get better terms. I'm not just talking pricing, I'm talking go-to-market working together with one another, and there's no change in GCP to date. I'm hopeful there could be something in GCP longer term. We will come to the end of our GCP contract in May of 2024. And we're tracking to fully consume what we committed to with GCP, but we're clearly running ahead with Azure and AWS, and that's why we did an early renewal or a new contract with AWS. Well, I'm just telling you they're not growing as quickly as what they did, but we saw in 2021 and 2022, where I think it was a little bit more you or with companies who didn't have as much cost discipline around spending, and you're seeing people being more cost conscious and how they do things across the board, not just on Snowflake, that's why you're seeing these companies do rips out there. And as a result, we do see these companies growing, albeit they're growing at a more methodical pace. We're not seeing these crazy spikes in consumption in customers. And that's also a function of people are using Snowflake more efficiently in terms of really planning out the rollout of Snowflake, also our PS resource since they're actively involved with customers. Our partners are getting better trained on how to do Snowflake migrations. This just -- this is really a maturing of our partner ecosystem and us. I can't hear you. Can you repeat that? Even with -- sorry, can you start to be in? We're not forecasting it to dip to that level anytime soon. But clearly, as the numbers get bigger, it becomes harder. And that number is still going to be a very high number. And it really all depends upon the customers we land today and the ones that we landed over the last two years that will come into our cohort next year. But clearly, if you recall back in 2020, we actually had an acceleration in our net revenue retention rate. I'm not saying that's going to happen, but that is possible that, that could happen as well, too. You look through 2022, our net revenue retention went up. And that's the beautiful thing of a consumption model. Just as companies can really control their spend on Snowflake, when they open up their budgets more, they can ramp very quickly existing customers on Snowflake that could drive that up, but we're not seeing a precipitous drop off longer term in the net revenue retention. It will potentially come down longer term, but it's going to still stay very high. Sorry I can't hear you. Yes. I also want to stress too, that's on average, there are some customers who are ramping very, very quickly. But that was the whole strategy behind the SnowConvert acquisition of Mobileye. That's really to help enable migrations faster. That's also why we are spending a lot of time certifying and training our partners so they can work on this. We are doing everything we can to continue to see customers ramp on Snowflake. And to be clear, they continue to ramp at a very good pace, albeit not at the euphoric pace that they were in the past. So you asked a number of questions. But the first thing is we land large enterprises, Global 2000 as fast as we can. They are large long sales cycles. They will be lumpy in terms of when we land them, but that is purely the booking. The ramping of those guys take time and it's to get them to ramp to revenue. We have not seen any change in terms of really the average deal size of those Global 2000 when we land them. In terms of net revenue retention you asked about, I'm not going to guide to net revenue retention in the future. And in terms of your question on venture-backed companies, we have disclosed this before, and it remains there. It's roughly 10% of our business. That tends to be the segment that our inside sales really focuses on, not all of that, and there are some large companies in there as well, too. These are some of the unicorns that have been ready to go public for a while, but given the markets have chosen not to. But when I look at those large unicorns, they're still very well capitalized. Yes, I'm not going to disclose that. I'm just saying it's slower. No. As I said before, we factor in a 5% revenue headwind every year associated with both hardware and software improvements, and don't see any material hardware improvements happening. This year, as of today, there are a number of software improvements that we're constantly working on those. And so I feel pretty good about that 5%, as I mentioned. The Graviton2 deployments are all completed as of today. We didn't quite get them all done last year. There were a number of them were finished in the first month of this quarter. And so didn't quite have the full impact as we thought last year, but it's really hard to tell, but it's baked into our forecast for this year. So EMEA actually had a good consumption. They were pretty much on plan from a consumption. They were a little slower on the booking side. And I think that's more of a function of people being more cautious with uncertainty in their businesses. I would say, Japan is doing well for us, but they are very methodical and buy as they go. And I would say some of the other areas in Asia are a little bit slower, but Asia is such a small piece of our overall business. It's really EMEA that was a little slower than what we would have thought from a bookings perspective and productivity."

Snowflake continues to drive strong growth at scale, coupled with strengthened unit economics, operating profit and free cash flow. While we acknowledge the weakening global macro context, we remain resilient in terms of our results. We believe this resilience reflects the importance of data strategy in modern enterprises and institutions. Data is becoming deeply ingrained in how global enterprises think, act, decide and strategize. Relying on anecdotal observations will increasingly take a back seat to data-driven operations.  The company is reporting $523 million in product revenue, growing 67% year-on-year. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 66% year-on-year to $3 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, product gross margin came in at 75%, operating margin at 8% and adjusted free cash flow margin at 12%. Snowflake's Data Cloud strongly resonates in large enterprises and institutions. The idea of getting your data siloed again in the public cloud stack holds limited appeal. Data Cloud maximizes the power and promise of data science and artificial intelligence, a high priority in the modern enterprise.  In the quarter, we added 28 Global 2000 customers. Product revenue from the Global 2000 outpaced the company as a whole, growing 14% quarter-over-quarter. Global 2000 customers now represent over 40% of revenue. Our mission is the Data Cloud, a single data universe across geographies, data sources, compute clouds and cloud regions, a single point of inquiry, analytics and intelligence, maximum enablement of data sciences, analytics and intelligence. Today, Snowflake operates across 37 regional deployments. Year-over-year, we've expanded our footprint by more than 30%. Customers are embracing this vision. 22% of customers have at least one stable edge, up from 17% a year ago. 66% of customers with over $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue have at least one stable edge. Snowflake's marketplace listings grew 11% quarter-over-quarter, now with more than 1,700 data listings. Our strategy is a global data sharing network, coupled with unlimited workload enablement. Work needs to find its way to the data instead of the historical habit of moving data to the work. Much of the work in the announcements you've seen from Snowflake in recent years reflects our progress in and across the workload spectrum from data engineering to data warehousing to data science to data applications and transaction processing. We recently announced the general availability of Python for Snowpark. This is foundational for many workloads and user types. Global 2000 customers, Charter Communications, EDF Energy and Northern Trust have adopted Snowflake for Python. Earlier next year, we will offer native Streamlit integration in private preview. With Streamlit, we're helping developers and data engineers build applications in Snowflake. Since acquisition, the Streamlit community has grown more than 60% and now has approximately 70,000 developers. We're enabling data science workloads with Snowpark optimized workhouses -- warehouses, now in public preview. Optimized warehouses represent a step function improvement for compute-intensive workloads and allow customers to bring ML training into Snowflake. In Q3, we hosted our Data Cloud World Tour, which brought our product announcements to a global audience. We travelled to 18 cities across 12 countries, and reached over 12,000 attendees. In November, we hosted our Annual Developer Conference BUILD, a virtual kickoff at over 4,000 attendees and local breakouts are scheduled in 16 cities across 10 countries. Aside from world-class scale performance and economics, Snowflake differentiates with a relentless focus on enterprise-grade high trust implementation, for security and compliant capabilities enable the largest enterprises and institutions worldwide to deploy Snowflake for the most critical use cases and applications. Privacy and compliance, of course, have become far greater challenges in recent years and created new challenges in data operations. For example, our data clean room operations, which originated in the role of advertising, are now spreading to other vertical industries. Snowflake continues to deepen and strengthen its industry orientation. We expect to understand our customer challenges, solve their problems and speak their language, leading industries for Snowflake are financial services, advertising, media and entertainment, followed by retail and consumer packaged goods, technology and healthcare and life sciences. In Q3, product revenue from the financial services industry grew 13% quarter-over-quarter. Financial services client, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, or DTCC, recently announced their use of Snowflake Marketplace. Providing clearing and settlement services, DTCC has access to a vast amount of training data. DTCC allows clients to engage with its data through Snowflake to better understand market liquidity and investor sentiment. During the quarter, at advertising week, we announced an investment in OpenAP, the advanced advertising company. This will accelerate the development of the OpenAP Data Hub, which is a new cross-publisher and cross-platform clean room solution for the television industry powered by Snowflake. The addition of Snowflake validates the commitment FOX, NBCUniversal, Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery have made to transforming the TV ad industry. We are aware of the weakening macro economy. Customer behavior informs our outlook and investment approach. In Q3, we demonstrated our ability to execute through different economic environments. Our focus remains on revenue growth balanced with free cash flow generation. We are well positioned to drive efficient and durable growth, which Mike will discuss further. The opportunity ahead is massive and will take years to unfold.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. Q3 product revenues were $523 million, representing 67% year-over-year growth, and our remaining performance obligations grew 66% year-over-year totaling $3 billion. Of the $3 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. This represents a 68% increase compared to our estimate as of the same quarter last year. Our net revenue retention rate of 165% includes 14 new customers with $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue and reflects durable growth among our largest customers. With a focus on the acquisition and growth of the largest enterprises in the world, we added 28 Global 2000 customers in the quarter, our largest quarterly addition in the last five periods. We have confidence in our growth opportunity in these accounts because G2K customers only represent $1.3 million of trailing 12-month product revenue on average. This compares to an average of $3.7 million among customers over $1 million in product revenue. We will continue to grow these accounts through value selling and workload enablement. We are seeing this in our largest accounts today. Quarter-over-quarter, six of our top 10 customers grew faster than the company overall. We are monitoring our key business metrics, which we believe are leading indicators of the macro economy impacting our business. In the quarter, we saw varying degrees of strength and weakness worldwide, making it challenging to identify a consistent trend. Our largest segments, North America and EMEA outperformed SMB and APJ, the strength in North America includes the headwind from the consumer Internet companies we mentioned earlier this year. This shows the resiliency of Snowflake as enterprises continue to prioritize data operations. Taking a closer look at specific industries, financial services, our largest vertical, grew faster than the company overall while advertising and media entertainment grew slower, technology as a sector underperformed in the quarter. Each geography and vertical had unique circumstances in the quarter, which will always happen with the consumption model. With that being said, Q3 results reflect strong consumption overall. While we did experience a foreign exchange revenue headwind in the quarter, less than 5% of our revenue is invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. At the moment, we do not evaluate our business on a constant currency basis given the immateriality. Now turning to margins on a non-GAAP basis. Our product gross margin was 75%. Scale in our public cloud data centers and continued growth in large customer accounts contributed to year-over-year gross margin improvement. Operating margin was 8%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and favorability on headcount and marketing spend. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 12%, positively impacted by strong collections. We ended the quarter in a strong cash position with $4.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Now let's turn to our guidance. We remain committed to driving towards greater profitability. We are focused on revenue growth through expanding operating and free cash flow margins. Over the past six weeks, we have seen weaker consumption in APJ and SMB segment. However, recent consumption patterns give us confidence that our largest and most strategic customers will continue to grow. With the holidays approaching and uncertainty with how customers will operate, we believe taking a more conservative approach is responsible as we resource plan for Q4 and fiscal 2024. Even with slower-than-expected growth, we are committed to generating meaningful free cash flow. For the fourth quarter, we expect product revenue between $535 million and $540 million, representing year-over-year growth between 49% and 50%. Turning to margins. We expect on a non-GAAP basis, 1% operating margin, and we expect 360 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect product revenues between $1.919 billion and $1.924 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 68% and 69%. Turning to profitability. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, approximately 75% product gross margin 3% operating margin and 21% adjusted free cash flow margin, and we expect 359 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Year-to-date, we've added over 1,500 net new employees. We view the current hiring market as favorable for Snowflake and we'll continue to focus hiring in product, engineering and sales. While we are currently in our planning cycle, we would like to discuss next year's growth outlook based on the consumption we are seeing today. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect product revenue growth of approximately 47% and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 23% and continued expansion of operating margin. This outlook includes a slowdown in hiring, which we evaluate on a monthly basis, but assumes adding over 1,000 net new employees. Our long-term opportunity remains strong, and we look forward to executing.  With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is with Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: My question was, as you think about next year, how should we think about existing customers versus new customers? You obviously had a record new customer adds. What are you seeing in terms of customers' willingness to [join] (ph) it like normally in the olden days in people would stay with the incumbent in tough times and just batten down the hatches, et cetera. It seems to be different for you. So could you speak a little bit of what you're expecting new customers versus existing customers in the guidance?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. Well, Raimo, in terms of -- from a revenue perspective, most of the revenue is really driven by our existing customers because it takes customers time to get their data into Snowflake and ramp up production. But with that said, we're still very much focused on landing new customers. It's not really the quantity. It's the quality of new customers. We tend to focus very much on the largest enterprises and Global 2000 is one of the metrics that we give. But it's not just Global 2000, it's large public sector clients as well as a lot of the big private companies in the world as well, too. And so we're going to continue to do that. And as you can see by the Global 2000, they're still willing to do -- bring in new vendors.\nOperator: Our next question is with Kirk Materne from Evercore.\nKirk Materne : Mike, you mentioned that there weren't any patterns or stuff to decipher just given you guys are across a number of different verticals and geographies. But I was curious in the verticals that are doing well, like financial services and the like are you starting to see that the network effects that come along with Snowflake are really helping those verticals do well despite the macro backdrop. It's just interesting to note that your stable edges are up. And I expect those verticals where you've really built out industry-specific functionalities playing out and perhaps those customers are able to grow faster just because they're more locked in across the entire industry. Can you just talk about that?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. Well, I'll start and then I'll let Frank. Well, clearly, the network effect is important, and we really do see that in financial services, which have the biggest concentration of stable edges. And you can see that in the outperformance of financial services. But definitely, we are seeing the network effect and it's really the data sharing is one of the things that -- things that is driving that.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. The other thing, Kirk, is every industry has its own unique set of dynamics that we call in other words, things that are driving data networking relationships between entities. For example, in healthcare, it's through relationships between payers and providers, in media and entertainment, there's enormous amount of data sharing going on there in terms of consumer packaged goods, the advertisers, retailers and so on. So they're all a little different. As Mike said, financial is very much driven by the fact that historically in financial services institutions are pumping massive amounts of data around every single night to all these different destinations, especially in asset management and subsectors like that. So we really view -- I mean, data network in plays out differently in every industry sector and subsector, but they become -- there's a lot of data gravity is what we call it that starts to happen that benefits us enormously. It really lowers the friction of getting access to new accounts, and you see that very pronounced in verticals like financial services.\nOperator: Our next question is with Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. I wanted to go back, Mike, to some of the guidance framework that you laid out for us, particularly with respect to fiscal year '24, I think you talked about 47% growth. Is there any way you can sort of draw the bridge for us in terms of next quarter you're guiding to think about 49% at the high end; and then for the full year next year, approximately 47%. What sort of gives you the confidence that your Q4 exit growth rate is going to be durable going into next year?\nMike Scarpelli: Sure. Well, I'll say Q4 is -- it is a quarter that has a lot of holidays in it, and we do think we've lived through COVID that people are traveling more. There is a big human component as well, too. So we all along have been forecasting that Q4, we'd see the impact of that, but we also have a number of significant customers that we have signed up, that we see them ramping up next year on Snowflake as well as some of the things we're doing with Snowpark with Python, we're starting to see traction in that as well, too. But we think that's going to be more of a 2024 impact.\nSanjit Singh : Makes total sense. And then I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of sense of the consumption, the cohorts and how they're sort of behaving. So you've talked quite positively about the top 10 customers and obviously, new customers don't contribute even though that's coming in at a very fast clip. But if we strip out just the top 10 customers and the new customers, that sort of core customer base, how has those underlying expansion trends materializing over the quarter and as we've gotten past the October quarter into November, December, what are some of the underlying trends for the core of the business outside of the top 10?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. Well, let me clarify something on the top 10, when I said six are growing faster than the pace of the company. We actually have three that actually sequentially were down in the quarter, which was expected, and those are some of those companies we talked about early in the year, and they're all in the technology sector that wouldn't surprise you if you knew their names. But what I will say is we continue to see strength, in particular, in financial services, the advertising and media space. Where we do see weakness is we do see weakness in APJ and a lot of that has to do with the fact the FX is really impacting them. And then you do see weakness -- I didn't see it in the bookings but in consumption in the more of the SMB customers. We do see that as we call them our corporate accounts, but these are the 500 or less employees and I definitely did see some consumption weakness, but I want to stress, I didn't see they need bookings that they have that added RPO, but definitely out of consumption.\nOperator: Our next question is with Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin : So I guess if I -- it sounds like there's a lot of nuance across a lot of different industries and customer sizes and geographies. If we think about the guidance for next year, are you guiding to -- you mentioned the guide for next quarter, it's prudent to assume a more riskier or a more prudent scenario around the continuation of macro trends. What are you assuming for next year? Is there a linearity where you're assuming a second half better than the first half or continuing to get worse? Walk us through some of the puts and takes around that guidance trajectory.\nMike Scarpelli: I'm factoring in that we're going to continue to stay consistent where we are right now through the balance of next year. And if the things turn around, that's upside for us. And as I said, this is just as we're doing planning right now, we're not expecting things to change. And I really don't know and probably maybe you have a better sense, but all I can do is forecast based upon what we see today.\nAlex Zukin : Got it. And for some of the customers or cohorts that you're seeing where like they're sequentially declining, are you starting to see kind of we're working with them around a new baseline? Like basically, when do some of these optimization patterns kind of rebase and start growing in some of these new areas like Streamlit and others that you're out there in the market with?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, what I would say is these are three customers that's unique to them with the challenges that they've been placing or had in their businesses that have been pretty public. And I think too one of the reasons why as I said, technology has underperformed. We are seeing a lot of technology companies you're hearing in the news that are either freezing hiring or cutting headcount and they're definitely looking to optimize on cost. But these three customers, in particular, I think we're at their baseline right now. And as long as their businesses kind of stabilize and grow, then we'll see some growth out of them, but I'm not factoring any growth in them this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is with Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Our next question will be with Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz : Congratulations on delivering very healthy product revenue in this environment. My question relates to Q4, where obviously the product revenue guidance was below where consensus was. And I'm curious, how much of this Mike is a reflection of a moderation in consumption in the month of November or over the last six weeks, as you said, in APJ and across the SMB as opposed to embedding more conservatism amid the existing macro uncertainty. Would you say it's tilted more towards one versus the other?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, the way we do our forecast is based upon historical performance, and we definitely did see a slowdown in the month of October, not that dramatic, but we typically would see week-over-week growth and we saw a number of weeks where it was pretty flat. I will say November is starting to tick back up again, and that's all factored into the guidance given the macro backdrop we have right now.\nOperator: Our next question is with Simon Leopold from Raymond James.\nVictor Chiu: This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. Previously, your commentary seemed to imply that slowing consumption in a weaker macro environment would be more concentrated around customer groups or verticals. Is that still the case? It seems that that's still the case. I just want to confirm. And what, I guess, has changed versus your expectations in the past? What kind of trends are you observing that are kind of falling out of what you were expecting previously?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, to be clear, it hasn't changed that much from what we've been expecting all year. And as I said, there are certain verticals that are not performing as well, technology being one of them that we mentioned from where we were six months ago. Financial services doing extremely well and expect that to continue. Actually, we landed a very nice deal in the financial services sector that, that customer will ramp in the second half of next year and will be a meaningful customer, will be a top 10 customer one day. And the other area that, as I mentioned, is doing very, very well, is the whole advertising media space, and a lot of that is driven by our clean room technology and what we're doing there as well, too. I would say the only thing that's really changed this quarter, and it's a very small piece of our overall revenue is the SMB segment, you're really seeing a slowdown in consumption by those customers. It's not going away, but it's just not growing like it was at the pace of growth. And same with APJ. But the U.S. verticals, large enterprises, doing extremely well.\nVictor Chiu : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess can you just give us an update around some of your new initiatives like Snowpark and unstructured data and just kind of the traction and progress you're having with those initiatives?\nChristian Kleinerman : Christian Kleinerman here. Snowpark saw GA in November 7. And as a percentage of customers that are evaluating the technology, it's a very healthy rate. The consumption has not yet materialized because they're planning premigration doing POCs, et cetera, but it's quite promising. And as Frank mentioned, Streamlit will be in private preview at the beginning of the year, which we also think will have a good number of interesting use cases to our customers.\nOperator: Our next question is with Kamil Mielczarek from William Blair.\nKamil Mielczarek : You've done a great job growing the sales force this year, the pace of hiring seems to have accelerated in the quarter. Can you talk about where you're focusing incremental investments? And should we expect these new hires to begin to contribute in fiscal '24 to revenue? Or will the impact to come in 18 to 24 months, given the time it takes for new customers around?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, we're very much focused this year on our hiring and our sales force to go into existing markets. We're not opening many new territories this year, and it's really to go deeper into core markets, both verticals, North America but in particular, Germany, France and the U.K. as well as Australia and Japan and APJ. And we do believe these people will be contributing to bookings more in the second half of next year. And remember, when a booking comes in, it takes a while before you really start to see meaningful revenue from those customers. Generally, it's a six-month lag before they really ramp up.\nKamil Mielczarek : That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Can you update us on Python environment? Are you seeing any changes, particularly on the product side?\nMike Scarpelli: Sorry, I didn't quite get that. Update on what?\nKamil Mielczarek : The competitive environment?\nFrank Slootman : It's Frank. I would say that the competitive dynamic is substantially unchanged. We're -- I think the balance of partnership versus competition shifts marginally from 1 period to the next. I think we've set publicly that our partnership with AWS Amazon has been incrementally stronger and less competitive over time and that continues. Microsoft has been healthy and with Google GCP has been about the same. Most of our competitive reality, if you will, is really dominated by the public cloud companies, and that's been true for as long as we've been here.\nOperator: Our next question is with Derrick Wood from Cowen & Company.\nDerrick Wood : Great. I always like that you guys highlight the average G2K spend, I think you said it was $1.3 million. As you look at other companies that are more mature, have larger revenue scale or even as you look at your own more mature customers, what do you think the longer-term level of spend out of an average G2K customer could be down the road? And then I guess, more specific to the quarter, you did have a strong G2K add, strongest in five quarters. Are you seeing any pickup in migration activity or anything to call out in terms of strength this quarter?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. I'll just say on the G2K, there's no reason why a G2K can't spend well north of $10 million a year on Snowflake and that's a conservative number. But it will take time to get there. This is really a marathon. It's not a sprint for our customers, and it will take time. And we are starting to see very large customer relationships. We did sign a $100 million contract in the quarter, again, with an existing customer on renewal, and we will have $100 million plus contracts this quarter in Q4 with customers that I know are running out of credits and want to lock in for long term. So it's just going to take time to grow these customers. Just like it took us, I think Capital One is one of our -- is our largest customer. It's taken them 5.3 years to get to where we are now. Most of our top 10 customers, with the exception of 1 in 4.5, 5 years old customers to get into that top 10. And we think that trend will continue that it will take customers that long to ramp to get to those sizes. And then sorry, Derrick, what was the second part of your question.\nDerrick Wood : Just the strength in the G2K adds in the quarter and if there was anything to call out, if you're seeing perhaps a pickup in kind of legacy migration activity.\nMike Scarpelli: No. What I want to remind you, though, too, is selling into a Global 2000 is not a one or two-quarter event. These are one to two-year sales cycles. So it wasn't surprising to us that we landed these. We've been working on these for quite some time, just like we have a very healthy pipeline of 1 for all of next year. What quarter they'll land in is really hard to say. But even if I land them, it takes me six, nine months to ramp them. But we're very focused on those, and we know who they all are, and we have reps assigned to them. \nOperator: Our next question is with Sterling Auty from SVB.\nSterling Auty: I'm just wondering with the macro uncertainty, if you're seeing any customer behavior changes in terms of the type of data that they're ingesting or even if they modify and reduce some of the data ingestion that maybe they were doing previously?\nFrank Slootman : This is Frank. Not really seeing that. We have done a lot of traveling during the quarter inside and outside the country. And I think one of the sentiments that I want to mention is that we're sort of past -- sort of the bleeding edge earlier adopter class customers that we have acquired over the last, whatever, five, six, seven years. And we're now into the people that didn't sign up early on. And their overriding sentiment is a sense of somewhat a fear of missing out. And they're looking at us like we can't be left behind, help us catch up. And a lot of times, the challenges around that are based on their ability to harness the technology in terms of the skills and the expertise. So in other words, our mix of tools is going to evolve to really help customers address that gap because of anything they want to accelerate they want to lean in, they want to move faster. They literally overriding sentiment is we're afraid to be left behind. This is how important this is. And they are clearly identifying what they think is holding them up in terms of getting there.\nOperator: Our next question is with Brad Reback from Stifel.\nBrad Reback : Mike, as we think about the macro backdrop, what, if any, impact should we expect to -- for that to have on an RPO in 4Q?\nMike Scarpelli: I don't see it having a big impact on Q4 based upon the pipeline of deals and knowing the number of customers I know are running out of credits. And I should say, from a current RPO, the big question is whether customers in this environment will do multiyear deals or just choose to renew for 1 year, which they have the option to do as well, too. But with that said, I know Q4 will always be our largest addition to RPO. And based upon all the sales calls that we have, I feel pretty good about that right now where we're sitting. But obviously, there's still two months left in the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is with Will Power from Baird.\nWill Power : Mike, it was great to see the higher free cash flow guidance, I guess, this year initial expectations for next year. And I guess the longer-term target looks pretty conservative, I guess in light of that, but it would be great just to get kind of perspective on kind of the key upside drivers there relative to what you were previously anticipating.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, part of it is just what we guided to. This year is going to come in where we thought it was going to come in for the second half of the year. But a lot of it is driven by customer consumption with some of our largest customers and knowing the RPO that they have and the timing of when those things are going to get billed. But coupled with the fact that we are slowing our hiring down next year, we're seeing very positive gross margin improvements. I do think there's more opportunity next year for gross margin improvement, but wait until we guide just based upon some things we're in discussions with the cloud providers. And I feel pretty good about those numbers sitting here right now on our preliminary planning for next year.\nOperator: Our next question is with Mike Cikos from Needham & Company.\nMike Cikos : I had a question about the optimization trends that we're seeing from customers and really, it relates to the cohorts here. But given the current macro backdrop, is it fair to think that newer customers who maybe were onboarded in the most recent six or nine months and are on that growth trajectory? Are they at a slower rate versus previous cohorts? Can you elaborate at all as far as what the more recent cohorts are demonstrating from a growth perspective?\nMike Scarpelli: I really haven't looked at that, but I'm not -- what I will say is customers today, we spend a lot more time with them on making sure they use Snowflake efficiently, and there's a lot more people that have experience with Snowflake that it's -- I think the customers that were growing on Snowflake today that are starting out are much, much more efficient in how they use Snowflake. But I'll turn it over to Christian, who actually talks to a lot of our customers.\nChristian Kleinerman : Yes. We're very focused on helping our customers do not go through a cycle of grow, optimize, grow, optimize, but just being a smoother curve all along. And it is, as Mike said, expectation setting, explaining with training and other material, but also product enhancement and we're seeing that type of behavior, both with existing and new customers.\nWill Power: Got it. And one more house cleaning, if I could, but sorry, housekeeping, if I could. But can you just remind us what the revenue exposure is from a contribution standpoint from that SMB segment that we have called out?\nMike Scarpelli: It's less than 10% -- it's right around 10%.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Steve Koenig from SMBC.\nSteve Koenig : Great. So your ability to grow revenue 67% year-on-year in this environment speaks to very strong long-term adoption trends. But I'm wondering more on a short-term basis, if we look at quarter-on-quarter product revenue additions, I think it's kind of gone flattish in Q3 year-on-year and may go negative next quarter. So I'm wondering, how do you think about planning your sales additions and maintaining sales productivity? I'm curious about your thought process there. That's all I have.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. I will say in a consumption model, quarter-over-quarter additions is not as meaningful because so much of the consumption is tied to what customers are doing at specific times in their business. And also Q4, as I said, is one that has seasonally higher number of holidays with people taking -- and remember, about 70% of our revenue is tied to human interaction with our system, 30% is really driven by scheduled jobs. So that has an impact. But also, I want to remind you that a lot of the stuff we've been doing around hardware improvements and stuff is really hitting us in Q4.\nOperator: Our final question shall be from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin : Thanks for squeezing me in here. I totally get how consumption could slow here just given some of the challenges in these verticals, obviously, recessionary headwinds. I'd be curious and more curious to hear the offset to consumption, which is expanding number of use cases. So do you have any sights or visibility into how in a recessionary environment, customers' appetite to expand either the new departments or expand into data science. Some of our job postings data suggests that there are people aggressively hiring for Snowflake and data science scenarios. I'd love to get the view here on how quickly over the next year or two, you could see use cases drive an offset to consumption?\nChristian Kleinerman : Yes. Just having visited with lots of customers during our Data Cloud world tour, we see pretty high interest on a number of new use cases, Snowpark for data engineering as well as data science, cyber security is a new workload, we see a lot of intercept from our customers. And even though it's a little bit later when to materialize on our end, unit store and the ability to build applications in Snowflake is definitely driving a lot of interest. So the willingness to expand the use cases seems unaffected by the broader context.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks, Jimmy, and good afternoon, everybody. Snowflake continues to drive strong growth at scale, coupled with strengthened unit economics, operating profit and free cash flow. While we acknowledge the weakening global macro context, we remain resilient in terms of our results. We believe this resilience reflects the importance of data strategy in modern enterprises and institutions. Data is becoming deeply ingrained in how global enterprises think, act, decide and strategize. Relying on anecdotal observations will increasingly take a back seat to data-driven operations.  The company is reporting $523 million in product revenue, growing 67% year-on-year. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 66% year-on-year to $3 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, product gross margin came in at 75%, operating margin at 8% and adjusted free cash flow margin at 12%. Snowflake's Data Cloud strongly resonates in large enterprises and institutions. The idea of getting your data siloed again in the public cloud stack holds limited appeal. Data Cloud maximizes the power and promise of data science and artificial intelligence, a high priority in the modern enterprise.  In the quarter, we added 28 Global 2000 customers. Product revenue from the Global 2000 outpaced the company as a whole, growing 14% quarter-over-quarter. Global 2000 customers now represent over 40% of revenue. Our mission is the Data Cloud, a single data universe across geographies, data sources, compute clouds and cloud regions, a single point of inquiry, analytics and intelligence, maximum enablement of data sciences, analytics and intelligence. Today, Snowflake operates across 37 regional deployments. Year-over-year, we've expanded our footprint by more than 30%. Customers are embracing this vision. 22% of customers have at least one stable edge, up from 17% a year ago. 66% of customers with over $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue have at least one stable edge. Snowflake's marketplace listings grew 11% quarter-over-quarter, now with more than 1,700 data listings. Our strategy is a global data sharing network, coupled with unlimited workload enablement. Work needs to find its way to the data instead of the historical habit of moving data to the work. Much of the work in the announcements you've seen from Snowflake in recent years reflects our progress in and across the workload spectrum from data engineering to data warehousing to data science to data applications and transaction processing. We recently announced the general availability of Python for Snowpark. This is foundational for many workloads and user types. Global 2000 customers, Charter Communications, EDF Energy and Northern Trust have adopted Snowflake for Python. Earlier next year, we will offer native Streamlit integration in private preview. With Streamlit, we're helping developers and data engineers build applications in Snowflake. Since acquisition, the Streamlit community has grown more than 60% and now has approximately 70,000 developers. We're enabling data science workloads with Snowpark optimized workhouses -- warehouses, now in public preview. Optimized warehouses represent a step function improvement for compute-intensive workloads and allow customers to bring ML training into Snowflake. In Q3, we hosted our Data Cloud World Tour, which brought our product announcements to a global audience. We travelled to 18 cities across 12 countries, and reached over 12,000 attendees. In November, we hosted our Annual Developer Conference BUILD, a virtual kickoff at over 4,000 attendees and local breakouts are scheduled in 16 cities across 10 countries. Aside from world-class scale performance and economics, Snowflake differentiates with a relentless focus on enterprise-grade high trust implementation, for security and compliant capabilities enable the largest enterprises and institutions worldwide to deploy Snowflake for the most critical use cases and applications. Privacy and compliance, of course, have become far greater challenges in recent years and created new challenges in data operations. For example, our data clean room operations, which originated in the role of advertising, are now spreading to other vertical industries. Snowflake continues to deepen and strengthen its industry orientation. We expect to understand our customer challenges, solve their problems and speak their language, leading industries for Snowflake are financial services, advertising, media and entertainment, followed by retail and consumer packaged goods, technology and healthcare and life sciences. In Q3, product revenue from the financial services industry grew 13% quarter-over-quarter. Financial services client, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, or DTCC, recently announced their use of Snowflake Marketplace. Providing clearing and settlement services, DTCC has access to a vast amount of training data. DTCC allows clients to engage with its data through Snowflake to better understand market liquidity and investor sentiment. During the quarter, at advertising week, we announced an investment in OpenAP, the advanced advertising company. This will accelerate the development of the OpenAP Data Hub, which is a new cross-publisher and cross-platform clean room solution for the television industry powered by Snowflake. The addition of Snowflake validates the commitment FOX, NBCUniversal, Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery have made to transforming the TV ad industry. We are aware of the weakening macro economy. Customer behavior informs our outlook and investment approach. In Q3, we demonstrated our ability to execute through different economic environments. Our focus remains on revenue growth balanced with free cash flow generation. We are well positioned to drive efficient and durable growth, which Mike will discuss further. The opportunity ahead is massive and will take years to unfold.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Yes. The other thing, Kirk, is every industry has its own unique set of dynamics that we call in other words, things that are driving data networking relationships between entities. For example, in healthcare, it's through relationships between payers and providers, in media and entertainment, there's enormous amount of data sharing going on there in terms of consumer packaged goods, the advertisers, retailers and so on. So they're all a little different. As Mike said, financial is very much driven by the fact that historically in financial services institutions are pumping massive amounts of data around every single night to all these different destinations, especially in asset management and subsectors like that. So we really view -- I mean, data network in plays out differently in every industry sector and subsector, but they become -- there's a lot of data gravity is what we call it that starts to happen that benefits us enormously. It really lowers the friction of getting access to new accounts, and you see that very pronounced in verticals like financial services. It's Frank. I would say that the competitive dynamic is substantially unchanged. We're -- I think the balance of partnership versus competition shifts marginally from 1 period to the next. I think we've set publicly that our partnership with AWS Amazon has been incrementally stronger and less competitive over time and that continues. Microsoft has been healthy and with Google GCP has been about the same. Most of our competitive reality, if you will, is really dominated by the public cloud companies, and that's been true for as long as we've been here. This is Frank. Not really seeing that.

            "name": "Mike Scarpelli",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Q3 product revenues were $523 million, representing 67% year-over-year growth, and our remaining performance obligations grew 66% year-over-year totaling $3 billion. Of the $3 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 55% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. This represents a 68% increase compared to our estimate as of the same quarter last year. Our net revenue retention rate of 165% includes 14 new customers with $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue and reflects durable growth among our largest customers. With a focus on the acquisition and growth of the largest enterprises in the world, we added 28 Global 2000 customers in the quarter, our largest quarterly addition in the last five periods. We have confidence in our growth opportunity in these accounts because G2K customers only represent $1.3 million of trailing 12-month product revenue on average. This compares to an average of $3.7 million among customers over $1 million in product revenue. We will continue to grow these accounts through value selling and workload enablement. We are seeing this in our largest accounts today. Quarter-over-quarter, six of our top 10 customers grew faster than the company overall. We are monitoring our key business metrics, which we believe are leading indicators of the macro economy impacting our business. In the quarter, we saw varying degrees of strength and weakness worldwide, making it challenging to identify a consistent trend. Our largest segments, North America and EMEA outperformed SMB and APJ, the strength in North America includes the headwind from the consumer Internet companies we mentioned earlier this year. This shows the resiliency of Snowflake as enterprises continue to prioritize data operations. Taking a closer look at specific industries, financial services, our largest vertical, grew faster than the company overall while advertising and media entertainment grew slower, technology as a sector underperformed in the quarter. Each geography and vertical had unique circumstances in the quarter, which will always happen with the consumption model. With that being said, Q3 results reflect strong consumption overall. While we did experience a foreign exchange revenue headwind in the quarter, less than 5% of our revenue is invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. At the moment, we do not evaluate our business on a constant currency basis given the immateriality. Now turning to margins on a non-GAAP basis. Our product gross margin was 75%. Scale in our public cloud data centers and continued growth in large customer accounts contributed to year-over-year gross margin improvement. Operating margin was 8%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and favorability on headcount and marketing spend. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 12%, positively impacted by strong collections. We ended the quarter in a strong cash position with $4.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Now let's turn to our guidance. We remain committed to driving towards greater profitability. We are focused on revenue growth through expanding operating and free cash flow margins. Over the past six weeks, we have seen weaker consumption in APJ and SMB segment. However, recent consumption patterns give us confidence that our largest and most strategic customers will continue to grow. With the holidays approaching and uncertainty with how customers will operate, we believe taking a more conservative approach is responsible as we resource plan for Q4 and fiscal 2024. Even with slower-than-expected growth, we are committed to generating meaningful free cash flow. For the fourth quarter, we expect product revenue between $535 million and $540 million, representing year-over-year growth between 49% and 50%. Turning to margins. We expect on a non-GAAP basis, 1% operating margin, and we expect 360 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect product revenues between $1.919 billion and $1.924 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 68% and 69%. Turning to profitability. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, approximately 75% product gross margin 3% operating margin and 21% adjusted free cash flow margin, and we expect 359 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Year-to-date, we've added over 1,500 net new employees. We view the current hiring market as favorable for Snowflake and we'll continue to focus hiring in product, engineering and sales. While we are currently in our planning cycle, we would like to discuss next year's growth outlook based on the consumption we are seeing today. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect product revenue growth of approximately 47% and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 23% and continued expansion of operating margin. This outlook includes a slowdown in hiring, which we evaluate on a monthly basis, but assumes adding over 1,000 net new employees. Our long-term opportunity remains strong, and we look forward to executing.  With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Yes. Well, Raimo, in terms of -- from a revenue perspective, most of the revenue is really driven by our existing customers because it takes customers time to get their data into Snowflake and ramp up production. But with that said, we're still very much focused on landing new customers. It's not really the quantity. It's the quality of new customers. We tend to focus very much on the largest enterprises and Global 2000 is one of the metrics that we give. But it's not just Global 2000, it's large public sector clients as well as a lot of the big private companies in the world as well, too. And so we're going to continue to do that. And as you can see by the Global 2000, they're still willing to do -- bring in new vendors. Yes. Well, I'll start and then I'll let Frank. Well, clearly, the network effect is important, and we really do see that in financial services, which have the biggest concentration of stable edges. And you can see that in the outperformance of financial services. But definitely, we are seeing the network effect and it's really the data sharing is one of the things that -- things that is driving that. Sure. Well, I'll say Q4 is -- it is a quarter that has a lot of holidays in it, and we do think we've lived through COVID that people are traveling more. There is a big human component as well, too. So we all along have been forecasting that Q4, we'd see the impact of that, but we also have a number of significant customers that we have signed up, that we see them ramping up next year on Snowflake as well as some of the things we're doing with Snowpark with Python, we're starting to see traction in that as well, too. But we think that's going to be more of a 2024 impact. Yes. Well, let me clarify something on the top 10, when I said six are growing faster than the pace of the company. We actually have three that actually sequentially were down in the quarter, which was expected, and those are some of those companies we talked about early in the year, and they're all in the technology sector that wouldn't surprise you if you knew their names. But what I will say is we continue to see strength, in particular, in financial services, the advertising and media space. Where we do see weakness is we do see weakness in APJ and a lot of that has to do with the fact the FX is really impacting them. And then you do see weakness -- I didn't see it in the bookings but in consumption in the more of the SMB customers. We do see that as we call them our corporate accounts, but these are the 500 or less employees and I definitely did see some consumption weakness, but I want to stress, I didn't see they need bookings that they have that added RPO, but definitely out of consumption. I'm factoring in that we're going to continue to stay consistent where we are right now through the balance of next year. And if the things turn around, that's upside for us. And as I said, this is just as we're doing planning right now, we're not expecting things to change. And I really don't know and probably maybe you have a better sense, but all I can do is forecast based upon what we see today. Well, what I would say is these are three customers that's unique to them with the challenges that they've been placing or had in their businesses that have been pretty public. And I think too one of the reasons why as I said, technology has underperformed. We are seeing a lot of technology companies you're hearing in the news that are either freezing hiring or cutting headcount and they're definitely looking to optimize on cost. But these three customers, in particular, I think we're at their baseline right now. And as long as their businesses kind of stabilize and grow, then we'll see some growth out of them, but I'm not factoring any growth in them this quarter. Well, the way we do our forecast is based upon historical performance, and we definitely did see a slowdown in the month of October, not that dramatic, but we typically would see week-over-week growth and we saw a number of weeks where it was pretty flat. I will say November is starting to tick back up again, and that's all factored into the guidance given the macro backdrop we have right now. Well, to be clear, it hasn't changed that much from what we've been expecting all year. And as I said, there are certain verticals that are not performing as well, technology being one of them that we mentioned from where we were six months ago. Financial services doing extremely well and expect that to continue. Actually, we landed a very nice deal in the financial services sector that, that customer will ramp in the second half of next year and will be a meaningful customer, will be a top 10 customer one day. And the other area that, as I mentioned, is doing very, very well, is the whole advertising media space, and a lot of that is driven by our clean room technology and what we're doing there as well, too. I would say the only thing that's really changed this quarter, and it's a very small piece of our overall revenue is the SMB segment, you're really seeing a slowdown in consumption by those customers. It's not going away, but it's just not growing like it was at the pace of growth. And same with APJ. But the U.S. verticals, large enterprises, doing extremely well. Well, we're very much focused this year on our hiring and our sales force to go into existing markets. We're not opening many new territories this year, and it's really to go deeper into core markets, both verticals, North America but in particular, Germany, France and the U.K. as well as Australia and Japan and APJ. And we do believe these people will be contributing to bookings more in the second half of next year. And remember, when a booking comes in, it takes a while before you really start to see meaningful revenue from those customers. Generally, it's a six-month lag before they really ramp up. Sorry, I didn't quite get that. Update on what? Yes. I'll just say on the G2K, there's no reason why a G2K can't spend well north of $10 million a year on Snowflake and that's a conservative number. But it will take time to get there. This is really a marathon. It's not a sprint for our customers, and it will take time. And we are starting to see very large customer relationships. We did sign a $100 million contract in the quarter, again, with an existing customer on renewal, and we will have $100 million plus contracts this quarter in Q4 with customers that I know are running out of credits and want to lock in for long term. So it's just going to take time to grow these customers. Just like it took us, I think Capital One is one of our -- is our largest customer. It's taken them 5.3 years to get to where we are now. Most of our top 10 customers, with the exception of 1 in 4.5, 5 years old customers to get into that top 10. And we think that trend will continue that it will take customers that long to ramp to get to those sizes. And then sorry, Derrick, what was the second part of your question. No. What I want to remind you, though, too, is selling into a Global 2000 is not a one or two-quarter event. These are one to two-year sales cycles. So it wasn't surprising to us that we landed these. We've been working on these for quite some time, just like we have a very healthy pipeline of 1 for all of next year. What quarter they'll land in is really hard to say. But even if I land them, it takes me six, nine months to ramp them. But we're very focused on those, and we know who they all are, and we have reps assigned to them. I don't see it having a big impact on Q4 based upon the pipeline of deals and knowing the number of customers I know are running out of credits. And I should say, from a current RPO, the big question is whether customers in this environment will do multiyear deals or just choose to renew for 1 year, which they have the option to do as well, too. But with that said, I know Q4 will always be our largest addition to RPO. And based upon all the sales calls that we have, I feel pretty good about that right now where we're sitting. But obviously, there's still two months left in the quarter. Well, part of it is just what we guided to. This year is going to come in where we thought it was going to come in for the second half of the year. But a lot of it is driven by customer consumption with some of our largest customers and knowing the RPO that they have and the timing of when those things are going to get billed. But coupled with the fact that we are slowing our hiring down next year, we're seeing very positive gross margin improvements. I do think there's more opportunity next year for gross margin improvement, but wait until we guide just based upon some things we're in discussions with the cloud providers. And I feel pretty good about those numbers sitting here right now on our preliminary planning for next year. I really haven't looked at that, but I'm not -- what I will say is customers today, we spend a lot more time with them on making sure they use Snowflake efficiently, and there's a lot more people that have experience with Snowflake that it's -- I think the customers that were growing on Snowflake today that are starting out are much, much more efficient in how they use Snowflake. But I'll turn it over to Christian, who actually talks to a lot of our customers. It's less than 10% -- it's right around 10%. Yes. I will say in a consumption model, quarter-over-quarter additions is not as meaningful because so much of the consumption is tied to what customers are doing at specific times in their business. And also Q4, as I said, is one that has seasonally higher number of holidays with people taking -- and remember, about 70% of our revenue is tied to human interaction with our system, 30% is really driven by scheduled jobs. So that has an impact. But also, I want to remind you that a lot of the stuff we've been doing around hardware improvements and stuff is really hitting us in Q4."

My name is Hannah and I will be your moderator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jimmy Sexton, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Sexton: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on Snowflake\u2019s Q2 fiscal 2023 earnings call. With me in both in Montana are Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer; and Christian Kleinerman, our Senior Vice President of Products, will join us for the Q&A session. During today\u2019s call, we will review our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2023. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, products and features, long-term growth and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended April 30, 2022 and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2022 that we will file with the SEC. We caution you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations. We would also like to point out that on today\u2019s call we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. To see the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings press release distributed earlier today and our investor presentation, which are posted at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks, Jimmy and good afternoon everybody. Product revenue grew 83% year-on-year to $466 million. Remaining performance obligations grew 78% year-on-year to $2.7 billion and in the quarter, we added 12 Global 2000 customers. Our net revenue retention rate exceeded 170% and Snowflake leads the industry with a net promoter score of 72. Snowflake is delivering high growth and operating leverage. Non-GAAP product gross margin exceeded 75% and we continue to generate non-GAAP operating income and free cash flow. Our success is fueled by broad-based workload enablement. The core idea behind the Snowflake Data Cloud is to enable work to come to the data and prevent data from having to be moved to the work. Previously, data was copied, transferred and replicated to be used wherever it was processed. That led to massive operational complexity, cost and governance risks. The Snowflake Data Cloud promises to bring that regrettable legacy to an end. Starting in 2014, Snowflake\u2019s cloud native architecture removed the scale, performance and economic bottlenecks that held back data analytics at scale for generations. The impact was immediate and led to a major expansion of workloads and use cases. Initially, organizations use Snowflake to drastically improve overnight analytical processes so that fresh up-to-date data about the business was reliably available first thing. Checking that box, customers move on to using data for predictive insights and prescriptive solutions. This is what has driven Snowflake\u2019s massive platform expansion in terms of workload types, user types and data types. Snowflake\u2019s data sharing solves the challenge of data access and enrichment. In Q2, the number of Snowflake data sharing relationships measured with what we call stable edges grew 112% year-on-year. 21% of our growing customer base has at least one stable edge, up from 15% a year ago. Among customers over $1 million in product revenue, 65% have at least one stable edge. Across sectors, we are meeting customers with solutions pertinent to their vertical industries. For example, supply chain management realized in Snowflake\u2019s combination of execution and access. We hear how supply chain management is failing at many levels because of dislocations such as the pandemic and spiking inflation. This is, in large part, a data problem. The data originates in different places, which is why it was such a challenging time coming together. And the world is stable and changing marginally day-to-day, this has been somewhat tolerable. Now with massive disruption in the status quo must change. Our next frontier of innovation is aimed at reinventing cloud application development. Our ambition is far reaching. Our aim is to transform how cloud applications are built, deployed, sold and transacted. To help achieve this, we launched our Powered by Snowflake program. Today, we have 590 Powered by Snowflake registrants, representing 35% quarter-over-quarter growth. We announced a number of significant product innovations at our Summit Users Conference in June, which saw an approximate fivefold increase in attendance from 2019. These announcements are foundational for that vision. Unistore allows developers to bridge transactional and analytical workloads in a single dataset to save users\u2019 time and effort associated with moving and transforming data across systems. Snowpark for Python is now in public preview. This capability brings more optionality to a technical audience of application developers, data engineers and data scientists. Our integration with the recently acquired Streamlit is tracking well against plan. Streamlit bridges the gap between data scientists and business users, accelerating time to insight by enabling developers to build applications using their favorite tools. Finally, we announced support for Apache Iceberg table formats in private preview. Iceberg is the emerging standard for data lake architectures. With this offering, we bring the performance and governance benefits of Snowflake to externally stored data. We are pleased to announce our intent to acquire Applica. Applica mobilizes unstructured data for advanced analytics and machine learning. Applica\u2019s team and best-in-class technology will create opportunities for customers and partners to get more value from all data types. We believe our strategy and underlying market trends position us for success. We look forward to executing against this growing opportunity. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. Q2 product revenues were $466 million, representing 83% year-over-year growth and remaining performance obligations grew 78% year-over-year, totaling $2.7 billion. Of the $2.7 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 57% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. This represents a 79% increase compared to our estimate as of the same quarter last year. Our net revenue retention rate of 171% includes 15 new customers with $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue and reflects durable growth among our largest customers. We continue to pursue a vertical sales strategy. Our core verticals are financial services, advertising, media and entertainment, retail and CPG, technology and healthcare and life sciences. While all verticals are growing rapidly, financial services drove the most product revenue growth sequentially. Advertising, media and entertainment and technology verticals grew in line with the overall company. Driving this growth is our continual move up market. In the quarter, we added 12 new Global 2000 customers. Our average trailing 12-month product revenue from these customers grew 14% quarter-over-quarter to $1.2 million. We believe these accounts will grow to become our largest customers. A Global 2000 technology company is now a top 10 product revenue customer, less than 2 years after signing their initial deal. Last quarter, we called out customers that were negatively impacted by headwinds specific to their businesses. The Q2 results from these customers were mixed. Some saw the weakness we expected while others outperformed. We are monitoring our key business metrics, which we believe are leading indicators of the macro economy impacting our business. We are not seeing these metrics soften across the customer base. For example, our corporate sales team that addresses small and medium-sized businesses outperformed their net new bookings goal for the quarter. Our EMEA sales team contributed 4 of our top 10 new customer wins in the quarter. And as mentioned earlier, the largest organizations in the world continue to increase their use of Snowflake. These indicate that companies globally are prioritizing Snowflake right now. Foreign currency exposure has been a relevant topic recently. However, less than 5% of our revenue is invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. So at the moment, we do not evaluate our business on a constant currency basis given the immateriality. Now, turning to margins on a non-GAAP basis. Our product gross margin was 75%. Scale in our public cloud data centers and enterprise customer success contribute to the year-over-year gross margin improvement. Operating margin was 4%, benefiting from revenue outperformance. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 12%, positively impacted by strong collections. We collected a $33 million invoice in Q2 from a customer who had paid its invoices in Q3 in prior years. We ended the quarter in a strong cash position with approximately $5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Now, let\u2019s turn to our guidance. For the third quarter, we expect product revenue between $500 million and $505 million, representing year-over-year growth between 60% and 62%. I would like to remind everyone that in Q3 last year, we saw unusual seasonality due to reaccelerated product revenue growth. Turning to margins. We expect on a non-GAAP basis, 2% operating margin and we expect 358 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. In Q3, we expect $4 million of expenses associated with our Data Cloud World Tour. The 21 events will take place around the world and showcase our latest innovations. For the full year of fiscal 2023, we expect product revenues between $1.905 billion and $1.915 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 67% and 68%. Turning to profitability for the full year of fiscal 2023, we expect on a non-GAAP basis, approximately 75% product gross margin, 2% operating margin and 17% adjusted free cash flow margin, and we expect 358 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The full year outlook includes operating expenses related to the acquisition of Applica. We are adding headcount to support our growth initiatives. Year-to-date, we have added almost 1,000 net new employees. We view the current hiring market as favorable for Snowflake and have not altered our hiring plans for the year. Our long-term opportunity is stronger than it has ever been and we look forward to executing. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: Yes, thank you very much. I am looking at the sequential growth in the product revenue, which is very strong. It\u2019s almost twice as strong as it was in Q1. So I am curious, first, if you think analytics and data-intensive projects might be an insulated area of activity during an economic slowdown. And just relatedly, are you seeing many customers consume at higher levels to try to analyze the changing macro, maybe looking at FX sensitivity or interest rate sensitivity, etcetera?\nFrank Slootman: Hey, Mark, it\u2019s Frank. In general, I would say that Snowflake gets prioritized fairly high inside the enterprise. And the reason is we are sitting right on the intersection of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced analytics. Customers are \u2013 they have picked up the center of the opportunity that is in front of them and they are investing, they are hiring, they are buying, because these are things that are going to be big changes for the industry. The whole industries are going to get redefined in healthcare, in pharma, in financial services. So this is not a business as usual. Let\u2019s try to hit the brakes. There is a very, very high urgency around advancing towards cloud computing environments and then having an opportunity to really pursue the promise that it brings. We are living at a very, very exciting times where things are becoming possible that we couldn\u2019t even dream of just a few short years ago. So, this is why we feel that this is not one of those expenses that people are going to casually cutback on, because it\u2019s strategically compelling and important.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. I will also add, Mark, just to remind, this is a consumption model, not a SaaS model. So even if we sign up a customer, it takes some months before they go into production. As I mentioned, there was a Global 2000 technology company. We signed in the last 2 years. It\u2019s now one of our top 10 customers. That customer didn\u2019t start really ramping until the end of last year and they are going to continue to ramp and there is many more that started ramping this quarter that we would have signed last quarter. So you can\u2019t just do a quarter-over-quarter. And because it is a consumption model, we do see patterns. Some customers do go down consumption based upon specific projects. But by and large, most of our customers are still ramping, moving workloads to us. And we think that is going to continue on average with our customers.\nMark Murphy: Wonderful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions. This is Sanjit Singh for Keith. Very impressive Q2. Mike, I want to talk to \u2013 I wanted to ask you a little bit about the Q3 guide. From a seasonal perspective, the high-end sort of implies 8% growth and understanding that last year was an abnormally strong seasonal quarter. If I look back historically, the guidance does seem more conservative than usual. I wonder if you could provide any context in terms of what you are assuming going into Q3 just conservatism or extrapolating any sort of trends that you may have seen in July?\nMike Scarpelli: Nothing has changed in our guidance philosophy since the time we went public. And what I would say is Q3 of last year was unusually high. So it\u2019s not a good year-over-year comparison. And as I said there is uncertainties in the macro environment right now, and I think the guidance is prudent that we put out.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see what your take is on your suppliers of public cloud capacity and whether or not you are seeing any changing in how they work with you and your pricing? And really, what is the criteria to pick one over another AWS versus Google versus Azure? Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: This is Frank. I think that most enterprises typically decide first on their public cloud platform strategy. And oftentimes, it\u2019s a multi-cloud posture and over time, that can also change. And then they sort of decide on, okay, where Snowflake going to run and that can also change over time. We have seen customers also deploy Snowflake on one-on-one cloud. So that\u2019s sort of how it works. And obviously, our pricing does vary. I mean, Snowflake is more expensive on one cloud than another. And obviously, it\u2019s the most aggressive pricing we have is on our top cloud providers where we have to have these concentration of deployment. So obviously, it matters to our customers, it all translates to dollars and cents. But the reality is Snowflake is Snowflake is Snowflake. There is really no change in the experience depending on what clouds you are running on. So you would think that it is strictly an economic trade-off, but it\u2019s usually predicated by why they picked one public cloud platform over another.\nMike Scarpelli: With that said, the majority of our customers, 80% plus run in AWS and about 18% is Azure and 2% is GCP.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much for that detail.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, maybe just a high level mix with a tactical financial question. If I look at the environment right a lot of investors, a lot of customers are wondering about optimizations. And I think on the call, Mike, in your script, you mentioned that you actually have changed \u2013 you have increased the prediction of how much will be consumed in reference to your CRPO metric over the next 12 months. So it feels like there is some \u2013 there is kind of a mass differential in terms of expectations versus what you are seeing in delivering. And I just wanted to better understand what\u2019s driving that increased conviction around consumption. Have you seen a meaningful wave of optimizations that have rebased and now you are kind off to the races in those workloads? Do you not anticipate that occurring? And I guess how is that \u2013 like what were the dynamics that made you change those assumptions that you saw in the quarter?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I didn\u2019t change any assumptions in the quarter. It\u2019s the same that we have had for quite some time. Optimizations are not something that\u2019s new. We just started talking to about them and showing the impact about them. We have always done optimizations. We will continue to do optimization. They are good for our customers because when they see, if we can help make them use Snowflake more efficiently, we become cheaper, they move more workloads to us. And I showed you guys at our Financial Analyst Day real data with two customers around that. With regards to the CRPO that 57% of the total RPO, that is more of a function that \u2013 we have a lot of our contracts that are starting to get burned down that were multiyear that we do expect in Q4 there will be a number of renewals of those contracts. So I do think the current CRPO as a percent of the total in Q4 will come down more in line with that into the low 50s where it historically has been. But that\u2019s really a function of \u2013 think of our largest customer. They signed a 3-year contract. And I think it was September of 2020 that they are going to burn through that contract in advance, and there will be a big renewal with them whether they do it 1-year or multiyear, that\u2019s up to them. That will happen in our Q4. And then you\u2019ll see that as well. We have a number of customers like that. One of the things that we\u2019re seeing more and more is customers, because they are consuming faster than their annual amount in their actual contract term, they are doing what we\u2019re calling co-term or they are bridging to their annual renewal. And a lot of those annual renewals are really moving towards Q4 for us.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. That\u2019s why the billings delta billings versus CRPO delta is a little bit higher?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I have to tell you, I don\u2019t even look at billings because it\u2019s a meaningless thing for our business because we\u2019re not a SaaS company. We\u2019re really focus more on cash flow and revenue consumption by our customers.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Quick question. I\u2019m sure Frank and Mike, you heard all the concern from investors this quarter about consumption models and how in lower economic activities has left. But I\u2019m also seeing like the 12 new global customers. What are you seeing in your customer conversations about consumption models in terms of like it gives customers more flexibility to pay for what they are using, etcetera? So then almost in tougher times, should be an incentive to go that way rather than having this massive upfront commitment. Like maybe talk a little bit on what you\u2019re seeing in the field. Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: Raimo, it\u2019s Frank. I mean, we sort of invert that whole way of thinking because it\u2019s actually quite attractive for customers to have a consumption model because they can sign a contract with us, but then they can throttle up and down, how much they want to use. You can\u2019t do that in a SaaS model, you\u2019re going to pay no matter what whether you\u2019re using it or not. So this gives customers actually more confidence to contract with us knowing that they can throttle up and down. So we actually think it\u2019s an advantage in the type of times that we\u2019re living in as opposed to a negative, which is what it has been for trade on the sell side and in the media.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. I\u2019ll add to that, too, Raimo. As a reminder, new customers when we land them, they generally start very small, and it takes some 9 months to really start to consume. So it\u2019s very low risk to come on. And once we have an existing customer that is looking to buy more, they have already have a path for what they want to do workloads, and they want to do that on Snowflake because we will save them money from what they are doing. And the other thing I want to remind you, too, is we have many different models. You can sign a 1-year commitment, you can sign a 3-year commitment, or you can go on to on-demand as a customer if you\u2019re not comfortable making a big commitment upfront. And we do see customers I think last quarter about $7.2 million of our revenue was actually on-demand. These are new customers that are just trying us out before they sign a capacity deal. And that\u2019s most of our capacity deals start from being on-demand to go to that.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you. Well done.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please proceed.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Frank, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the feedback you got from partners, both GSIs and ICVs coming away from your user conference. And kind of what are they asking you about in terms of making or telling you about rather in terms of making bigger investments in Snowflake and maybe some of the takeaways you had in terms of \u2013 as you setup your own go-to-market, not only for the remainder of the year, but into next year? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. I think the conference was an extraordinary display of our ecosystem. We had a partner and it was the size of multiple football fields and I think we\u2019re punching way above our weight in terms of how vibrant and how large and how active our ecosystem is. And it\u2019s a very purposeful choice on our part to run the company that way. We\u2019re not trying to create a single vertically integrated stack where you have to buy all things Snowflake. We do quite the opposite. We would try to create maximum choice and innovation on our platform. So we really become market and channel, if you will, for system integrators. The reality in the world of system integrators is Snowflake\u2019s presence in the marketplace is obviously forcing your hand, because our customers are their customers, and vice versa. We intercept in the marketplace, and their customers are expecting them to be able to step up and then deliver high-value, impactful capabilities on Snowflake. So they are growing leaps and bounds, but sometimes they are more following than leading. So that\u2019s why Snowflake is always leading and the other rest of the world is following.\nMike Scarpelli: Just to give you a little data around the GSI network. In the first half of this year, the GSIs have done north of $550 million in services around Snowflake. Our top five GSIs represented more than $320 million of that work. These are real practices within these GSIs now. And just on another thing, because I know there is been some chatter about resellers and other things, I just want to make it very clear. 1% of our bookings in Q2 went through the resale channel. 2% of our product revenue goes through resellers. So resellers is not a significant amount of our direct business. But the GSIs are very helpful in doing the services work to get customers to consume on Snowflake.\nKirk Materne: Thank you all.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.\nBrad Reback: Hi, thanks very much. Mike, I know you mentioned the 3Q consumption comp. You also have a really, really difficult 4Q RPO comp. But given your commentary, should we expect a healthy end to the year given that renewal pool? Thanks.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. We expect we will have a big increase in RPO. But I\u2019m not guiding to it. You\u2019ll have to wait and see. I\u2019m never going to guide RPO.\nBrad Reback: Understood. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. Wanted to drill down into Europe, that\u2019s been an area where we saw large deal delays with other large software companies. It sounds like \u2013 is there opportunity for you? You closed several large deals. So, maybe if you could just talk about the demand environment in Europe right now and what\u2019s driving some of the momentum for you that perhaps is a little different than some of the peers? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: Yes, Brent, it\u2019s Frank. We\u2019ve really shifted gears in Europe in terms of moving \u2013 not so much moving away, but sort of really emphasizing the large iconic accounts in key verticals, and obviously, in the top regions and countries. And that\u2019s really how you win markets over there. And that redirection has taken us a little bit of time. And we lost this last quarter that we just reported on. We\u2019ve seen some significant impact, and we made one comment during the prepared remarks about how they contributed some very, very large customers to the overall portfolio so to the overall roster. So we\u2019re actually feeling good about the progress we\u2019re making in Europe in the large names in the key verticals. So I think it\u2019s going good. The macro commentary, it\u2019s probably we\u2019re not really feeling a lot of \u2013 sort of headwinds, if you will, in Europe. Obviously, there are pockets of the wave, the farther east you go, the more you feel it, but that\u2019s really not what we were to begin with. So it\u2019s not really a factor. So we\u2019re not negative on Europe at all.\nBrent Bracelin: Great to see. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please proceed.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay, thank you for taking the question. Another software vendor that primarily has a consumption-based model recently made the comment that their NRR for customers below the 130% threshold has been unchanged, but those above 130% have been slowing their consumption growth since it deviates a lot from what had been budgeted or committed. Now your overall NRR this quarter again was quite strong guys, but I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen any of this dynamic with your bigger enterprise customers. Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: No. Obviously, there are some of our top 10, and we talked about last quarter with some specific things to their business where they have slowed down and that\u2019s been in our guidance. But overall, our top customers continue to grow. And I\u2019ve not seeing that slowing down NRR.\nGregg Moskowitz: Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please proceed.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you. And let me offer my congratulations on this quarter. Frank, can you take a minute to differentiate Snowflake\u2019s approach to the market from that of Databricks and their lake house approach?\nFrank Slootman: I mean, one of the ways we characterize it is sort of \u2013 historically, Snowflake has been a data lake with its own platform, its own proprietary platform and so on, whereas Databricks has taken the approach that they are just another tool and the like, so you can use many including them. So we were a far more strategic choice customers to commit to them in a much more tactical choice of just being a tool in the lake. Over the years, we have really converged because \u2013 for example, we mentioned in the prepared remarks of our support of the Iceberg open table formats which allows Snowflake files to be used by non-Snowflake tools, for example, right? So it really puts us completely on par or better, if you will, in terms of functionality and performance in a pure data lake configuration. But customers can also use this in the conventional, traditional, highly optimized Snowflake proprietary format that most people are using. So I think that \u2013 so that\u2019s one aspect of it. The other aspect of it is we come from different places, our DNA, our culture as a company as a database platform. And obviously, Databricks comes from a totally different type of background. We also have different user types. We have a very much high-level approach, we have a very much democratize access to the sophistication of a platform like Snowflake or Databricks coming from the world that\u2019s much more rolling around and very, very deep technical, very skilled demand type of environment. And there is a market for that as well. So there is different user types, different workloads that were \u2013 people will use different type of tools. The last thing I will say about is that de facto Databricks and Snowflake have lived side-by-side for many, many, many years, playing different roles in the setups and the type of workloads that they perform. So anything you want to say about that, Christian?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. One quick comment on everything Frank said. We hear very consistently from customers that our approach to simplicity and ease of use is one of the reasons why \u2013 you see the results that you\u2019re seeing today and the Net Promoter Score that Frank mentioned, because we help customers focus on solving data problems, getting value out of the data and not deal with the infrastructure.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kamil Mielczarek with William Blair. Please proceed.\nKamil Mielczarek: Thanks. Congrats on the solid quarter. The headcount growth in your sales and marketing organization has exceeded 50% in the first half of this year, which is comfortably above the growth rate you in both fiscal \u201821 and \u201822. Can you provide more detail on where you\u2019ve been focusing the new investments? And given the macro uncertainty, how do you think about the time to ramp \u2013 how long should it take for the new hires to be fully reflected in revenue? Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, the first half of the year is always the biggest hiring, and that tends to be we want to get people on board for our sales kickoff. It\u2019s also when we like to onboard a lot of our junior SDRs so we can train them altogether in the year. But the people we\u2019re adding are principally in direct sales and sales engineers, and we continue to open up new countries around the world. But we\u2019re going a lot deeper within North America as well, too, because there still is a lot of accounts that are being covered today. And it takes, depending on where they are in the corporate sales team, which is more of an inside sale, it\u2019s about a 6-month period to ramp. It\u2019s a little bit longer around the enterprise and the verticals. The real large verticals we go after those guys could take a year to ramp because those are long sales cycles.\nKamil Mielczarek: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen. Please proceed.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter. [Technical Difficulty]\nMike Scarpelli: Derrick, we can\u2019t hear you very well. You\u2019re cutting in and out. Could you repeat that maybe?\nDerrick Wood: Is this better? Can you hear me now?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes.\nDerrick Wood: I wanted to ask about the \u2013 just the activity of migrating customers from legacy on-prem systems. And I think you\u2019ve shown stats that close to 60% of your new customers come from that environment. And given the macro out there, some would argue you\u2019d see acceleration because of operational efficiencies, some would argue maybe there is a lot of change management and companies would want to hold off. But just curious what you\u2019re seeing out of your pipeline in terms of the prospects priority to migrate off of on-prem systems.\nFrank Slootman: I\u2019ll make one comment. I mean, I will tell you that just in the last week, I\u2019ve heard some two very, very iconic names in two different industries that were staunch on-premise people who would never ever go cloud and that are now going. So I just feel that the resistance is completely breaking and people are going cloud. I\u2019m sure they have their own reasons. But a lot of this is what you said as well is that they are \u2013 they are going to get left behind. You can\u2019t take advantage of innovations that are only available on the cloud. So if anything, I can to agree with you that we\u2019re going to see acceleration out of this as opposed to people holding back.\nDerrick Wood: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Congrats guys had a really strong quarter and navigating crazy environment out there. My question for you guys, maybe for Frank, is, I mean, if we think about just Data Cloud is the Holy Grail and data sharing being a really important element of that, and I look to the metric on stable edges, number of customers with at least one stable edge. I think it was 20%, you said, versus 15% a year ago, which I think is unchanged from what you had also said in Q1. Can you just give us a sense of how you would expect to see that progress? And when we look back 1 day, maybe where might the peak be? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: I think there is a natural progression in these things. As you said, lots of people are preoccupied with the migration. That takes a lot of time. There is a lot of risk. There is a lot of \u2013 so people want to get their core capabilities in place. They want to deal with their backlog, all the things that they need to do before they sort of move on to more aggressive, more ambitious projects where they are really starting to execute on their strategies and the vision that they have for themselves. So, I think that the Data Cloud is an incredibly important positioning element for us, but also for our customers. Because if you don\u2019t adopt that posture, you will end up re-siloing your environment in the cloud, and you will basically load up on the same set of problems that we historically have had. And it\u2019s a much bigger problem now because data science and the promise of data science, the ability to generate predictive insights and prescriptive solutions really depends on your ability to join and blend and overlay data regardless of data types, data source of where it\u2019s coming from. You can\u2019t predict. So, it\u2019s really, really important that you don\u2019t throw up new barriers between data sources because you will not only frustrate your data science teams, you will literally not be able to realize the potential that is now there. So, we draw a line in the sand on that. If you are going to go silo-by-silo, then you will be on the cloud, which you will not have set yourself up for the promise that\u2019s now in front of us.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Will Power with Baird. Please proceed.\nWill Power: Great. Thanks for taking the question and again, congratulations on the strong numbers. It looks like really strong up-market success. I think a record number of $1 million or at least new $1 million customers. I just wanted to get more color, if there are any common variables helping drive that up-market success? It sounds like there is a correlation with data sharing, the percentage of those customers that are deploying stable edges. So, any further color on that from you that would be great too?\nFrank Slootman: It\u2019s Frank again. I think what Mike said earlier, I mean a lot of these million-dollar accounts can be years in the making. And a lot of the work that we have done in previous years is now culminating and it\u2019s becoming visible in this particular manner. So, it\u2019s not an overnight success. These things take time. But data sharing is incredibly important. Every industry and sub-industry has its own unique data networks and their own reasons and use cases where we know why they need to share data. I knew financial services, for example, which is of course, an industry that you are all very familiar with. I mean the need for sharing is extremely pronounced and it\u2019s a daily preoccupation between institutions that need to share data. So, Snowflake has really become a de facto platform for financial institutions on how to share data. So, that becomes a very, very powerful thing. We feel the network effect from data sharing in certain verticals that are really more advanced, more mature in terms of the adoption of data sharing than some others that are taking more time to get into that.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. And what I will add, too, is we have 510 Global 2000 customers. The average revenue from them today is $1.2 million. That\u2019s up from $1.050 million last quarter, and that will continue to grow. Those large customers, what is driving those million dollar plus customers for us, and we don\u2019t see that slowing down.\nWill Power: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Please proceed.\nDJ Hynes: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I wanted to ask you about the margin trajectory of the business, I mean continue to impress with the cash flow operating leverage you are showing. You raised the guidance to 17% this year guide. Given the trajectory, we are not miles off from that longer term 25% target. What was the philosophy from here? Like do we reinvest the growth and the upside that we are seeing into the business to drive sales, productivity and accelerated investment there, or did some of that flow through the bottom line, and maybe that 25% margin target is achievable ahead of schedule?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, we are going to get to that number before we even think about changing it. And with regards to investing in the business, we are continuing to invest in the business. You can see the headcount we are adding. Principally, headcount is the main investment we are doing in the business because that\u2019s what drives R&D, that\u2019s what drives sale. But we are very thoughtful about where we invest those dollars and how quick we do. And we think we are investing at the adequate pace, and we will continue with that. And nothing has changed in our philosophy. We will continue to show leverage year-after-year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nBrent Thill: Thanks Frank and Mike. On verticals, were there some standouts this quarter? We have heard energy has been a hot topic, just as an example. Any other big verticals you would call out that you saw a particular strength that you are excited by?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. Energy is not a very big vertical for it. Yes, we have some good customers, but they are not huge consumers of Snowflake. Really financial services is the number one vertical. It\u2019s about \u2013 if you look at it from a revenue perspective, about 20%, 21% of our revenue is from the financial services vertical, and then closely behind that is the media and entertainment, and technology is right after that as well, about the same. Those are our three biggest. And then health care is pretty big, but it can grow a lot bigger.\nFrank Slootman: Retail CPG.\nMike Scarpelli: Retail CPG is a meaningful segment as well. But financial services is very large, and those are very large stable edges, the data sharing that goes on in financial services. And when we talk about big accounts we landed in Europe, a big telco. We landed a big bank. We landed a big insurance company and we continue to land big accounts in these verticals.\nBrent Thill: Okay. And one quick follow-up. Just on you have seen Salesforce.com take down guidance looked on takedown guide. Everyone is asking, it seems like the industry is taking that guide down, but you are seeing incredible strength and no stretch on deals or duration. What do you think is going on? Are you just taking share? Is it just early on? How would you characterize what you are seeing\u2026?\nMike Scarpelli: I would say, most SaaS companies when they land an account. They typically license most of the users in an account. When we land, we land small, and they go workload-by-workload and they just keep moving stuff over to Snowflake that drives that. And it\u2019s a multiyear journey within our customers. And I don\u2019t see any of our customers that are fully saturated. Well, I think some SaaS companies may be saturated.\nBrent Thill: Very clear. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Steve Koenig with SMBC. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys. This is Owen here on for Steve. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick related questions from us. First, you described the near-term opportunity and analytics beyond your core data warehouse use case? And which of these other workloads would you expect to become most prevalent in the near-term? And then as a second, I am wondering if you can talk through the plans to break into the operational use cases. And how many times bigger is that market opportunity in the near-term compared to that heritage EDW market? Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: It\u2019s Frank, I will make one comment. And I will give Christian some time to think about some additional comments. We started out in this business with what I have referred to as a workload modernization, where we are taking existing workloads and move them to the cloud. And we are running them much faster because of all the architectural innovations that Snowflake has represented. And this really helps customers. And I mentioned this in the prepared remarks, it really helped customers a 24-hour cycle to very reliably deliver data to their business users. And that\u2019s been a long time coming. The customers have struggled with that enormously. And then we hear about it every single day. But that\u2019s just reporting yesterday\u2019s news. And these days, I will tell you that 9 out of 10 conversations I had with customers are not about that, okay. They are about very specific industry challenges and industry opportunities. For example, we have pharma customers that are seeing opportunities to reduce their clinical trials, it takes on average 12 years to bring a drug to market. You have got 5 years left to monetize it. They can take a whole year off for that. You redefine the economics of an entire industry. Healthcare is trying to go to an entirely predictive model, let\u2019s say, treating people for disease. They are trying to predict who is going to get sick and what provide protocols they can put in place to help people then steer clear that. So, these are very different conversations than what we are doing. In advertising, for example, with clean room technologies, we are doing totally different things now, and we are enabling these industries to navigate all the issues around privacy and compliance and so on. So, to characterize this as a data warehousing company, I have said this a million time, but that is probably 5 years out of the day by now. And you can keep doing that, but that doesn\u2019t make it the reality of our business because it\u2019s not anymore.\nChristian Kleinerman: I will add that we see broadening the personas within a company that we speak to. It\u2019s not just the traditional data analyst team, but data engineering team are engaged with us, data scientists are engaged with us. Streamlit has a really strong relationship with many of the data science teams, and we see that part of it. We announced at our user conference in June, Cybersecurity is a workload that is doing very well for us. And probably the largest announcement was around Snowflake for data applications and an application platform. That\u2019s where the opportunity for the operational database capabilities fit into, and we see tremendous interest on both customers and partners.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. And just a quick follow-up, Snowflake has become de facto a cloud application development and the run time platform. People are building and deploying applications on Snowflake. I mean we have customers like Western Union who were starting whole businesses on top of Snowflake. Those are the conversations that we are having with customers. Workload modernization, we will be doing that until the end of time, but that\u2019s no longer the reality that dominates our daily existence.\nUnidentified Analyst: Super helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks and a nice quarter. Mike, I wanted to piggyback to a comment you made earlier that it takes months for customers to get into production even after they sign up with you. I guess with that being the case in the current environment being what it is, what is the risk that 6 months to 12 months from now, we will see a little bit of a lull in your growth as whatever slowdown in activity that\u2019s happening with them right now translates into a smaller number of workload transitions into the cloud. How much visibility do you have into the prep work customers are doing with respect to the workload transition?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, we have a lot of that. You can see in the number of CAP 1s that we landed last quarter. It was north of 600. All of those customers, they signed up on Snowflake to move workloads to us. And we know, based upon discussions we have with many of our top customers, their plans, what we are planning on doing. As an example, we have a number of our customers that are just chomping at the bit for Snowpark to go into GA with Python because they want to do more on Snowflake. So, that\u2019s what gives us the confidence. And we spend a lot of time looking and engaging with our reps. We are talking to our customers to get a feel for what is consumption going to be like over the next three months, six months with our customers.\nFrank Slootman: Just a quick follow-up, I actually think the dynamic that you are describing. I mean we are going to see the exact opposite of that. We think people because of the nervousness that they may have about the macro, they are going to accelerate to a cloud computing platform. And the reason is these are elastic models. These are consumption models, right. So, it\u2019s much better to be in the elastic model where you only pay for what you use, and you can run on demand then when you have to make large upfront commitments to vendors. So, if anything, I think people are going to get a move on instead of hold off.\nIttai Kidron: Good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research. Please proceed.\nAri Terjanian: Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the great results. You alluded to earlier referring on Snowpark and Python\u2019s support. I was just hoping if you could provide a little bit more color on the feedback you are getting from customers around Python, for Snowpark, as well as the announcements you made around Apache at the user conference. Curious, when you think those can start to drive consumption for the platform when you are expecting contribution and what types of projects that you are currently not involved in, what kind of use cases it could open up for you?\nFrank Slootman: Yes, I will start, and maybe Christian can finish. Python is \u2013 so Snowflake for Python is red hot, and people are jumping that for us to declare it GA, which is something and we have customers that are really wanting us to let them use it in production now some of the largest customers that we have. So, pressure is on because the demand is there. The thing about the Iceberg Open Table formats that really completely open Snowflake up to be \u2013 for Snowflake cables to be used by anybody and everybody that can support that format. We are seeing incredible results in terms of performance of like executing against that file format. So, these are all very, very, very promising developments for us. And I think that the pressure is on for us to declare these things generally available because people are trying to rip them out of our hands right now.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. As we said at our Summit conference, we expect those to be GA at the end of this year. So, a meaningful contribution to consumption will happen next year.\nChristian Kleinerman: That\u2019s right. And qualitatively, the feedback is extremely positive, which is why, as Frank said, we get this many requests to go production go GA as soon as we can.\nAri Terjanian: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: The question will come from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed.\nTyler Radke: Thank you. So, we made it almost a full hour without talking about Graviton. I actually just wanted to ask you how you are thinking about new projects or new workloads in response to some of the optimizations. And any change to your assumptions? I think you had talked about kind of $60 million of net new spend coming online. Just curious how that\u2019s tracking and your expectations for the second half of the year? Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: No changes to our assumptions there. And we always expect that the biggest impact is in the second half of the year on those? And then Christian?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. We are always continuously looking at how to deliver price performance advantage to our customers. Graviton happened to be one of the more significant changes. But any quarter, we have tens of changes that go and improve performance for different workloads. And we are also constantly evaluating hardware management and our commitment to our customers is to do that research and that we have and deliver the best price performance.\nTyler Radke: And if I could sneak in a quick follow-up, I guess just what type of workloads are you seeing customers bring on with those lower price points? Is it kind of new workload that you weren\u2019t able to handle in the past just any way to characterize that? Thank you.\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. We are seeing a lot of lower latency, higher concurrency use cases, like lighting and liking, we did our migration from Drewry, which is very related to use cases recently. In part because of the better economics, but in part because of the performance, and they are obviously \u2013 it\u2019s highly correlated. We are also seeing a lot of data engineering, data transformation, smart migrations coming on to Snowflake, all because of the price performance that we offer.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session, as well as today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

We are seeing a lot of lower latency, higher concurrency use cases, like lighting and liking, we did our migration from Drewry, which is very related to use cases recently. In part because of the better economics, but in part because of the performance, and they are obviously \u2013 it's highly correlated. We are also seeing a lot of data engineering, data transformation, smart migrations coming on to Snowflake, all because of the price performance that we offer."

            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks, Jimmy and good afternoon everybody. Product revenue grew 83% year-on-year to $466 million. Remaining performance obligations grew 78% year-on-year to $2.7 billion and in the quarter, we added 12 Global 2000 customers. Our net revenue retention rate exceeded 170% and Snowflake leads the industry with a net promoter score of 72. Snowflake is delivering high growth and operating leverage. Non-GAAP product gross margin exceeded 75% and we continue to generate non-GAAP operating income and free cash flow. Our success is fueled by broad-based workload enablement. The core idea behind the Snowflake Data Cloud is to enable work to come to the data and prevent data from having to be moved to the work. Previously, data was copied, transferred and replicated to be used wherever it was processed. That led to massive operational complexity, cost and governance risks. The Snowflake Data Cloud promises to bring that regrettable legacy to an end. Starting in 2014, Snowflake's cloud native architecture removed the scale, performance and economic bottlenecks that held back data analytics at scale for generations. The impact was immediate and led to a major expansion of workloads and use cases. Initially, organizations use Snowflake to drastically improve overnight analytical processes so that fresh up-to-date data about the business was reliably available first thing. Checking that box, customers move on to using data for predictive insights and prescriptive solutions. This is what has driven Snowflake's massive platform expansion in terms of workload types, user types and data types. Snowflake's data sharing solves the challenge of data access and enrichment. In Q2, the number of Snowflake data sharing relationships measured with what we call stable edges grew 112% year-on-year. 21% of our growing customer base has at least one stable edge, up from 15% a year ago. Among customers over $1 million in product revenue, 65% have at least one stable edge. Across sectors, we are meeting customers with solutions pertinent to their vertical industries. For example, supply chain management realized in Snowflake's combination of execution and access. We hear how supply chain management is failing at many levels because of dislocations such as the pandemic and spiking inflation. This is, in large part, a data problem. The data originates in different places, which is why it was such a challenging time coming together. And the world is stable and changing marginally day-to-day, this has been somewhat tolerable. Now with massive disruption in the status quo must change. Our next frontier of innovation is aimed at reinventing cloud application development. Our ambition is far reaching. Our aim is to transform how cloud applications are built, deployed, sold and transacted. To help achieve this, we launched our Powered by Snowflake program. Today, we have 590 Powered by Snowflake registrants, representing 35% quarter-over-quarter growth. We announced a number of significant product innovations at our Summit Users Conference in June, which saw an approximate fivefold increase in attendance from 2019. These announcements are foundational for that vision. Unistore allows developers to bridge transactional and analytical workloads in a single dataset to save users' time and effort associated with moving and transforming data across systems. Snowpark for Python is now in public preview. This capability brings more optionality to a technical audience of application developers, data engineers and data scientists. Our integration with the recently acquired Streamlit is tracking well against plan. Streamlit bridges the gap between data scientists and business users, accelerating time to insight by enabling developers to build applications using their favorite tools. Finally, we announced support for Apache Iceberg table formats in private preview. Iceberg is the emerging standard for data lake architectures. With this offering, we bring the performance and governance benefits of Snowflake to externally stored data. We are pleased to announce our intent to acquire Applica. Applica mobilizes unstructured data for advanced analytics and machine learning. Applica's team and best-in-class technology will create opportunities for customers and partners to get more value from all data types. We believe our strategy and underlying market trends position us for success. We look forward to executing against this growing opportunity. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Hey, Mark, it's Frank. In general, I would say that Snowflake gets prioritized fairly high inside the enterprise. And the reason is we are sitting right on the intersection of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced analytics. Customers are \u2013 they have picked up the center of the opportunity that is in front of them and they are investing, they are hiring, they are buying, because these are things that are going to be big changes for the industry. The whole industries are going to get redefined in healthcare, in pharma, in financial services. So this is not a business as usual. Let's try to hit the brakes. There is a very, very high urgency around advancing towards cloud computing environments and then having an opportunity to really pursue the promise that it brings. We are living at a very, very exciting times where things are becoming possible that we couldn't even dream of just a few short years ago. So, this is why we feel that this is not one of those expenses that people are going to casually cutback on, because it's strategically compelling and important. This is Frank. I think that most enterprises typically decide first on their public cloud platform strategy. And oftentimes, it's a multi-cloud posture and over time, that can also change. And then they sort of decide on, okay, where Snowflake going to run and that can also change over time. We have seen customers also deploy Snowflake on one-on-one cloud. So that's sort of how it works. And obviously, our pricing does vary. I mean, Snowflake is more expensive on one cloud than another. And obviously, it's the most aggressive pricing we have is on our top cloud providers where we have to have these concentration of deployment. So obviously, it matters to our customers, it all translates to dollars and cents. But the reality is Snowflake is Snowflake is Snowflake. There is really no change in the experience depending on what clouds you are running on. So you would think that it is strictly an economic trade-off, but it's usually predicated by why they picked one public cloud platform over another. Raimo, it's Frank. I mean, we sort of invert that whole way of thinking because it's actually quite attractive for customers to have a consumption model because they can sign a contract with us, but then they can throttle up and down, how much they want to use. You can't do that in a SaaS model, you're going to pay no matter what whether you're using it or not. So this gives customers actually more confidence to contract with us knowing that they can throttle up and down. So we actually think it's an advantage in the type of times that we're living in as opposed to a negative, which is what it has been for trade on the sell side and in the media. Yes. I think the conference was an extraordinary display of our ecosystem. We had a partner and it was the size of multiple football fields and I think we're punching way above our weight in terms of how vibrant and how large and how active our ecosystem is. And it's a very purposeful choice on our part to run the company that way. We're not trying to create a single vertically integrated stack where you have to buy all things Snowflake. We do quite the opposite. We would try to create maximum choice and innovation on our platform. So we really become market and channel, if you will, for system integrators. The reality in the world of system integrators is Snowflake's presence in the marketplace is obviously forcing your hand, because our customers are their customers, and vice versa. We intercept in the marketplace, and their customers are expecting them to be able to step up and then deliver high-value, impactful capabilities on Snowflake. So they are growing leaps and bounds, but sometimes they are more following than leading. So that's why Snowflake is always leading and the other rest of the world is following. Yes, Brent, it's Frank. We've really shifted gears in Europe in terms of moving \u2013 not so much moving away, but sort of really emphasizing the large iconic accounts in key verticals, and obviously, in the top regions and countries. And that's really how you win markets over there. And that redirection has taken us a little bit of time. And we lost this last quarter that we just reported on. We've seen some significant impact, and we made one comment during the prepared remarks about how they contributed some very, very large customers to the overall portfolio so to the overall roster. So we're actually feeling good about the progress we're making in Europe in the large names in the key verticals. So I think it's going good. The macro commentary, it's probably we're not really feeling a lot of \u2013 sort of headwinds, if you will, in Europe. Obviously, there are pockets of the wave, the farther east you go, the more you feel it, but that's really not what we were to begin with. So it's not really a factor. So we're not negative on Europe at all. I mean, one of the ways we characterize it is sort of \u2013 historically, Snowflake has been a data lake with its own platform, its own proprietary platform and so on, whereas Databricks has taken the approach that they are just another tool and the like, so you can use many including them. So we were a far more strategic choice customers to commit to them in a much more tactical choice of just being a tool in the lake. Over the years, we have really converged because \u2013 for example, we mentioned in the prepared remarks of our support of the Iceberg open table formats which allows Snowflake files to be used by non-Snowflake tools, for example, right? So it really puts us completely on par or better, if you will, in terms of functionality and performance in a pure data lake configuration. But customers can also use this in the conventional, traditional, highly optimized Snowflake proprietary format that most people are using. So I think that \u2013 so that's one aspect of it. The other aspect of it is we come from different places, our DNA, our culture as a company as a database platform. And obviously, Databricks comes from a totally different type of background. We also have different user types. We have a very much high-level approach, we have a very much democratize access to the sophistication of a platform like Snowflake or Databricks coming from the world that's much more rolling around and very, very deep technical, very skilled demand type of environment. And there is a market for that as well. So there is different user types, different workloads that were \u2013 people will use different type of tools. The last thing I will say about is that de facto Databricks and Snowflake have lived side-by-side for many, many, many years, playing different roles in the setups and the type of workloads that they perform. So anything you want to say about that, Christian? I'll make one comment. I mean, I will tell you that just in the last week, I've heard some two very, very iconic names in two different industries that were staunch on-premise people who would never ever go cloud and that are now going. So I just feel that the resistance is completely breaking and people are going cloud. I'm sure they have their own reasons. But a lot of this is what you said as well is that they are \u2013 they are going to get left behind. You can't take advantage of innovations that are only available on the cloud. So if anything, I can to agree with you that we're going to see acceleration out of this as opposed to people holding back. I think there is a natural progression in these things. As you said, lots of people are preoccupied with the migration. That takes a lot of time. There is a lot of risk. There is a lot of \u2013 so people want to get their core capabilities in place. They want to deal with their backlog, all the things that they need to do before they sort of move on to more aggressive, more ambitious projects where they are really starting to execute on their strategies and the vision that they have for themselves. So, I think that the Data Cloud is an incredibly important positioning element for us, but also for our customers. Because if you don't adopt that posture, you will end up re-siloing your environment in the cloud, and you will basically load up on the same set of problems that we historically have had. And it's a much bigger problem now because data science and the promise of data science, the ability to generate predictive insights and prescriptive solutions really depends on your ability to join and blend and overlay data regardless of data types, data source of where it's coming from. You can't predict. So, it's really, really important that you don't throw up new barriers between data sources because you will not only frustrate your data science teams, you will literally not be able to realize the potential that is now there. So, we draw a line in the sand on that. If you are going to go silo-by-silo, then you will be on the cloud, which you will not have set yourself up for the promise that's now in front of us. It's Frank again. I think what Mike said earlier, I mean a lot of these million-dollar accounts can be years in the making. And a lot of the work that we have done in previous years is now culminating and it's becoming visible in this particular manner. So, it's not an overnight success. These things take time. But data sharing is incredibly important. Every industry and sub-industry has its own unique data networks and their own reasons and use cases where we know why they need to share data. I knew financial services, for example, which is of course, an industry that you are all very familiar with. I mean the need for sharing is extremely pronounced and it's a daily preoccupation between institutions that need to share data. So, Snowflake has really become a de facto platform for financial institutions on how to share data. So, that becomes a very, very powerful thing. We feel the network effect from data sharing in certain verticals that are really more advanced, more mature in terms of the adoption of data sharing than some others that are taking more time to get into that. Retail CPG. It's Frank, I will make one comment. And I will give Christian some time to think about some additional comments. We started out in this business with what I have referred to as a workload modernization, where we are taking existing workloads and move them to the cloud. And we are running them much faster because of all the architectural innovations that Snowflake has represented. And this really helps customers. And I mentioned this in the prepared remarks, it really helped customers a 24-hour cycle to very reliably deliver data to their business users. And that's been a long time coming. The customers have struggled with that enormously. And then we hear about it every single day. But that's just reporting yesterday's news. And these days, I will tell you that 9 out of 10 conversations I had with customers are not about that, okay. They are about very specific industry challenges and industry opportunities. For example, we have pharma customers that are seeing opportunities to reduce their clinical trials, it takes on average 12 years to bring a drug to market. You have got 5 years left to monetize it. They can take a whole year off for that. You redefine the economics of an entire industry. Healthcare is trying to go to an entirely predictive model, let's say, treating people for disease. They are trying to predict who is going to get sick and what provide protocols they can put in place to help people then steer clear that. So, these are very different conversations than what we are doing. In advertising, for example, with clean room technologies, we are doing totally different things now, and we are enabling these industries to navigate all the issues around privacy and compliance and so on. So, to characterize this as a data warehousing company, I have said this a million time, but that is probably 5 years out of the day by now. And you can keep doing that, but that doesn't make it the reality of our business because it's not anymore. Just a quick follow-up, I actually think the dynamic that you are describing. I mean we are going to see the exact opposite of that. We think people because of the nervousness that they may have about the macro, they are going to accelerate to a cloud computing platform. And the reason is these are elastic models. These are consumption models, right. So, it's much better to be in the elastic model where you only pay for what you use, and you can run on demand then when you have to make large upfront commitments to vendors. So, if anything, I think people are going to get a move on instead of hold off. Yes, I will start, and maybe Christian can finish. Python is \u2013 so Snowflake for Python is red hot, and people are jumping that for us to declare it GA, which is something and we have customers that are really wanting us to let them use it in production now some of the largest customers that we have. So, pressure is on because the demand is there. The thing about the Iceberg Open Table formats that really completely open Snowflake up to be \u2013 for Snowflake cables to be used by anybody and everybody that can support that format. We are seeing incredible results in terms of performance of like executing against that file format. So, these are all very, very, very promising developments for us. And I think that the pressure is on for us to declare these things generally available because people are trying to rip them out of our hands right now."

            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Q2 product revenues were $466 million, representing 83% year-over-year growth and remaining performance obligations grew 78% year-over-year, totaling $2.7 billion. Of the $2.7 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 57% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. This represents a 79% increase compared to our estimate as of the same quarter last year. Our net revenue retention rate of 171% includes 15 new customers with $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue and reflects durable growth among our largest customers. We continue to pursue a vertical sales strategy. Our core verticals are financial services, advertising, media and entertainment, retail and CPG, technology and healthcare and life sciences. While all verticals are growing rapidly, financial services drove the most product revenue growth sequentially. Advertising, media and entertainment and technology verticals grew in line with the overall company. Driving this growth is our continual move up market. In the quarter, we added 12 new Global 2000 customers. Our average trailing 12-month product revenue from these customers grew 14% quarter-over-quarter to $1.2 million. We believe these accounts will grow to become our largest customers. A Global 2000 technology company is now a top 10 product revenue customer, less than 2 years after signing their initial deal. Last quarter, we called out customers that were negatively impacted by headwinds specific to their businesses. The Q2 results from these customers were mixed. Some saw the weakness we expected while others outperformed. We are monitoring our key business metrics, which we believe are leading indicators of the macro economy impacting our business. We are not seeing these metrics soften across the customer base. For example, our corporate sales team that addresses small and medium-sized businesses outperformed their net new bookings goal for the quarter. Our EMEA sales team contributed 4 of our top 10 new customer wins in the quarter. And as mentioned earlier, the largest organizations in the world continue to increase their use of Snowflake. These indicate that companies globally are prioritizing Snowflake right now. Foreign currency exposure has been a relevant topic recently. However, less than 5% of our revenue is invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. So at the moment, we do not evaluate our business on a constant currency basis given the immateriality. Now, turning to margins on a non-GAAP basis. Our product gross margin was 75%. Scale in our public cloud data centers and enterprise customer success contribute to the year-over-year gross margin improvement. Operating margin was 4%, benefiting from revenue outperformance. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 12%, positively impacted by strong collections. We collected a $33 million invoice in Q2 from a customer who had paid its invoices in Q3 in prior years. We ended the quarter in a strong cash position with approximately $5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Now, let's turn to our guidance. For the third quarter, we expect product revenue between $500 million and $505 million, representing year-over-year growth between 60% and 62%. I would like to remind everyone that in Q3 last year, we saw unusual seasonality due to reaccelerated product revenue growth. Turning to margins. We expect on a non-GAAP basis, 2% operating margin and we expect 358 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. In Q3, we expect $4 million of expenses associated with our Data Cloud World Tour. The 21 events will take place around the world and showcase our latest innovations. For the full year of fiscal 2023, we expect product revenues between $1.905 billion and $1.915 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 67% and 68%. Turning to profitability for the full year of fiscal 2023, we expect on a non-GAAP basis, approximately 75% product gross margin, 2% operating margin and 17% adjusted free cash flow margin, and we expect 358 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The full year outlook includes operating expenses related to the acquisition of Applica. We are adding headcount to support our growth initiatives. Year-to-date, we have added almost 1,000 net new employees. We view the current hiring market as favorable for Snowflake and have not altered our hiring plans for the year. Our long-term opportunity is stronger than it has ever been and we look forward to executing. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Yes. I will also add, Mark, just to remind, this is a consumption model, not a SaaS model. So even if we sign up a customer, it takes some months before they go into production. As I mentioned, there was a Global 2000 technology company. We signed in the last 2 years. It's now one of our top 10 customers. That customer didn't start really ramping until the end of last year and they are going to continue to ramp and there is many more that started ramping this quarter that we would have signed last quarter. So you can't just do a quarter-over-quarter. And because it is a consumption model, we do see patterns. Some customers do go down consumption based upon specific projects. But by and large, most of our customers are still ramping, moving workloads to us. And we think that is going to continue on average with our customers. Nothing has changed in our guidance philosophy since the time we went public. And what I would say is Q3 of last year was unusually high. So it's not a good year-over-year comparison. And as I said there is uncertainties in the macro environment right now, and I think the guidance is prudent that we put out. With that said, the majority of our customers, 80% plus run in AWS and about 18% is Azure and 2% is GCP. Well, I didn't change any assumptions in the quarter. It's the same that we have had for quite some time. Optimizations are not something that's new. We just started talking to about them and showing the impact about them. We have always done optimizations. We will continue to do optimization. They are good for our customers because when they see, if we can help make them use Snowflake more efficiently, we become cheaper, they move more workloads to us. And I showed you guys at our Financial Analyst Day real data with two customers around that. With regards to the CRPO that 57% of the total RPO, that is more of a function that \u2013 we have a lot of our contracts that are starting to get burned down that were multiyear that we do expect in Q4 there will be a number of renewals of those contracts. So I do think the current CRPO as a percent of the total in Q4 will come down more in line with that into the low 50s where it historically has been. But that's really a function of \u2013 think of our largest customer. They signed a 3-year contract. And I think it was September of 2020 that they are going to burn through that contract in advance, and there will be a big renewal with them whether they do it 1-year or multiyear, that's up to them. That will happen in our Q4. And then you'll see that as well. We have a number of customers like that. One of the things that we're seeing more and more is customers, because they are consuming faster than their annual amount in their actual contract term, they are doing what we're calling co-term or they are bridging to their annual renewal. And a lot of those annual renewals are really moving towards Q4 for us. Well, I have to tell you, I don't even look at billings because it's a meaningless thing for our business because we're not a SaaS company. We're really focus more on cash flow and revenue consumption by our customers. Yes. I'll add to that, too, Raimo. As a reminder, new customers when we land them, they generally start very small, and it takes some 9 months to really start to consume. So it's very low risk to come on. And once we have an existing customer that is looking to buy more, they have already have a path for what they want to do workloads, and they want to do that on Snowflake because we will save them money from what they are doing. And the other thing I want to remind you, too, is we have many different models. You can sign a 1-year commitment, you can sign a 3-year commitment, or you can go on to on-demand as a customer if you're not comfortable making a big commitment upfront. And we do see customers I think last quarter about $7.2 million of our revenue was actually on-demand. These are new customers that are just trying us out before they sign a capacity deal. And that's most of our capacity deals start from being on-demand to go to that. Just to give you a little data around the GSI network. In the first half of this year, the GSIs have done north of $550 million in services around Snowflake. Our top five GSIs represented more than $320 million of that work. These are real practices within these GSIs now. And just on another thing, because I know there is been some chatter about resellers and other things, I just want to make it very clear. 1% of our bookings in Q2 went through the resale channel. 2% of our product revenue goes through resellers. So resellers is not a significant amount of our direct business. But the GSIs are very helpful in doing the services work to get customers to consume on Snowflake. Yes. We expect we will have a big increase in RPO. But I'm not guiding to it. You'll have to wait and see. I'm never going to guide RPO. No. Obviously, there are some of our top 10, and we talked about last quarter with some specific things to their business where they have slowed down and that's been in our guidance. But overall, our top customers continue to grow. And I've not seeing that slowing down NRR. Well, the first half of the year is always the biggest hiring, and that tends to be we want to get people on board for our sales kickoff. It's also when we like to onboard a lot of our junior SDRs so we can train them altogether in the year. But the people we're adding are principally in direct sales and sales engineers, and we continue to open up new countries around the world. But we're going a lot deeper within North America as well, too, because there still is a lot of accounts that are being covered today. And it takes, depending on where they are in the corporate sales team, which is more of an inside sale, it's about a 6-month period to ramp. It's a little bit longer around the enterprise and the verticals. The real large verticals we go after those guys could take a year to ramp because those are long sales cycles. Derrick, we can't hear you very well. You're cutting in and out. Could you repeat that maybe? Yes. Yes. And what I will add, too, is we have 510 Global 2000 customers. The average revenue from them today is $1.2 million. That's up from $1.050 million last quarter, and that will continue to grow. Those large customers, what is driving those million dollar plus customers for us, and we don't see that slowing down. Well, we are going to get to that number before we even think about changing it. And with regards to investing in the business, we are continuing to invest in the business. You can see the headcount we are adding. Principally, headcount is the main investment we are doing in the business because that's what drives R&D, that's what drives sale. But we are very thoughtful about where we invest those dollars and how quick we do. And we think we are investing at the adequate pace, and we will continue with that. And nothing has changed in our philosophy. We will continue to show leverage year-after-year. Yes. Energy is not a very big vertical for it. Yes, we have some good customers, but they are not huge consumers of Snowflake. Really financial services is the number one vertical. It's about \u2013 if you look at it from a revenue perspective, about 20%, 21% of our revenue is from the financial services vertical, and then closely behind that is the media and entertainment, and technology is right after that as well, about the same. Those are our three biggest. And then health care is pretty big, but it can grow a lot bigger. Retail CPG is a meaningful segment as well. But financial services is very large, and those are very large stable edges, the data sharing that goes on in financial services. And when we talk about big accounts we landed in Europe, a big telco. We landed a big bank. We landed a big insurance company and we continue to land big accounts in these verticals. I would say, most SaaS companies when they land an account. They typically license most of the users in an account. When we land, we land small, and they go workload-by-workload and they just keep moving stuff over to Snowflake that drives that. And it's a multiyear journey within our customers. And I don't see any of our customers that are fully saturated. Well, I think some SaaS companies may be saturated. Yes. And just a quick follow-up, Snowflake has become de facto a cloud application development and the run time platform. People are building and deploying applications on Snowflake. I mean we have customers like Western Union who were starting whole businesses on top of Snowflake. Those are the conversations that we are having with customers. Workload modernization, we will be doing that until the end of time, but that's no longer the reality that dominates our daily existence. Well, we have a lot of that. You can see in the number of CAP 1s that we landed last quarter. It was north of 600. All of those customers, they signed up on Snowflake to move workloads to us. And we know, based upon discussions we have with many of our top customers, their plans, what we are planning on doing. As an example, we have a number of our customers that are just chomping at the bit for Snowpark to go into GA with Python because they want to do more on Snowflake. So, that's what gives us the confidence. And we spend a lot of time looking and engaging with our reps. We are talking to our customers to get a feel for what is consumption going to be like over the next three months, six months with our customers. Yes. As we said at our Summit conference, we expect those to be GA at the end of this year. So, a meaningful contribution to consumption will happen next year. No changes to our assumptions there. And we always expect that the biggest impact is in the second half of the year on those? And then Christian?"

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2022 that we will file with the SEC. We caution you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations. We'd also like to point out that on today's call, we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. To see the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings press release distributed earlier today and our investor presentation, which are posted at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks, Jimmy, and good afternoon, everybody. Product revenue grew 84% year-on-year to $394 million. Remaining performance obligations grew 82% year-on-year to $2.6 billion. And in the quarter, we added 16 Global 2000 customers. We closed the quarter with a record $181 million of non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, pairing high growth with improving unit economics and operational efficiency. Historically, enterprises have struggled to report yesterday's news in a timely manner. Data have to be transformed and transported to systems that produce the reports and dashboards that made sense out of transactional and operational data. There wasn't enough time or money in the day to ingest ever-larger volumes of data and perform long-running processes to make the data consumable and analytics ready. The public cloud infrastructure, coupled with cloud-native data platforms like Snowflake, broke the back of these laboring systems with tremendous scale, performance and economics. While these have been incredible advances, they are only scratching the surface of what is possible. Goals are evolving due to full-scale mobilization of data in the service of the enterprise mission. Data can do a lot more than authority reports what happened historically. We sometimes refer to our innovation of traditional data warehousing workloads as the end of the beginning, because so much more is possible. Data science can discover and describe data relationships and, therefore, also predict them and optimize courses of action. To enable machine learning and data science workloads, Snowflake has been investing for years now in the tooling for these workload types. This includes a wide variety of data programmability options as well as the Snowpark language run time capabilities in support of Java, Scala and Python. More generally, the Snowflake strategic focus is to enable every single workload type that needs to access govern data. The core idea behind the Snowflake Data Cloud is to enable work to come to the data and stop bringing data to the work. Prior to the data cloud, data was copied, transferred and replicated to be used wherever it was needed. That has led to rivers of data moving 24/7 causing operational complexity, cost and governance risks. The Snowflake Data Cloud holds the promise to bring that undesirable legacy to an end. Data stays put on the data cloud, and our workload enablement ensures that customers can have their needs met in terms of data engineering, data warehousing, data lake, data science, data analytics and data application development. We recently announced several product development milestones. Our acquisition of Streamlit closed. With Streamlit, we are enabling developers to build apps using their favorite tools and with simplified data access and governance. We're making great progress on our integration plans. Support for unstructured data is now generally available. Examples include securely sharing PDF documents in Snowflake Data Marketplace and storing medical images to extract data from them. We also entered a public preview for programming of unstructured data from the win Snowpark. Snowflake Data Marketplace monetization is now in public preview. This allows companies to easily publish a variety of data sets that then become available for purchase by other Snowflake users. Our summit conference in June will feature our most significant product announcements in four years. We look forward to discussing more innovations with you then. Use cases are often industry-specific applications of Snowflake. In the quarter, we announced the introduction of our healthcare and life sciences data cloud and the retail data cloud. The healthcare and life sciences data cloud helps customers deliver improved patient outcomes and accelerate clinical research and time to market. One of our pharmaceutical customers estimates that using Snowflake will improve their time to market for a new drug by three years. In the retail data cloud empowers retailers, manufacturers and consumer packaged goods vendors to access new data and seamlessly collaborate across the retail industry. Customers such as 84.51 and Albertsons are leveraging Snowflake to optimize operations for businesses across the sector. We also enable new use cases through partner enablement. We recently announced new partnerships with Dell Technologies and Pure Storage. With Dell, joint customers will be able to use on-premise data stored on Del object storage with the Snowflake data cloud while keeping their data local or seamlessly copying it to public clouds. With Pure Storage, joint customers will be able to work with data stored locally on Pure Storage FlashBlade. As we enable more workload types and use cases, the opportunity for data sharing grows. In Q1, the number of stable edges grew 122% year-on-year. 20% of our growing customer base has at least one stable edge, up from 15% a year ago. Snowflake's Data Marketplace listings grew 22% quarter-over-quarter, now with more than 1,350 data listings from over 260 providers. Our Snowflake Data Marketplace fuels our rich application development ecosystem and Powered by Snowflake program. Today, there are over 425 Powered by Snowflake partners, representing 48% quarter-over-quarter growth. Over the past three years, we have achieved high growth, while greatly improving unit economics, operating efficiency and cash flow. The company has a fortified balance sheet with $5 billion plus in cash, cash equivalents and investments and zero debt. We have the ability to continue to grow at scale, generate cash and invest accordingly. We will continue to do so. Snowflake is not a 'growth at all cost company, and we only invest with defined expectations in terms of returns and business impact. Research and development investments must lead to innovation and differentiation. Sales and marketing investments must lead to productive growth and G&A investment is focused on system and process efficiency. Our strategic focus on continued growth informs all of our investments, coupled with improving free cash flow generation. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. Q1 product revenues were $394 million, representing 84% year-over-year growth, and remaining performance obligations grew 82% year-over-year, totaling $2.6 billion. Of the $2.6 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 53% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, representing 79% year-over-year growth. Our net revenue retention of 174% includes 11 new $1 million customers and reflects durable growth among our largest customers. In Q1, 10 customers crossed the $5 million-plus threshold on a trailing 12-month basis. We now have $45 million customers and 10, $10 million customers. Similar to last quarter, five of our top 10 customer\u2019s product revenue grew faster year-over-year than the overall company. We continue to pursue a vertical strategy to drive growth in the enterprise. Product revenue from customers in the health care and life sciences vertical grew more than 100% year-over-year, and product revenue from customers in the financial services vertical grew just under 100% year-over-year. Driving this growth is our continued move upmarket. As we expand internationally, we are focused on the Forbes Global 2000 and other large institutions. In the quarter, we added 16 new Global 2000 customers, up from 12% in the same quarter last year. This enterprise focus also leads to larger deals. We booked four, eight figure deals in the quarter up from two in the same quarter last year. I would like to spend some time discussing the dynamics of our revenue and bookings in the quarter. Q1 product revenue represents significant growth at scale. We're excited about our customers' adoption and expansion of the platform. Our business model allows organizations to have complete flexibility on how much Snowflake they use. Customers rely on Snowflake to run their businesses. Their consumption aligns with their current business needs. Last year, we saw certain customers experience much higher than expected consumption -- own businesses were growing extremely fast. Today, some customers face a more challenging operating environment. Specific customers consume less than we anticipated amid shifting economic circumstances, we believe are unique to their businesses, most notably consumer facing cloud companies. Although these customers are still growing, we believe as long as they are impacted by macroeconomic headwinds their consumption will be impacted. Consumption patterns may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. This variability does not detract from our long-term opportunity. Customer\u2019s overall demand for Snowflake remains unchanged. This is supported by the contractual commitments they are making with us and their longer-term plans for adopting the data cloud across their organization. Turning to bookings. As I mentioned on last earnings call, we saw record bookings in Q4 fiscal year 2022. We outperformed our internal plan by approximately $300 million in the quarter. This led to a tough quarter-over-quarter comparison, which is why you're seeing a sequential decline in RPO in Q1. The outperformance in Q4 led us to increase our booking spend for fiscal 2023, and we still achieved our internal target in Q1. As a reminder, revenue is the leading indicator of our growth. Bookings and RPO follow consumption as our customers purchase more capacity. Now turning to margins on a non-GAAP basis. Our product gross margin was 75%. Scale in our public cloud data centers and enterprise customer success contribute to steady gross margin improvement. Our operating margin was 0%, benefiting from hiring linearity. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 43%, positively impacted by strong collections from record Q4 bookings. We ended the quarter in a strong cash position, with approximately $5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments. I would like to reiterate what Frank mentioned earlier. Snowflake is not a 'growth at all cost' company. And since we joined, it never has been. We evaluate investments based on yield. This has put us in a very strong position. We will continue to grow and are committed to showing leverage year-on-year. Now let's turn to our guidance. For the second quarter, we expect product revenues between $435 million and $440 million, representing year-over-year growth between 71% and 73%. Turning to margins. We expect on a non-GAAP basis, negative 2% operating margin, and we expect 358 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. As a reminder, we will be hosting our summit conference in-person in June. The associated expenses will largely be incurred in every Q2 moving forward. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect product revenues between $1.885 billion and $1.9 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 65% and 67%. Turning to profitability for the full year fiscal 2023, we expect on a non-GAAP basis, 74.5% product gross margin, 1% operating margin and 16% adjusted free cash flow margin, and we expect 358 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We are adding headcount to support our growth initiatives. Q1 was a record hiring quarter. For the full year, we still plan on adding more than 1,500 net new employees. Our long-term opportunity is stronger today than it has ever been. Our strategy of enabling more workloads and data types is playing out in front of us, and our market opportunity is expanding. And in our conversations with customers, it is clear that the Data Cloud plays a key role in the success of their business. With the growth we have seen over the last year and the expansion of our opportunity, we are confident that we will continue to execute at scale. In advance of our Investor Day, I would like to update our fiscal year 2029 targets. For fiscal year 2029, we are reiterating our target for product revenue of $10 billion, growing 30% year-over-year. We are increasing our margin targets and now expect on a non-GAAP basis approximately 78% product gross margin, 20% operating margin and 25% adjusted free cash flow margin. We look forward to sharing more information at our Investor Day on June 14 in Las Vegas in conjunction with Snowflake Summit. If you are interested in attending, please e-mail ir@snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Karl Keirstead of UBS. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks so much. Maybe I'll direct this one to you, Mike. Mike, given that you mentioned that some customers might be exposed to macro, you called out consumer-facing cloud companies, and maybe that pinched you a little bit in the April quarter. When you -- stepping back and reaffirming the full year product revenue guide of $1.9 billion, Mike, what are the assumptions you're embedding in that guidance for 2Q through 4Q? Are you assuming that what you saw in the April quarter essentially continues, gets a little bit worse? I think that might be an interesting color from you. Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, specifically, some of our large customers where we saw a decline, we've taken that on their forecast, but we have others that are offsetting partially some of that. What I will say is April, we did see weakness in week-over-week growth in our total revenue by customer. But to be honest, the last two weeks of March or May has been very strong. But just given everything in the macro headwinds we're hearing, we're going to be a little bit more cautious going into the full year.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. That makes sense to me prudent. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just to kind of piggyback on Karl's question, Mike, can you talk about specifically, what kind of consumption trends actually took a step back? And you mentioned even for some of the impacted companies, those numbers started to step back up in May. Again, kind of the confidence interval of how you see even within those companies, consumption patterns trending around the Data Cloud that give you conviction around the guidance.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I know all the customers that are going to be going into production that are the new ones because we've been working on these. That gives me the confidence. And I literally look at the revenue on a daily basis for all of our customers, and that's how we based our forecast. And as I said, the last two to three weeks has been very strong and week-over-week growth in revenue that gives us the conviction even with lowering on an individual basis, some of our larger customers that are still growing, just not at the pace we saw them grow last year.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. And is there any -- in terms of just maybe quantifying or sizing that impact, is that possible?\nMike Scarpelli: It is possible, but I told you what I'm going to tell you.\nAlex Zukin: Okay. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question. Two questions for you guys. One, last quarter, we talked a lot about a big price performance boost that you guys are pushing into your customers and the intended consequences both in terms of lowering revenues, but also incenting more workloads to come on to the platform. So question number one is, has that initiative had the intended consequences so far? Like, have you seen the behaviors that you're looking to see from that initiative? And then two, to piggyback on Karl's question. When customers -- when the consumption is below plan, does that typically come from people actually cutting existing workloads and doing less of what they were doing before, or is it more so the pace with, which new workloads get deployed is slowing down? Can you give us any context in terms of what impacts those consumption patterns more?\nMike Scarpelli: Yeah. So on the first question you asked, as we said last quarter, it's usually a lag between when we roll out performance improvements to when we see new workloads driving incremental revenue in Snowflake. But everything is going as planned with regards to the rollout of the -- specifically, you're asking for Graviton 2, the warehouse scheduling went out already last quarter, and we're seeing the benefit in customers, and the feedback from customers has been very strong, too, about that. On your other question, I'll let Christian answer that.\nChristian Kleinerman: Yeah, there are two drivers to -- when you see the lower consumption. One is just natural correlation with data and activity from the businesses. So if some business are expecting a slowdown in their activity, damage less data, which translates into pipelines and how much we're aggregating. The other aspect is you do see a little bit more of focus on optimization of the usage of Snowflake. So I would not characterize it as removal of workloads. It's just optimization of what they're doing and paying a little bit more attention to resources.\nMike Scarpelli: Yeah. And what I would say is a lot of these customers where we've seen the -- and we've taken our forecast down, these are customers that have grown so fast their business. And when you have that rapid growth in your business, you don't necessarily pay attention on cost as much. Many of these customers have publicly come out. You hear them on CNBC talking about cutting costs. And those are the ones who are being prudent and lowering some of our forecast consumption from them. And by the way, we're going into those customers to help them optimize as well, too.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much. So you had commented on slower consumption from consumer cloud. We're probably associating that with Facebook, Netflix, Peloton, Snap types of public companies that have missed. Is it reasonable to assume some softness from enterprise software companies, maybe the cash burning, venture backed ones that are also slowing their investments and trying to get to cash flow breakeven? And then it's kind of the same question for retailers. Just in the wake of Amazon, Walmart, Target, we have the three biggest retailers that have missed their own numbers. And I'm just wondering if there's any recalibration there?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I'm not going to name the customers, but none of them were the ones you mentioned. And there definitely is a focus on top of mind for many CFOs to find out where they can cut costs. And that's the beauty of a consumption model is you only expense what you use, and that's what our customers like as well, too. And so I feel good about the forecast that we just laid out, taking into consideration the macro environment and literally looking at our customer\u2019s continued usage of Snowflake, and I don't see that changing and in aggregate. Yes, I'm sure there's going to be some customers that are going to underperform. But likewise, there's going to be many customers that overperform. And long-term, none of these customers are moving off of Snowflake and most have plans to do more with Snowflake.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Mizuho. Please proceed.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. Thank you. Good afternoon guys. The net new customer count appears to be slowing down somewhat. It was lower on a year-over-year basis. I know it's more about quality over quantity. And Mike, you talked about 11 new seven-figure customers. But can you give us a little more color just on your -- and then just generally what your expectations are for net new when you look at your pipeline?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I don't disclose the target for what we're looking to add. But as you said, we -- and I said in my commentary, we're really focused on the largest enterprises in the world. It's not all customers are equal. We want to land those customers that can be the $1 million plus customers. So it's not all about -- it's the aggregate number. It's the quality of those individual customers, and that's what we're focused on.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Thank you so much, Frank and Mike. Did the full effect of the warehouse optimizer credit and the AMB upfront shift, did you get the full headwind effect in this quarter? Just curious about that\u2026\nMike Scarpelli: No.\nKash Rangan: \u2026or is there any more left to play out? Okay, okay. Got it.\nMike Scarpelli: No, the Graviton2 was rolled out over a period of time. The warehouse scheduling service was already done and that we have a full impact of that.\nKash Rangan: Got it. So, which quarter should we expect a maximum headwind and then the weighting of that headwind?\nMike Scarpelli: It's by the end of the year.\nKash Rangan: Okay, got it. Also, the -- you said that -- Mike, you said that you saw activity resumed back in the first couple of weeks of May. Was that the same cohort of customers that did go through the decline in consumption, or was it a -- was it more of an aggregate effect?\nMike Scarpelli: More of an aggregate effect.\nKash Rangan: Got it. And finally, are you rethinking how you structure contracts to have more subscription and more predictable element given that the macroeconomic environment is?\nMike Scarpelli: No.\nKash Rangan: And why would that not be the case?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, the problem is when you are in a consumption model, the more you use it, the more our costs are. And the only way to extract the value to cover the cost is by doing a consumption model.\nFrank Slootman: People have contracts.\nMike Scarpelli: And it's also much more customer friendly.\nKash Rangan: Got it, got it. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. Please proceed.\nKirk Materne: Hi. Thanks very much. Frank, you obviously, you've both been through some economic cycles before. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about just, sort of, the importance of Snowflake and data as we go through a potential economic cycle and the discretionary nature of it or the lack of being discretionary. I think people are thinking the consumer model also means it's discretionary. And I\u2019d imagine you have a very different take on that in terms of how customers are using your technology. So I was just wondering if you could give us some perspective on the longer term importance of what you guys are doing for your customers and why that gives you confidence in the fiscal 2029 guide? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. It's a fair question, and I saw some noise on this topic online as well. But it requires a little bit of more of a nuanced way of looking at it, meaning that it's not all one thing or all the same thing. I mean, the reality is that, our type of workloads become very heavily grafted into core business processes. And that, by the way, is also one of the reasons why it's -- we've talked about this for the last two years in the calls, how difficult it is to move workloads to Snowflake, because these workloads are so heavily grafted into operational processes. So these things are not going anywhere. They're not optional. They're not like, what do I feel like doing today? That, by the way, there are workloads like that, that's far more on the data lake side, where essentially you have a massive repository of files. And you may have data scientists that are just sort of fishing falls out of the lake and trying to decide to do some interesting stuff for that. That sort of thing is highly discretionary, but that's not the focus of our business. When people put data in Snowflake, I mean, they have some serious intentions on what they're going to do with that data. So that's not our part of the elephant that we're dealing with, but there are uses of data platforms that are of that sort that are much more discretionary where you can really avoid running processes. But in our world, as I said, it is so embedded into core business processes. It's not something that you can just sort of shut off for a while until things get better.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. And quick question. If you think about the -- as a couple of other guys said on the call, Mike and Frank, you've seen this play out before. If you think about your readiness or your kind of adoption to the situation, can you talk a little bit about what levers you have to think, for example, kind of have investments more in other industries that seem more stable and hence, prioritize spending in different sales segments, these different vertical segments, et cetera. Is there anything you can do there in terms of -- to do that? And if you -- I'm sure you've done the analysis, like, how much of exposure do you have to certain more consumer-facing? Is there anything you can share or maybe do it at the Analyst Day? Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. What I would say, Raimo, I'm not quite sure on your question, but on -- with regards to costs in our business, we're still seeing quite amazing growth at scale. And we're going to continue to invest in our business. But as I mentioned, we've done this all the time where we make efficient investments. There is no waste in Snowflake. There never has been in the last two-and-a-half years, and it won't be going forward. But there's a great opportunity in front of us. We're continuing to invest very heavily in R&D, and we're investing very heavily in the go-to-market function. And we will continue to do that, but we're going to do it efficiently and continue to show leverage in our model. And we're very focused on free cash flow. We're also in the envious position that we're sitting on over $5 billion today, and we will be opportunistic, because we're doing this for the long term, not for the next two quarters or three quarters or however long this macro uncertainty is going to last, but we're going to set ourselves up for the next 10, 20 years.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. And Mike, I came more from the revenue side, in terms of, like more of the still is focus like for example, as you're building out vertical clouds now, can you focus more on financials because that might be like safer or over the next\u2026\nMike Scarpelli : Well, we are. We're focused on all those clouds. And where we see the opportunities, we're going to add more resources. And we're seeing very strong in the health care. The retail, it may be -- you talk about all these retail clients missing, but they want better data. And they want to -- in troubled times, that's when people want to access data more to understand what's going on in their business, which is going to drive more Snowflake consumption. But definitely, financial services is one that always has been one of our biggest and will continue to be our biggest.\nRaimo Lenschow: Good. Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much guys. So instead of trying to dream up the 16th way of asking you about the macro and the impact it's having, I want to maybe put that aside for a sec, and I mean you're delivering amazing growth at scale, and certainly, that shouldn't be lost. But if we just think about pricing and maybe competitive dynamics, I think you guys have had strong discipline when it comes to pricing, very ROI-focused. But is there any reason to believe pricing is an obstacle for adoption? And maybe any evidence that you have to believe your competitors are seeing the same things you're seeing? And perhaps -- I don't know if it's changes the win rates or customers even stratifying their consumption across other alternatives to save money, anything that you can help us to appreciate what's going on along those dimensions would be helpful. Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. This is Frank, Brad. Our business is not commoditized, which is sort of another way of characterizing your question. There's certainly people in our world that are trying to commoditize the business. But customers are trying to do very difficult things, also very amazing things. So what they're paying for credit is already incredibly optimized. It's incredibly competitive. This is physics and economics, right? And there aren't many places to hide in terms of what we charge for. So it's not very, very productive for people to pursue things on that basis. One that's still developing the impact, the insights is really where it's at right now. So we've really not felt that pressure at all. And yes, you're right, we maintain good pricing discipline. We want to make sure that customers don't feel that they are subsidizing somebody else's business that we have good discipline, and we will continue to do that. But we sell best-of-breed, we sell value, we sell impact. We have verticalized our business because we're really adopting and owning the customers' mission, the customers' outcome rather than just sort of whining about whether we're going to pay a fraction of a cent more for compute credit, right? I mean those are really non-sensical conversations out with customers when they -- when a hospital is trying to save lives or improve quality of life. Those are the core missions of the institutions that want to use Snowflake for really amazing things. And that's the conversations that I'm certainly having with customers. And people are not coming at us with a hammer like that's to be cheaper. That's just not the dynamic that's playing out there.\nMike Scarpelli : I'm not aware of a single customer, a significant customer opportunity we're going after where we lost it over pricing -- not a single one.\nChristian Kleinerman: I'll add one more thing that we also look at the ratio of price performance and the performance and enhancements platform that we deliver, improve not only the factor, decisions and insights for customers, but also the economics of the platform. And from that front, customers see the value.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. I mean, we can use many examples. We have a lot of pharma customers. And their mission in life is to accelerate time to market of life-saving pharmaceuticals. That's what they're trying to do. Snowflake helps with that. That's what's on their mind. That's what preoccupying them, how do we do this, right? So, this whole commoditization thing, I think is a dog that just won't hunt very well.\nBrad Zelnick: Really appreciate the color. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kamil Mielczarek of William Blair. Please proceed.\nKamil Mielczarek: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Your sales and marketing headcount grew 55% year-over-year, the fastest rate in over two years, and net new adds almost doubled. Given the macro-related noise from some customers, why is now the right time to accelerate that growth? And when factoring in the time needed for new reps to ramp and the time needed to load data from new customers onto the platform, when should we expect this accelerated headcount growth to show up in the financial model?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, it's reflected in our long-term target of getting to $10 billion by fiscal year 2029. And Q1 is always our biggest hiring quarter in sales and marketing, as we've said before, because we onboard people at the beginning of a new comp year, but also for our sales kickoff. And it tends to be very heavy more in the SDRs that we try to onboard in big groups at once. And typically, depending on the nature of the rep, whether you're on the corporate team or you're on the enterprise or majors, it's anywhere from a six-month ramp to nine months to a year. And the people we're hiring now will have more of an impact on revenue next year has somewhat of an impact on bookings towards the end of the year, but this is what we were planning on doing all along. And as I said, we're going to continue to invest in our go-to-market function because of the opportunity we have in front of us. And we've shown that we can do it efficiently and continue to show leverage.\nKamil Mielczarek: That's helpful. Thank you. And if I could just quickly follow-up. Frank, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned all the great progress you've made to enable application developers. You acquired Streamlit. You're adding Python. You launched Powered by Snowflake. Have you seen any changes in the pace of app development in recent quarters? And are there key milestones that we should watch out for maybe around the rollout of specific features and integration that could make app development a more dependable flywheel for Snowflake? Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: Well, I specifically mentioned in the prepared remarks about the number of Powered by Snowflake partners that we now have in the growth was like 48% quarter-on-quarter. There is an enormous amount of energy in the -- on the application software development side. We're going to have a separate conference called Build later this year in November. This is a conference just for application developers. So, that whole end of the spectrum where our programmers lift is an enormous focus for Snowflake because our entire strategy is to enable workloads. And any time customers cannot do things on Snowflake that they want to do is a good day because then they will copy data out of Snowflake and then do it somewhere else and then we fall out of alignment with our business model, and things don't work the way are supposed to. So our whole game is we bring, we allow the work to come to the data. And whether you're a data engineer or whether you're a programmer, where you're going to see everything we do is this maximum investment to allow these workloads to execute extremely well, just from a usability standpoint, from an economic standpoint, obviously, from a performance standpoint, that's what this is all about. The more we succeed broadly along all these lines, the more it drives the core business model of consuming Snowflake, okay? So that's what \u2013 everything that we're doing, everything that we're announcing, everything you've seen from us is in full alignment with that focus and that strategy.\nMike Scarpelli: Yeah. And that will add, too, we're extremely excited about Streamlit. And what's amazing about that is that the Streamlit acquisition we announced last quarter, we've already seen a 25% increase in the number of developers using Streamlit today. And we think once that's reintegrated into Snowflake that will be meaningful for the app development in Snowflake.\nKamil Mielczarek: That's great. Take care. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Frank, I had a question for you regarding your prepared remarks. You talked about the unstructured data opportunity. It's in preview now. Any more color you can give on timing when will this be GA? And how big is the universe of customers trying this out? How do you think the impact it can have on your performance out of the gate?\nFrank Slootman: I'm going to just flip this one over to Christian, if you don't mind.\nChristian Kleinerman: Yeah. The core capability is generally available. What you'll see us announcing both at our summit user conference in a couple of weeks and throughout the years, additional capabilities on how to extract additional value from unstructured types. But all of the benefits of Snowflake around data governance and replication and data sharing, that's available for \u2013 actually in use already.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. I guess, Mike, on the consumption side, I look back at the pandemic. That was the most recent business cycle where we saw a pretty meaningful slowdown. Your business actually did slow sequentially for about two quarters and then reaccelerated. I guess if you just were to go back in time and look at some of the customers most impacted, travel, hospitality as their businesses were impacted, did they recover two quarters later as well, because they start to use new use cases beyond just a slowdown in their business? Just trying to think back what you saw in the past relative to a slowdown in the pandemic and then that reacceleration. Just wondering what you saw then and kind of comparing maybe a little bit to what you're seeing now. Thanks.\nMike Scarpelli: I really don't have that data on those specific industries, looking at it. I really haven't. And what I will say is the slowdown we saw came from some of our highest growth customers that is unique to their businesses is what we saw in April, in particular. With that \u2013 which caused us to reset those -- and these are some of our largest customers, $10 million, that we've reset their forecast for the full year, that is what you're seeing in there. We still \u2013 as I looked at it today, we have a number of our top 10 customers that are outperforming our forecast, and we have a few that are below that internal, but that is what we typically see every quarter.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. The only thing I would add -- it's Frank here. I do recall from the pandemic that it started to trigger a lot of new use cases in response to people were in a fog, they just couldn't understand where demand was, where demand wasn't. Supply chains were upside down. Sending products in the wrong places, so there was a renewed focus to really try to understand what was happening to them. And that led to some form of demand acceleration that started to compensate for the sort of sectoral weaknesses that were, as you said, in travel and hospitality and things of that sort. So that's sort of what went on there. And that's going to happen again now as well because when you have dislocations of this sort, people are going to resort to a much stronger analytical focus.\nBrent Bracelin: Great. And just a quick follow-up on the workflow -- new workload area. I spoke to a Snowflake customer in the consumer retail space last week that talked about building a data app store on top of Snowflake. Obviously, it sounds like that might be tied to Streamlit. But what -- how popular is this idea of building an app store on top of Snowflake as you think about that as a new workload lever for the business?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. So the general capability we have around data sharing and function sharing, which is the foundation of our marketplace has been also leveraged by a number of third parties to be the enabling technology for data distribution and data commercialization. So I don't know about the specifics, but I think that's what -- that may be you're referring to.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Derrick Wood of Cowen. Please proceed.\nDerrick Wood: Hey, guys. First question. I think you made some tweaks to go-to-market teams in Q1 as you evolve more towards a verticalized strategy. Can you remind us what changes you may have made and whether there was any kind of impact to productivity in Q1, or how did you feel about that sales productivity for new bookings in the quarter?\nMike Scarpelli: Hi, Derrick, as I mentioned, we hit our internal Q1 bookings plan for growth. Productivity is where we needed to be. And the change we made is we went to an industry vertical focus from a geography focus with the majors, and there were a number of accounts that moved under new sales leadership. But by and large, the reps themselves did not change. And that's something we have been talking about for almost a year. We were going to roll it out starting this commission plan year.\nDerrick Wood: Great. And Mike, you raised the long-term free cash flow margin target from 15% to 25%. That's a pretty large jump. What -- can you walk us through kind of the biggest changes in your assumptions?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I'd say, I think we were probably overly conservative last year. We just -- as a reminder, we just did 43% free cash flow this recent quarter, which is skewed, but I feel very good about 16%-plus for the full year this year. And as I mentioned, we're going to continue to show leverage every year, and I'm not -- collecting cash from our customers is not an issue.\nDerrick Wood: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Tyler Radke of Citi. Please proceed.\nTyler Radke: Thanks for taking the question. Could you just talk about what you saw in EMEA and internationally, if there was any slowdowns with some of the macro noise out there in the quarter? And then I just wanted to clarify in terms of your outlook, did you make assumptions in terms of lower consumption rates going forward beyond just those large customers you referenced, or was it only specific to those customers? Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: We lowered it for specific customers, and we still continue to see, as I've mentioned in the last two and a half weeks, we've seen quite high growth on a daily basis for revenue week-over-week. So customers are increasing their consumption and in line with what we're forecasting. Yes, I do see some weakness in Europe, but I'm not going to necessarily blame it on the macro. I think it's probably an execution on our part as well, too. Frank has been spending a lot of time in Europe recently, and we'll continue as well as Chris Degnan over there. APJ is very strong for us. We're seeing really good growth there. Mind you, it's small. I would say North America enterprise was very strong last quarter, as well as our commercial business was strong in North America.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Please proceed.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Mike, earlier in the call, you had talked about having good line of sight on new customers coming on to the platform. I know it usually takes well over a year for a new customer to hit their stride. How should we think about the go-forward growth rates of net new customers versus historically over the last few years? And what have you sort of modeled in? Thanks.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, the biggest impact is going to be existing customers in the current year driving revenue. When we start a year, roughly 94% of our revenue comes from existing customers. The customers we're landing now have a bigger impact going out. And when I say the visibility, when we are signing up new customers, we know it takes them six to nine months to really ramp on our platform, because it takes time to do the migration. And that's what I'm saying, those customers that we signed up in Q3 and Q4 are starting to come on in Q2.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nPhil Winslow: Hi. Thanks guys for taking my question. Last quarter, there was a lot of focus on the impact of the Graviton chips on consumption. But I wanted to double click on the workload schedule, it\u2019s something that we've been talking to customers about being an area of enhancement they've been looking for. What are you seeing in terms of just to go up the negative impact that you discussed right now? Is it similar to what you expect, any different? But also what are customers saying, call it, on the flip side of this, what types of new workloads could be brought on the Snowflake? What does this open up that maybe wasn't necessarily going to move to Snowflake without enhanced workload scheduling? Thanks.\nMike Scarpelli: I'll just say, the impact of warehouse scheduling service has been what we planned. As I mentioned, we had rolled it out already before the end of -- that got rolled out in January, and that had an impact on the quarter, and the impact was what we were expecting. In terms of what new workloads, I'll let Christian talk about that.\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. We've heard from many of our customers that they see the concurrency improvement, the lower latency, and many of them have expressed intent of bringing additional workloads on to Snowflake. Oftentimes, those processes take time. So we cannot say that the migrations have happened, but the intention to leverage these new capabilities is something we hear frequently about.\nMike Scarpelli: There's been nothing but positive impact from our customers on these performance improvements.\nPhil Winslow: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Gray Powell of BTIG. Please proceed.\nGray Powell: Okay. Thanks for taking the question. So, yes, I mean, I know we've kind of hit on this before, but I do think that everybody understands that there's risk just across all of software, if we go into a recession. But Snowflake is generating a lot of free cash flow. You're sitting on $5 billion in cash. So let's just say the economy gets worse and everyone starts seeing slowing growth. Where would you look to invest in order to come out a bigger and stronger company once the world stabilizes, or said differently, where do you see opportunities in this downturn?\nFrank Slootman: This is Frank. I think Mike has already tried to answer this question a few times this afternoon, but we see opportunity absolutely everywhere at this point. We have a very -- on a daily basis, we can see which customers, which verticals, which use cases, which workloads are trending and which ones are not. So we have the ability to adjust direct investments where they're most likely to have the yield and the impact that we're looking for. But we're not in a -- there's no reason for us to be in a battening down the hatches mode, because the investments that we're making are continuing to yield. I mean, we've been saying that, if we start backing off from our growth trajectory, considering how well it's working for us. Our opportunity is incredibly broad-based. I mean there's still verticals where we're not very well penetrated as well. For example, the public sector, especially federal government. I shouldn't say -- there are parts of the federal -- the public sector where we're doing quite well, where we are making investments, because over the long haul, we really plan to have a very, very large business in those sectors. But that's not something you sort of turn on and off on a dime. Once you're on an investment process there, you got to \u2013 you have to stick with it.  At some point, things will change again, right? We can't be crash tacking the ship every time people get a little nervous around the table, right? So as long as we can drive growth as we are with the economics that we are producing in terms of the unit economics, in terms of operating efficient, in terms of cash flow, why would we not be doing it? So, we're not cowering in the corner. We're going to go out there and do what we do.  Now circumstances change to the point where we feel that these investments are not yielding, of course, we're going to make changes, right? But that time is not now. I mean, the behavior of our customers and how they're \u2013 the type of contracts they're stepping up to, they are not in a mode yet where they're sort of in a massive avoidance mode of doing contracts or trying to do a natural acts in terms of the expenses that you're generating as part of the platform. So, I think we're getting a little bit ahead of ourselves in terms of what the real economy really is at this moment in time.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. I'll add to that. I do think the next 6 months if things stay where they are, there could be interesting opportunities on the M&A front, not necessarily big M&A, but I do think the -- there's going to be some valuation resets on some of the private companies out there, that could create interesting opportunities. And that's where I'm saying there may be some opportunities, which areas that are on our roadmap where it may make sense to buy a team with some good technology, not necessarily, we're not looking for revenue, but good teams and technology at a more reasonable valuation.\nGray Powell: That makes lot of sense. Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from DJ Hynes of Canaccord. Please proceed.\nDJ Hynes: Hey, thanks guys. Mike, just one for you. So, if you see more consumption rollover, which I think notionally kind of lowers your expansion opportunities at renewal, how does that impact your thinking around retention of sales staff? I know just given the comp model, driving expansions like foundational to how these guys get paid. Is that something you worry about at all or how would you manage through it?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. So just to be clear, we still are seeing our customers consume their contracted amount well within their contract period. Actually, one of our largest customers who signed a three-year $100 million deal, we've already invoiced them for their third year when we're still in the second year. And I don't see that changing for our customers because most of our customers have historically, and I still see that happening, consuming within their contract period. I just don't see that changing right now. The only thing that has changed and they're still growing, the growth rate that we've seen historically with some of these fast growth companies has slowed down. And I'm not going to give you the names on the conference call with those customers.\nDJ Hynes: Sure. Okay. Yes, that's an important clarification. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from Steve Koenig of SMBC. Please proceed.\nSteve Koenig: Thanks gentlemen for squeezing me in. I'll just ask one question for Mike. And by the way, it's a pleasure to be covering you guys now. So Mike, the acceleration in NRR and revenue per customer across fiscal 2022 was really remarkable. Can you talk a little bit about what drove this? And just qualitatively, how should we think about the puts and takes on the trends in those metrics going forward, either short-term lumpiness or longer term? Thanks very much.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, NRR is really driven by, a, our largest customers continuing to grow quite quickly, but also new customers that are coming into the cohort that are ramping. And this shouldn't surprise -- this is the real focus that we've had over the last two years seasonally and this is why this isn't about number of customers, quality customers. We have a lot of these large customers we've landed that are now in a two-year cohort that are ramping their usage of Snowflake. As I said in the past, I don't expect the net revenue retention to stay at this extremely high rate. I do think it will come down over time. It will come down gradually over time, but I don't see it increasing, and I mentioned that last quarter. And I do think that will continue to come down, but it will remain well above 130% for a very long time.\nSteve Koenig: Got it. Great. Well, thank you very much.\nOperator: That will conclude the time of questions. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christian Kleinerman",
            "content": "Yeah, there are two drivers to -- when you see the lower consumption. One is just natural correlation with data and activity from the businesses. So if some business are expecting a slowdown in their activity, damage less data, which translates into pipelines and how much we're aggregating. The other aspect is you do see a little bit more of focus on optimization of the usage of Snowflake. So I would not characterize it as removal of workloads. It's just optimization of what they're doing and paying a little bit more attention to resources. I'll add one more thing that we also look at the ratio of price performance and the performance and enhancements platform that we deliver, improve not only the factor, decisions and insights for customers, but also the economics of the platform. And from that front, customers see the value. Yeah. The core capability is generally available. What you'll see us announcing both at our summit user conference in a couple of weeks and throughout the years, additional capabilities on how to extract additional value from unstructured types. But all of the benefits of Snowflake around data governance and replication and data sharing, that's available for \u2013 actually in use already. Yes.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks, Jimmy, and good afternoon, everybody. Product revenue grew 84% year-on-year to $394 million. Remaining performance obligations grew 82% year-on-year to $2.6 billion. And in the quarter, we added 16 Global 2000 customers. We closed the quarter with a record $181 million of non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, pairing high growth with improving unit economics and operational efficiency. Historically, enterprises have struggled to report yesterday's news in a timely manner. Data have to be transformed and transported to systems that produce the reports and dashboards that made sense out of transactional and operational data. There wasn't enough time or money in the day to ingest ever-larger volumes of data and perform long-running processes to make the data consumable and analytics ready. The public cloud infrastructure, coupled with cloud-native data platforms like Snowflake, broke the back of these laboring systems with tremendous scale, performance and economics. While these have been incredible advances, they are only scratching the surface of what is possible. Goals are evolving due to full-scale mobilization of data in the service of the enterprise mission. Data can do a lot more than authority reports what happened historically. We sometimes refer to our innovation of traditional data warehousing workloads as the end of the beginning, because so much more is possible. Data science can discover and describe data relationships and, therefore, also predict them and optimize courses of action. To enable machine learning and data science workloads, Snowflake has been investing for years now in the tooling for these workload types. This includes a wide variety of data programmability options as well as the Snowpark language run time capabilities in support of Java, Scala and Python. More generally, the Snowflake strategic focus is to enable every single workload type that needs to access govern data. The core idea behind the Snowflake Data Cloud is to enable work to come to the data and stop bringing data to the work. Prior to the data cloud, data was copied, transferred and replicated to be used wherever it was needed. That has led to rivers of data moving 24/7 causing operational complexity, cost and governance risks. The Snowflake Data Cloud holds the promise to bring that undesirable legacy to an end. Data stays put on the data cloud, and our workload enablement ensures that customers can have their needs met in terms of data engineering, data warehousing, data lake, data science, data analytics and data application development. We recently announced several product development milestones. Our acquisition of Streamlit closed. With Streamlit, we are enabling developers to build apps using their favorite tools and with simplified data access and governance. We're making great progress on our integration plans. Support for unstructured data is now generally available. Examples include securely sharing PDF documents in Snowflake Data Marketplace and storing medical images to extract data from them. We also entered a public preview for programming of unstructured data from the win Snowpark. Snowflake Data Marketplace monetization is now in public preview. This allows companies to easily publish a variety of data sets that then become available for purchase by other Snowflake users. Our summit conference in June will feature our most significant product announcements in four years. We look forward to discussing more innovations with you then. Use cases are often industry-specific applications of Snowflake. In the quarter, we announced the introduction of our healthcare and life sciences data cloud and the retail data cloud. The healthcare and life sciences data cloud helps customers deliver improved patient outcomes and accelerate clinical research and time to market. One of our pharmaceutical customers estimates that using Snowflake will improve their time to market for a new drug by three years. In the retail data cloud empowers retailers, manufacturers and consumer packaged goods vendors to access new data and seamlessly collaborate across the retail industry. Customers such as 84.51 and Albertsons are leveraging Snowflake to optimize operations for businesses across the sector. We also enable new use cases through partner enablement. We recently announced new partnerships with Dell Technologies and Pure Storage. With Dell, joint customers will be able to use on-premise data stored on Del object storage with the Snowflake data cloud while keeping their data local or seamlessly copying it to public clouds. With Pure Storage, joint customers will be able to work with data stored locally on Pure Storage FlashBlade. As we enable more workload types and use cases, the opportunity for data sharing grows. In Q1, the number of stable edges grew 122% year-on-year. 20% of our growing customer base has at least one stable edge, up from 15% a year ago. Snowflake's Data Marketplace listings grew 22% quarter-over-quarter, now with more than 1,350 data listings from over 260 providers. Our Snowflake Data Marketplace fuels our rich application development ecosystem and Powered by Snowflake program. Today, there are over 425 Powered by Snowflake partners, representing 48% quarter-over-quarter growth. Over the past three years, we have achieved high growth, while greatly improving unit economics, operating efficiency and cash flow. The company has a fortified balance sheet with $5 billion plus in cash, cash equivalents and investments and zero debt. We have the ability to continue to grow at scale, generate cash and invest accordingly. We will continue to do so. Snowflake is not a 'growth at all cost company, and we only invest with defined expectations in terms of returns and business impact. Research and development investments must lead to innovation and differentiation. Sales and marketing investments must lead to productive growth and G&A investment is focused on system and process efficiency. Our strategic focus on continued growth informs all of our investments, coupled with improving free cash flow generation. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. People have contracts. Yes. It's a fair question, and I saw some noise on this topic online as well. But it requires a little bit of more of a nuanced way of looking at it, meaning that it's not all one thing or all the same thing. I mean, the reality is that, our type of workloads become very heavily grafted into core business processes. And that, by the way, is also one of the reasons why it's -- we've talked about this for the last two years in the calls, how difficult it is to move workloads to Snowflake, because these workloads are so heavily grafted into operational processes. So these things are not going anywhere. They're not optional. They're not like, what do I feel like doing today? That, by the way, there are workloads like that, that's far more on the data lake side, where essentially you have a massive repository of files. And you may have data scientists that are just sort of fishing falls out of the lake and trying to decide to do some interesting stuff for that. That sort of thing is highly discretionary, but that's not the focus of our business. When people put data in Snowflake, I mean, they have some serious intentions on what they're going to do with that data. So that's not our part of the elephant that we're dealing with, but there are uses of data platforms that are of that sort that are much more discretionary where you can really avoid running processes. But in our world, as I said, it is so embedded into core business processes. It's not something that you can just sort of shut off for a while until things get better. Yes. This is Frank, Brad. Our business is not commoditized, which is sort of another way of characterizing your question. There's certainly people in our world that are trying to commoditize the business. But customers are trying to do very difficult things, also very amazing things. So what they're paying for credit is already incredibly optimized. It's incredibly competitive. This is physics and economics, right? And there aren't many places to hide in terms of what we charge for. So it's not very, very productive for people to pursue things on that basis. One that's still developing the impact, the insights is really where it's at right now. So we've really not felt that pressure at all. And yes, you're right, we maintain good pricing discipline. We want to make sure that customers don't feel that they are subsidizing somebody else's business that we have good discipline, and we will continue to do that. But we sell best-of-breed, we sell value, we sell impact. We have verticalized our business because we're really adopting and owning the customers' mission, the customers' outcome rather than just sort of whining about whether we're going to pay a fraction of a cent more for compute credit, right? I mean those are really non-sensical conversations out with customers when they -- when a hospital is trying to save lives or improve quality of life. Those are the core missions of the institutions that want to use Snowflake for really amazing things. And that's the conversations that I'm certainly having with customers. And people are not coming at us with a hammer like that's to be cheaper. That's just not the dynamic that's playing out there. Yes. I mean, we can use many examples. We have a lot of pharma customers. And their mission in life is to accelerate time to market of life-saving pharmaceuticals. That's what they're trying to do. Snowflake helps with that. That's what's on their mind. That's what preoccupying them, how do we do this, right? So, this whole commoditization thing, I think is a dog that just won't hunt very well. Well, I specifically mentioned in the prepared remarks about the number of Powered by Snowflake partners that we now have in the growth was like 48% quarter-on-quarter. There is an enormous amount of energy in the -- on the application software development side. We're going to have a separate conference called Build later this year in November. This is a conference just for application developers. So, that whole end of the spectrum where our programmers lift is an enormous focus for Snowflake because our entire strategy is to enable workloads. And any time customers cannot do things on Snowflake that they want to do is a good day because then they will copy data out of Snowflake and then do it somewhere else and then we fall out of alignment with our business model, and things don't work the way are supposed to. So our whole game is we bring, we allow the work to come to the data. And whether you're a data engineer or whether you're a programmer, where you're going to see everything we do is this maximum investment to allow these workloads to execute extremely well, just from a usability standpoint, from an economic standpoint, obviously, from a performance standpoint, that's what this is all about. The more we succeed broadly along all these lines, the more it drives the core business model of consuming Snowflake, okay? So that's what \u2013 everything that we're doing, everything that we're announcing, everything you've seen from us is in full alignment with that focus and that strategy. I'm going to just flip this one over to Christian, if you don't mind. Yes. The only thing I would add -- it's Frank here. I do recall from the pandemic that it started to trigger a lot of new use cases in response to people were in a fog, they just couldn't understand where demand was, where demand wasn't. Supply chains were upside down. Sending products in the wrong places, so there was a renewed focus to really try to understand what was happening to them. And that led to some form of demand acceleration that started to compensate for the sort of sectoral weaknesses that were, as you said, in travel and hospitality and things of that sort. So that's sort of what went on there. And that's going to happen again now as well because when you have dislocations of this sort, people are going to resort to a much stronger analytical focus. This is Frank. I think Mike has already tried to answer this question a few times this afternoon, but we see opportunity absolutely everywhere at this point. We have a very -- on a daily basis, we can see which customers, which verticals, which use cases, which workloads are trending and which ones are not.

Of the $2.6 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 53% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, representing 79% year-over-year growth. Our net revenue retention of 174% includes 11 new $1 million customers and reflects durable growth among our largest customers. In Q1, 10 customers crossed the $5 million-plus threshold on a trailing 12-month basis. We now have $45 million customers and 10, $10 million customers. Similar to last quarter, five of our top 10 customer's product revenue grew faster year-over-year than the overall company. We continue to pursue a vertical strategy to drive growth in the enterprise. Product revenue from customers in the health care and life sciences vertical grew more than 100% year-over-year, and product revenue from customers in the financial services vertical grew just under 100% year-over-year. Driving this growth is our continued move upmarket. As we expand internationally, we are focused on the Forbes Global 2000 and other large institutions. In the quarter, we added 16 new Global 2000 customers, up from 12% in the same quarter last year. This enterprise focus also leads to larger deals. We booked four, eight figure deals in the quarter up from two in the same quarter last year. I would like to spend some time discussing the dynamics of our revenue and bookings in the quarter. Q1 product revenue represents significant growth at scale. We're excited about our customers' adoption and expansion of the platform. Our business model allows organizations to have complete flexibility on how much Snowflake they use. Customers rely on Snowflake to run their businesses. Their consumption aligns with their current business needs. Last year, we saw certain customers experience much higher than expected consumption -- own businesses were growing extremely fast. Today, some customers face a more challenging operating environment. Specific customers consume less than we anticipated amid shifting economic circumstances, we believe are unique to their businesses, most notably consumer facing cloud companies. Although these customers are still growing, we believe as long as they are impacted by macroeconomic headwinds their consumption will be impacted. Consumption patterns may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. This variability does not detract from our long-term opportunity. Customer's overall demand for Snowflake remains unchanged. This is supported by the contractual commitments they are making with us and their longer-term plans for adopting the data cloud across their organization. Turning to bookings. As I mentioned on last earnings call, we saw record bookings in Q4 fiscal year 2022. We outperformed our internal plan by approximately $300 million in the quarter. This led to a tough quarter-over-quarter comparison, which is why you're seeing a sequential decline in RPO in Q1. The outperformance in Q4 led us to increase our booking spend for fiscal 2023, and we still achieved our internal target in Q1. As a reminder, revenue is the leading indicator of our growth. Bookings and RPO follow consumption as our customers purchase more capacity. Now turning to margins on a non-GAAP basis. Our product gross margin was 75%. Scale in our public cloud data centers and enterprise customer success contribute to steady gross margin improvement. Our operating margin was 0%, benefiting from hiring linearity. Our adjusted free cash flow margin was 43%, positively impacted by strong collections from record Q4 bookings. We ended the quarter in a strong cash position, with approximately $5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term investments. I would like to reiterate what Frank mentioned earlier. Snowflake is not a 'growth at all cost' company. And since we joined, it never has been. We evaluate investments based on yield. This has put us in a very strong position. We will continue to grow and are committed to showing leverage year-on-year. Now let's turn to our guidance. For the second quarter, we expect product revenues between $435 million and $440 million, representing year-over-year growth between 71% and 73%. Turning to margins. We expect on a non-GAAP basis, negative 2% operating margin, and we expect 358 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. As a reminder, we will be hosting our summit conference in-person in June. The associated expenses will largely be incurred in every Q2 moving forward. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect product revenues between $1.885 billion and $1.9 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 65% and 67%. Turning to profitability for the full year fiscal 2023, we expect on a non-GAAP basis, 74.5% product gross margin, 1% operating margin and 16% adjusted free cash flow margin, and we expect 358 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We are adding headcount to support our growth initiatives. Q1 was a record hiring quarter. For the full year, we still plan on adding more than 1,500 net new employees. Our long-term opportunity is stronger today than it has ever been. Our strategy of enabling more workloads and data types is playing out in front of us, and our market opportunity is expanding. And in our conversations with customers, it is clear that the Data Cloud plays a key role in the success of their business. With the growth we have seen over the last year and the expansion of our opportunity, we are confident that we will continue to execute at scale. In advance of our Investor Day, I would like to update our fiscal year 2029 targets. For fiscal year 2029, we are reiterating our target for product revenue of $10 billion, growing 30% year-over-year. We are increasing our margin targets and now expect on a non-GAAP basis approximately 78% product gross margin, 20% operating margin and 25% adjusted free cash flow margin. We look forward to sharing more information at our Investor Day on June 14 in Las Vegas in conjunction with Snowflake Summit. If you are interested in attending, please e-mail ir@snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Well, specifically, some of our large customers where we saw a decline, we've taken that on their forecast, but we have others that are offsetting partially some of that. What I will say is April, we did see weakness in week-over-week growth in our total revenue by customer. But to be honest, the last two weeks of March or May has been very strong. But just given everything in the macro headwinds we're hearing, we're going to be a little bit more cautious going into the full year. Well, I know all the customers that are going to be going into production that are the new ones because we've been working on these. That gives me the confidence. And I literally look at the revenue on a daily basis for all of our customers, and that's how we based our forecast. And as I said, the last two to three weeks has been very strong and week-over-week growth in revenue that gives us the conviction even with lowering on an individual basis, some of our larger customers that are still growing, just not at the pace we saw them grow last year. It is possible, but I told you what I'm going to tell you. Yeah. So on the first question you asked, as we said last quarter, it's usually a lag between when we roll out performance improvements to when we see new workloads driving incremental revenue in Snowflake. But everything is going as planned with regards to the rollout of the -- specifically, you're asking for Graviton 2, the warehouse scheduling went out already last quarter, and we're seeing the benefit in customers, and the feedback from customers has been very strong, too, about that. On your other question, I'll let Christian answer that. Yeah. And what I would say is a lot of these customers where we've seen the -- and we've taken our forecast down, these are customers that have grown so fast their business. And when you have that rapid growth in your business, you don't necessarily pay attention on cost as much. Many of these customers have publicly come out. You hear them on CNBC talking about cutting costs. And those are the ones who are being prudent and lowering some of our forecast consumption from them. And by the way, we're going into those customers to help them optimize as well, too. Well, I'm not going to name the customers, but none of them were the ones you mentioned. And there definitely is a focus on top of mind for many CFOs to find out where they can cut costs. And that's the beauty of a consumption model is you only expense what you use, and that's what our customers like as well, too. And so I feel good about the forecast that we just laid out, taking into consideration the macro environment and literally looking at our customer's continued usage of Snowflake, and I don't see that changing and in aggregate. Yes, I'm sure there's going to be some customers that are going to underperform. But likewise, there's going to be many customers that overperform. And long-term, none of these customers are moving off of Snowflake and most have plans to do more with Snowflake. Well, I don't disclose the target for what we're looking to add. But as you said, we -- and I said in my commentary, we're really focused on the largest enterprises in the world. It's not all customers are equal. We want to land those customers that can be the $1 million plus customers. So it's not all about -- it's the aggregate number. It's the quality of those individual customers, and that's what we're focused on. No. No, the Graviton2 was rolled out over a period of time. The warehouse scheduling service was already done and that we have a full impact of that. It's by the end of the year. More of an aggregate effect. No. Well, the problem is when you are in a consumption model, the more you use it, the more our costs are. And the only way to extract the value to cover the cost is by doing a consumption model. And it's also much more customer friendly. Yes. What I would say, Raimo, I'm not quite sure on your question, but on -- with regards to costs in our business, we're still seeing quite amazing growth at scale. And we're going to continue to invest in our business. But as I mentioned, we've done this all the time where we make efficient investments. There is no waste in Snowflake. There never has been in the last two-and-a-half years, and it won't be going forward. But there's a great opportunity in front of us. We're continuing to invest very heavily in R&D, and we're investing very heavily in the go-to-market function. And we will continue to do that, but we're going to do it efficiently and continue to show leverage in our model. And we're very focused on free cash flow. We're also in the envious position that we're sitting on over $5 billion today, and we will be opportunistic, because we're doing this for the long term, not for the next two quarters or three quarters or however long this macro uncertainty is going to last, but we're going to set ourselves up for the next 10, 20 years. Well, we are. We're focused on all those clouds. And where we see the opportunities, we're going to add more resources. And we're seeing very strong in the health care. The retail, it may be -- you talk about all these retail clients missing, but they want better data. And they want to -- in troubled times, that's when people want to access data more to understand what's going on in their business, which is going to drive more Snowflake consumption. But definitely, financial services is one that always has been one of our biggest and will continue to be our biggest. I'm not aware of a single customer, a significant customer opportunity we're going after where we lost it over pricing -- not a single one. Well, it's reflected in our long-term target of getting to $10 billion by fiscal year 2029. And Q1 is always our biggest hiring quarter in sales and marketing, as we've said before, because we onboard people at the beginning of a new comp year, but also for our sales kickoff. And it tends to be very heavy more in the SDRs that we try to onboard in big groups at once. And typically, depending on the nature of the rep, whether you're on the corporate team or you're on the enterprise or majors, it's anywhere from a six-month ramp to nine months to a year. And the people we're hiring now will have more of an impact on revenue next year has somewhat of an impact on bookings towards the end of the year, but this is what we were planning on doing all along. And as I said, we're going to continue to invest in our go-to-market function because of the opportunity we have in front of us. And we've shown that we can do it efficiently and continue to show leverage. Yeah. And that will add, too, we're extremely excited about Streamlit. And what's amazing about that is that the Streamlit acquisition we announced last quarter, we've already seen a 25% increase in the number of developers using Streamlit today. And we think once that's reintegrated into Snowflake that will be meaningful for the app development in Snowflake. I really don't have that data on those specific industries, looking at it. I really haven't. And what I will say is the slowdown we saw came from some of our highest growth customers that is unique to their businesses is what we saw in April, in particular. With that \u2013 which caused us to reset those -- and these are some of our largest customers, $10 million, that we've reset their forecast for the full year, that is what you're seeing in there. We still \u2013 as I looked at it today, we have a number of our top 10 customers that are outperforming our forecast, and we have a few that are below that internal, but that is what we typically see every quarter. Hi, Derrick, as I mentioned, we hit our internal Q1 bookings plan for growth. Productivity is where we needed to be. And the change we made is we went to an industry vertical focus from a geography focus with the majors, and there were a number of accounts that moved under new sales leadership. But by and large, the reps themselves did not change. And that's something we have been talking about for almost a year. We were going to roll it out starting this commission plan year. Well, I'd say, I think we were probably overly conservative last year. We just -- as a reminder, we just did 43% free cash flow this recent quarter, which is skewed, but I feel very good about 16%-plus for the full year this year. And as I mentioned, we're going to continue to show leverage every year, and I'm not -- collecting cash from our customers is not an issue. We lowered it for specific customers, and we still continue to see, as I've mentioned in the last two and a half weeks, we've seen quite high growth on a daily basis for revenue week-over-week. So customers are increasing their consumption and in line with what we're forecasting. Yes, I do see some weakness in Europe, but I'm not going to necessarily blame it on the macro. I think it's probably an execution on our part as well, too. Frank has been spending a lot of time in Europe recently, and we'll continue as well as Chris Degnan over there. APJ is very strong for us. We're seeing really good growth there. Mind you, it's small. I would say North America enterprise was very strong last quarter, as well as our commercial business was strong in North America. Well, the biggest impact is going to be existing customers in the current year driving revenue. When we start a year, roughly 94% of our revenue comes from existing customers. The customers we're landing now have a bigger impact going out. And when I say the visibility, when we are signing up new customers, we know it takes them six to nine months to really ramp on our platform, because it takes time to do the migration. And that's what I'm saying, those customers that we signed up in Q3 and Q4 are starting to come on in Q2. I'll just say, the impact of warehouse scheduling service has been what we planned. As I mentioned, we had rolled it out already before the end of -- that got rolled out in January, and that had an impact on the quarter, and the impact was what we were expecting. In terms of what new workloads, I'll let Christian talk about that. There's been nothing but positive impact from our customers on these performance improvements. Yes. I'll add to that. I do think the next 6 months if things stay where they are, there could be interesting opportunities on the M&A front, not necessarily big M&A, but I do think the -- there's going to be some valuation resets on some of the private companies out there, that could create interesting opportunities. And that's where I'm saying there may be some opportunities, which areas that are on our roadmap where it may make sense to buy a team with some good technology, not necessarily, we're not looking for revenue, but good teams and technology at a more reasonable valuation. Yes. So just to be clear, we still are seeing our customers consume their contracted amount well within their contract period. Actually, one of our largest customers who signed a three-year $100 million deal, we've already invoiced them for their third year when we're still in the second year. And I don't see that changing for our customers because most of our customers have historically, and I still see that happening, consuming within their contract period. I just don't see that changing right now. The only thing that has changed and they're still growing, the growth rate that we've seen historically with some of these fast growth companies has slowed down. And I'm not going to give you the names on the conference call with those customers. Well, NRR is really driven by, a, our largest customers continuing to grow quite quickly, but also new customers that are coming into the cohort that are ramping. And this shouldn't surprise -- this is the real focus that we've had over the last two years seasonally and this is why this isn't about number of customers, quality customers. We have a lot of these large customers we've landed that are now in a two-year cohort that are ramping their usage of Snowflake. As I said in the past, I don't expect the net revenue retention to stay at this extremely high rate. I do think it will come down over time. It will come down gradually over time, but I don't see it increasing, and I mentioned that last quarter. And I do think that will continue to come down, but it will remain well above 130% for a very long time."

[Operator Instructions] I'll now hand you over to your host, Katherine McCracken, Senior Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKatherine McCracken: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Snowflake's Q4 fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me in Bozeman, Montana are Sridhar Ramaswamy, our Chief Executive Officer; Frank Slootman, our Chairman; Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer; and Christian Kleinerman, our Executive Vice President of Product, who will join us for the Q&A session. During today's call, we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, and discuss our guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2025. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our business operations and financial performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is available in our earnings press release, our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and our other SEC reports. All our statements are made as of today, based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks, Katherine. Welcome, and good afternoon. Right now, you've heard the great news about Sridhar becoming our next CEO. Before we get to that, I would like to highlight our fiscal 2024 results. FY '24 product revenue grew 38% year-over-year to reach $2.67 billion. Non-GAAP product gross margin expanded to 77.8%. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $810 million, representing 56% year-over-year growth. We continue to pair high growth with efficiency. The year began against an unsettled macroeconomic backdrop. We witnessed lackluster sentiment and customer hesitation due to lack of visibility in their businesses. Customers prefer to wait-and-see posture versus leaning in to longer-term contract expansions. This reversed in the second half of the year and we started seeing larger multi-year commitments. Q4 was an exceptionally strong bookings quarter. We reported $5.2 billion of remaining performance obligations, representing accelerated year-on-year growth of 41%. Our international theaters outperformed the company as a whole. We continue to see success in our effort to campaign the largest enterprises globally. We added 14 Global 2000s in the quarter, and eight of our top 10 customers grew sequentially. Meanwhile, Snowflake has announced many new technologies that let customers mobilize AI, Streamlit in Snowflake, Snowpark ML Modeling API, and Cortex ML functions are all generally available. We also received FedRAMP High authorization on the AWS GovCloud. This enables Snowflake to protect some of the Federal Government's most sensitive and classified data. Now, on the topic of CEO transition. I was brought to Snowflake five years ago to help the company breakout and scale. I wanted to grow the business fast, but not at all costs. It had to be efficient and establish a foundation for long-term growth. I believe the company succeeded on that mission. The Board has run a succession process that wasn't based on arbitrary timeline, but instead, looked for an opportunity to advance the company's mission, well into the future. The arrival of Sridhar Ramaswamy through the acquisition of Neeva last year represented that opportunity. Since joining us, Sridhar has been leading Snowflake's AI strategies, bringing new products and features to market at an incredible pace. He led the launch of Snowflake's Cortex, Snowflake's new fully-managed service that makes AI simple and secure. Prior to Neeva, Sridhar lead all of Google's advertising products. During his 15-year tenure at Google, he helped grow AdWords and Google's advertising business from $1.5 billion to over $100 billion. With the onslaught of generative AI, Snowflake needs a hard-driving technologist to navigate the challenges the new world represents. Sridhar's vision for the future and his proven ability to execute at scale made it clear to us as a Board, he is the right executive at the right time to lead Snowflake. This marks my retirement from an operating role. I will remain on duty as Chairman of the Board, and look forward to working with Sridhar and the team going forward. With that, I will pass it over to Sridhar.\nSridhar Ramaswamy: Thank you, Frank. I'm honored to have been chosen to lead this great company. The success that Snowflake has achieved is a testament to the great customers, employees, and partners who have contributed along the way. And of course, Frank has been a huge part of getting us here, which I gratefully acknowledge. Snowflake is a once-in-a-generation company that will revolutionize the world with its cloud data platform. This has become more true in the past year with the rapid technology innovations we have seen. Generative AI is at the forefront of my customer conversations. This drives renewed emphasis on data strategy in preparation of these new technologies. You heard the team say it many times, \"There's no AI strategy without a data strategy.\" And this has opened a massive opportunity for Snowflake to address. To deliver on the opportunity ahead, we must have clear focus and move even faster to bring innovation on the Snowflake platform to our customers and partners. This will be my focus. I look forward to working with the team, and I'm extremely excited for the opportunity. With that, I'll pass it over to Mike.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you, Sridhar. Q4 marked a strong finish to a challenging year. Product revenue was $738 million, growing 33% year-over-year. Similar to prior years, we experienced significant holiday impacts in December and January. Holidays make it difficult to discern meaningful consumption trends. In the quarter, younger customers led revenue growth. These accounts are adding new workloads in migrating from legacy vendors. Financial Services and retail were our largest revenue contributors, and we are seeing emerging momentum from the EMEA region and technology vertical. Customer optimizations returned to a normal level, with eight of our top 10 accounts growing sequentially. We proactively engaged with customers to help them optimize their Snowflake usage and we'll continue to do so. History has shown that optimizations expand our long-term opportunity. We now have 83 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $5 million, up from 75 in Q3. Q4 was an exceptional booking quarter for us. Bookings are not leading indicator of revenue; they do signal an improving macroenvironment. Remaining performance obligations grew 41% year-over-year to $5.2 billion. Of the $5.2 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 50% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. We signed our largest deal ever in Q4, a five-year, $250 million contract with an existing customer. Our international territories returned to meaningful growth, outperforming expectations for the first time in a year. We made significant progress in delivering margin expansion. Non-GAAP product margin at 78% was up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year, improved terms from the cloud service providers have contributed to margin expansion. Non-GAAP operating margin of 9% was ahead of expectations. Operating margin benefitted from increased hiring scrutiny. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 42%. Bookings outperformance increased collections. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments. We did not repurchase any shares in Q4. We have approximately $1.4 billion remaining under our original authorization of $2 billion. Now, let's turn to outlook. Consumption trends have improved since the beginning of last year, but have not returned to pre-FY '24 patterns. We have evolved our forecasting process to be more receptive to recent trends. For that reason, our guidance assumes similar customer behavior to fiscal 2024. We are forecasting increased revenue headwinds associated with product efficiency gains, tiered storage pricing and the expectation that some of our customers will leverage Iceberg Tables for their storage. We are not including potential revenue benefits from these initiatives in our forecast. These changes in our assumption impact our long-term guidance. Internally, we continue to march towards $10 billion in product revenue. Externally, we will not manage expectations to our previous targets until we have more data. We are focused in executing in FY '24 to ensure long-term durable growth. Now, turning to FY '25 guidance. For the first quarter, we expect product revenue between $745 million and $750 million, representing year-over-year growth between 26% and 27%. For the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 3%, and 366 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full year, we expect product revenue of approximately $3.25 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We expect Snowpark to contribute 3% of product revenue. We are not including any other new products in our forecast at this time. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP product gross margin of 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 6%, non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 29%, and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 368 million. We plan to add approximately 1,000 employees this year inclusive of M&A. For expenses, our forecast assumes meaningful investments in our AI initiatives. We expect approximately $50 million of GPU-related costs in fiscal year '25, approximately $10 million flowing through cost of product revenue. For the purpose of forecasting, we're not including any incremental revenue associated with these features. We've also evolved our go-to-market motion. As we compensate more reps on a consumption quota, we will see increased commission expense. Consumption-based commissions are expensed immediately rather than amortized over a five-year period. This has no impact on cash flows, but is expected to have approximately $30 million impact to P&L. Lastly, I would like to acknowledge Frank's retirement. Working with Frank for the past 17 years has been an incredible learning experience and I'm grateful for our time together. Frank's contributions to Snowflake has set the company up for long-term success and I look forward to being part of that journey. I have committed to Sridhar and the Board that I will be with Snowflake for at least the next three years. Before closing, we will host our Investor Day on June 4th in San Francisco in conjunction with Data Cloud Summit, our annual users conference. If you're interested in attending, please email ir@snowflake.com. With that operator, you can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Mark Murphy of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. So, Mike, I think with the understanding that bookings are not a perfect forward indicator of revenue, it's hard not to notice that total bookings performance is quite spectacular. And even the short-term backlog number looks good. I think if we try to bridge from that growing closer to 30% and then to arrive at the revenue growth in the low-20%s, I understand it's mechanically more complicated than that. But on the surface, it looks like you're guiding with a lot more conservatism than a year ago. So, I'm just wondering, does it feel -- does that part of this feel a little more comfortable to you, or do you think it could take a little longer to convert bookings to consumption this year?\nMike Scarpelli: I think we are definitely being more conservative this year given the consumption patterns we saw in '24. And as we said at our Analyst Day last year, we needed to see consumption patterns more in line with what we saw pre-'24 to get to our longer-term goal. And as a result, we've decided to forecast this year based upon the consumption patterns we saw in '24. And as you know, we forecast based upon historical consumption of our products. There's a lot of new products coming into GA and public preview this year that we have not taken into account in our forecast, and we will do so once we start to see that consumption. And so, we will take this quarter by quarter for the year.\nMark Murphy: Okay. And then, as a quick follow-up -- Frank, I wanted to thank you for everything, and wish you all the best. And Sridhar, just wanted to ask you because of your background in generative AI, do you envision any changes in the technology roadmap perhaps relating to Snowpark or perhaps your role in LLMs or how heavily you'd steer the go-to-market in those areas? I'm just wondering if there -- if you foresee any change in philosophy or approach.\nSridhar Ramaswamy: Yeah. I've had over 100 conversations with customers over the past year about generative AI in particular. And the product announcements that we've already made, things in private preview, including Snowflake Cortex, which is our managed AI and search layer combined with applications like Document AI for extracting structured data or our Copilot. These have been very well received. Document AI, for example, has hundreds of customers waiting for it to hit GA that are on our waitlist. So, I would say it is a matter of executing to the roadmap that we have already laid out. Cortex will hit public preview soon. To Mike's point, getting this to GA, getting this in the hands of our customers, and having them realize value is the top priority. I don't think of this as needing a new strategy.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Excellent. This is Steve on for Keith. Maybe to start off with one question on your consumption, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for where the consumption was softer as it is impacting your guidance. I think last quarter you gave us a good sense for digital native seem to stabilize, enterprise seem to get better. So, can you just kind of double-click where the consumption is softening now versus your expectations and where it may be stronger?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, as I said, the strength was in financial services. In retail, we are seeing the technology vertical do well. And I wouldn't say it's soft, we did beat the last quarter. But what I would say is, it's improving, but it's not back to the pre-2024 levels as I mentioned, and that's the -- we're basing -- we've revised our model to look at more recent history rather than going back too far in history for forecasting consumption patterns.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's very helpful. And then, one more follow-up on sort of the existing customer business and your net retention rate. That seemed to be on top of the bookings and other KPI that is at least getting better on the rate of change basis. Is there any level that you would guide us to in terms of where that net retention rate could stabilize? Is that informing your guide aside from kind of the consumption you're seeing in any meaningful way? Any color you can give us on that would be helpful too.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, as we've said before, over time, net revenue retention will converge with our revenue growth rate. And as I've said before, I'm not going to guide to net revenue retention.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Frank, all the best from me as well. A question for Sridhar. If you think about the customer conversations with AI and people will think differently about the data and the data platform. Can you speak a little bit about how do you see that playing out for you guys from a Snowflake perspective in terms of -- the one part that you have like the data warehouse, but also then more on the lake side? Like, what do you see, and what are you hearing in customer conversations, and how you're positioned now, and what would be the push for you there? And then, I have one follow-up for Mike.\nSridhar Ramaswamy: Yeah. On Snowflake Cortex, we are implementing it as a core platform layer. It ships with every deployment and it makes AI readily accessible from SQL, so that even an analyst that's not an LLM expert or a Python expert can simply write SQL for things like summarization or sentiment detection data that is already in Snowflake. Our overall aspiration here is to make AI really, really simple for our customers to use. And in some sense, the prototypical AI application is a chatbot over a specialized corpus using what's called a RAG, retrieval augmented generation. But the idea is basically you're able to, say, talk to your documentation or talk to the support cases that you have, and get answers back in natural language, but with things like citations, so you can actually believe the answers that are coming back from the chatbot. So, both of these are ready-made applications that our customers are excited about. But I would say the big, big unlock is being able to get at the structured data that is in Snowflake and have that be accessed by many, many more people. Today, people go through an elaborate process of getting the data ready, using BI tool, going through a pretty slow cycle. And so, the things that we're driving towards is creating easy ways for people to be able to talk to subsets of data, like Mike to be able to talk to finance data, or other things like that. I would say that that is the thing that is truly, truly exciting for our customers. And with respect to where data is sitting, as you know, we support things like Iceberg formats. It is getting more and more popular. So, data interoperability is very much a thing and our AI products can generally act on data that is sitting in cloud storage as well. So, the solutions that we're offering as part of Snowflake are broadly applicable both to data within Snowflake, but also data that's sitting in cloud storage.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you. And then, Mike, a quick question for you on the gross margin side. Congrats on the amazing improvement here. Is that -- did I understand you correctly that just one hyperscaler where the contract terms kind of got improved and is that something that we could kind of hope for others, or is the level now at the level? Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: So, as a reminder, we did AWS and Azure before our Investor Day last year. We just did our Google contract last quarter as well. So, all three of those contracts now, and those are where we are running in those three clouds are current. And I don't expect any changes to those terms in any meaningful way in the short term.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. That answers it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Yeah. Thanks very much. And Frank, congrats on a great run at Snowflake and before. Mike, maybe for you, every year, you've told us that you'd always include technology advancements that you passed back to customers. In your guidance, it seems like there's a higher level of conservatism around that, just given the lack of visibility on that. Can you try to, I guess, qualitatively give us some idea of how much bigger a headwind that is than prior years just to go along with some of the conservatism around consumption trends?\nMike Scarpelli: It's about a 6.2%, 6.3% impact this year. But coupled with that too in the revenue, we rolled out in Q4 tiered storage pricing. So, the amount of revenue associated with storage is coming down. But on top of that, we do expect a number of our large customers are going to adopt Iceberg formats and move their data out of Snowflake where we lose that storage revenue and also the compute revenue associated with moving that data into Snowflake. We do expect, though, there'll be more workloads that will move to us, but until we see that incremental revenue on workloads, we're not going to forecast that. I will say last year, we saw a 62% increase in the number of jobs running on Snowflake year-over-year with a corresponding 33% increase in revenue. And that's because we continue to show our customers that we become cheaper and cheaper to them every year. And when we do that, it opens up new workload opportunities for us, and we'll continue to do that.\nKirk Materne: Okay. That's great. I'll leave it there. Sridhar, congrats on the new position. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question for today comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Mike, I just want to reconcile a really good RPO close acceleration in Q4 and then how you marry that with the guide. I think there's a lot of questions about the acceleration you saw and perhaps why that may not flow through into next year.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I would say, we signed a lot of large multi-year deals in Q4. I mentioned the one that was a five-year $250 million deal. There is -- and so, when customers -- what that really shows is the commitment customers are making to Snowflake. And from a customers' perspective, as long as they use that -- those credits up within their contract period, they're fine. There is a lot of pent-up demand for a lot of our new products that are coming out. Sridhar talked about Document AI. We have a lot of customers that want Cortex and Snowpark Container Services. So, I think it's going to be more back-end loaded this year. And until we see that consumption by our customers, it's hard to forecast that. So, stay tuned.\nBrent Thill: Okay. And Mike, just on linearity in Q4, I know the holidays were the holidays, but did you see things bounce back similar to what you've seen historically in Q4, or was there anything unique closing out the quarter?\nMike Scarpelli: Are you talking from a revenue, or are you talking of bookings? Bookings was very strong in January. I would say from a revenue consumption pattern, I think there was a little bit more of a prolonged holiday that went into mid-January. Coming out of January, consumption is good, but once again and through today, but it's more in line with 2024 consumption versus the pre-'24 consumption patterns.\nBrent Thill: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is [Allan on] (ph). Mike, just as a follow-up about consumption in the quarter, I'd love to maybe get a comparison on February. I know we got a day left, but maybe how this month shaped out compared to February of last year? And then, I've got a quick follow-up. And that's from a consumption perspective.\nMike Scarpelli: So, the consumption is tracking where we are, and I just gave guidance for the quarter. So, I don't know what else you want me to tell you.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And as a follow-up, I guess, you talked about some of the free cash flow impacts from the go-to-market change around pushing consumption more. Is there any way we should be thinking about maybe the top-line impacts as a result of that with the guide? Thanks.\nMike Scarpelli: What I was talking about was cash flow was the switch in the comp plan from paying people on consumption versus the booking. And it doesn't really change the free cash -- the cash flow associated because we're still doing the payments the same. And it has a $30 million P&L impact, but no cash flow impact is what I was referring to. And obviously, one of the reasons why we switched to paying reps more in consumption is because we want reps to be driving revenue more rather than bookings necessarily. And our reps are heavily compensated on two things this year. You have approximately 35% of our reps are focused just on initial new customers, 55% are just paid on existing customers with driving consumption, identifying new workloads within customers. We have about 10% that are in a hybrid, a mix of new customers and consumption, and those are more in emerging territories or territories where maybe the installed base of customers isn't as high.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. Good afternoon. Frank, I'll -- well wishes here in retirement. I'll forever remember you -- working with you on the first IPO and the last one here. It's been an amazing 17-year journey. Mike, glad to know you'll be with us for another three years. My question here is for Sridhar. As we think about driving more AI workloads to the Snowflake platform, what's the tip of the spear going forward? Is it Cortex? Is it Snowpark? Help us understand what you're focused on accelerating AI workloads to Snowflake.\nSridhar Ramaswamy: Yeah. When it comes to AI, as I was outlining, first of all, simplifying it so that it is easy for our customers to use [via] (ph) Cortex is the very first thing. And a lot of things that you and I, like analysts do with text now becomes so much easier to do with language models of different sizes. But I would say the applications that truly drive customer excitement that there is incredible demand for are on the Document AI side and on the Copilot offering. They're different, but they use the same underlying technologies. Document AI is about extracting structured information from unstructured documents like PDFs that every enterprise has boatloads of. And then, on the other side, Copilot finally makes real the possibility of like being able to just talk to your data, ask questions in natural language and for that to get translated underneath to SQL -- for that SQL to be run against Snowflake and for you to get back a tabular answer and then soon visualizations as well. It's that kind of fluid access that customers are really, really excited by. And what you get from Snowflake is that this comes out of the box. This is very easy. You can build a Streamlit app with it. And so, it avoids all of the complicated exfiltration of data using other tools, needing to stitch things together as an IT project in order to get something done. And that's the power of our platform where we know the data. We know the schema. We know all the previous queries that have been run against it and are, therefore, able to create a very effective Copilot solution. So hopefully, that gives you a flavor for the kinds of conversations that we've been having with customers and what they're looking forward.\nBrent Bracelin: Very helpful there. And then, Mike, if I just look at the guide on a per customer basis, it does look like consumption per customer could be slower this year than last year. What's the delta there? Is the primary delta the assumption that tiered storage pricing and Iceberg will put more pressure on consumption growth? Is that the primary delta, or is there something else I'm missing?\nMike Scarpelli: No. There's a lot of new performance enhancements being rolled out on our software this year that are going to have an impact. There's also -- well, I'll tell you, but I really don't want to because I know you're going to ask a lot of questions. We're also rolling out the Arm chip in the Azure. It's not as big as AWS as an impact that will impact that as well too. And clearly, we do expect customers will begin to adopt Iceberg Table format.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. So, Mike, one for you, and one for you, Sridhar. Mike, how much of the conservatism is due to the transition at the senior most level? And one you Sridhar. Congratulations. What are the biggest challenges and opportunities facing Snowflake in your opinion? Thank you so much, once again.\nMike Scarpelli: I don't know how to answer that question, Kash. But what I would say is I'd like to set the company up to be successful throughout the year as we progress with Sridhar coming on board.\nSridhar Ramaswamy: Yeah. And to answer your question, Kash, as you know, like Frank, our Founders have built Snowflake to be the trusted efficient and cost-effective platform for enterprises. So, I'm standing on the shoulder of giants to take us to the next chapter. And we already have a pretty ambitious plan, for example, to be able to write applications on top of Snowflake on those underlying technologies, native applications, container services or rolling out to GA this year. And then, I would add what is unique about this moment in technology, of course, is AI and its power to democratize access to enterprise data. I think this dramatically changes our understanding and notions of what an application is, all things can be stitched together. I think it is that a data platform, combined with applications, with AI powering things like interoperability, that I think is the biggest opportunity in front of us. And we have a ton of investments, as I said, many of them are coming to GA. Getting them out quickly and driving adoption is easily my highest priority. And in terms of challenges, some of these were deep platform surgeries. Unistore, as you folks know, is an incredibly ambitious project that has never been done before. But it will roll out. So, I think you're going to see us realize a lot of benefits of the investments that we've been making in the core technology platform over the last two years. But as you know, AI is also moving at lightning speed. We have an amazing team that's at work on it. But I think there's just lots more disruption to the software landscape to come. And that's why acting with speed and urgency is especially important for us.\nKash Rangan: Awesome. Excited to be on this journey with you, Sridhar. Congratulations. And thank you, Mike.\nSridhar Ramaswamy: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Colville of Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Colville: All right. Thank you for taking my question. Under Frank's leadership, Snowflake has undoubtedly been a bit of a rocket ship. So Frank, I want to ask you, why leave now? And then, Sridhar, I can ask you on as well. Looking forward to you being in-charge for exiting next steps, how are you thinking about your strategy for Snowflake and changes you want to make now that you're in the CEO position? I've got a quick follow-up, if that's all right?\nFrank Slootman: Yeah. The important thing that I tried to highlight in the prepared remarks was that we haven't run succession as a time-based process. And I say, \"Why ask now?\" It's not a timing issue. It is, \"Do we have the person that we think is going to be an incredible win for the company going forward?\" And that's not -- you can't dictate that or mandate that. That is just based on opportunities that will or will not present themselves. So, we feel incredibly fortunate that we cross path with Sridhar through acquisition of Neeva. If I think of myself not just as the former CEO of Snowflake, but also as an individual shareholder in Snowflake, this is the move I want to make at this time. And I cannot tell you as an investor, how strong we used to feel about succession. This is not about -- just about changing the guard. This is also about positioning the company really, really well for the challenges that are coming at us.\nSridhar Ramaswamy: Yeah. And just adding on to what Frank said just now, our short-term goals are very clear. As I said, we have a slew of product enhancements and everything from like transactional systems like Unistore, to interoperable storage, to making applications on top of our data cloud possible with native applications and container services and, of course, AI on top of that. So, I think the short term and the need to react pretty quickly to a very quick silver AI landscape is what I'm going to be focused on. But I would almost say that, that actually translates pretty well into a longer-term strategy. Our belief is that a cloud that starts with data at the center combined with our product philosophy of creating a tightly integrated, easy-to-use product is the long-term winning strategy. Yes, there are going to be details that are different about which are the applications that we are going to be developing, what are ones that we are going to be doing in partnership, but that combination of the data cloud applications built on top of it with AI as an orchestrator is actually a pretty solid long-term strategy as well. Of course, as I said, we have to be adaptive because the world of AI and its capabilities are changing by the month. And so, we have to be receptive to that kind of change. But I feel very good about the path that we have set out for ourselves in how effective it's going to be both in the short term and the long term.\nPatrick Colville: Prefect. Thank you, Frank and Sridhar. Mike, can I just -- one quick one for you. You gave the guidance about 3 points of product revenue will be from Snowpark in 1Q. Thanks for that color.\nMike Scarpelli: For the year.\nPatrick Colville: I guess my question...\nMike Scarpelli: For the year.\nPatrick Colville: For the year, okay. Fiscal '25, okay. When might Snowpark hockey stick? It's been a product you guys have been talking about and invested pretty heavily in. It's seen terrific momentum. But can we expect the hockey stick at some point?\nMike Scarpelli: Anything is possible. What I would say is we did about mid-$30 million in revenue, I think $35 million, $36 million in revenue last year associated with Snowpark. Clearly, what I'm saying 3% is going to be just under $100 million, $95 million or so this year. I think that is pretty phenomenal growth. And if we can get it to grow faster, we obviously will.\nPatrick Colville: All right, keep up the good work. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills of Bank of America. Brad, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. This is Carly on for Brad. I guess, first question, just wanted to ask on your guide for the full year. Fiscal year '25, I think you assumed a number of large customers going to adopt Iceberg Table. So, some expectation on data moving out of Snowflake losing some storage revenue and some compute revenue there. Can you just double-click on that why some of the existing large customers are going to choose Iceberg Table rather than their original?\nMike Scarpelli: A lot of big customers want to have open file formats, to give them the options. And by the way, this is not necessarily customers moving all of their storage out of Snowflake, but a lot of the growth in their storage will be put into Iceberg Tables is what we think is going to happen. So, you're just not going to see the growth associated with the storage in many of those customers. As a reminder, about 10% to 11% of our overall revenue is associated with storage.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. And then, just a follow-up on -- I guess, on the -- it's like encouraging to know 3% of the contribution will be from Snowpark. And then, at the same time, you guys are expecting some headwinds from Iceberg and also the tiered storage pricing. Can you just quantify for us what's like headwinds for the storage pricing in the Iceberg Table for the fiscal -- for the full year?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, it's built into our guidance. I'm not going to break them out all separately. I would say the performance improvements, which have nothing to do with that, around 6.2%, 6.3%.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. And then, I think you said the consumption is going to be like similar to fiscal year '24.\nMike Scarpelli: We're forecasting consumption patterns similar to what we saw in '24.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I guess following up on the Snowpark conversation, it feels like $35 million going to $100 million is, like you said, Mike, that is good growth. Could you talk a little bit more about sort of what the customer feedback has been? It feels like pipeline, it's like every check you do, Snowpark is in the conversation. So maybe just double-click on what that customer feedback has been and how encouraged you are with the pipeline growth there?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yeah, hi. Christian here. The feedback has been very strongly positive. What we hear more often is better economics and better performance, but probably more important, more simplicity into how data doesn't have to be moved between systems and it's just an integrated solution. Some of the enhancements that you see apply not only to data engineering, but also to traditional machine learning, which we see an increasing number of use cases also being deployed. So, the sentiment is very positive.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. Thanks. And Mike, maybe just one other, just to double-click on the guidance philosophy. You said consumption patterns from '24 is what influencing your '25 guidance. I'm curious -- and it feels like consumption has improved as '24 progressed. Are you sort of weighting it more towards like what you saw in the first half of the year or more sort of like some of the better trends you saw in the second half? Or just maybe double-clicking on a little bit on kind of what those fiscal '24 assumptions, because it feels like things have gotten better as the year progressed?\nMike Scarpelli: I would say it's more the average of '24, which we saw stability happen in our customer base. I'm not forecasting any type of recovery inside there.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. And I want to direct this question at Sridhar, maybe Christian can jump in. But just as we think about the product roadmap for FY '25, you talked a little about Unistore, Container Services, Cortex. Can you just put an update on when you expect these products to go GA? What you're seeing in terms of customer momentum? Any customer statistics you can call out? And then, how do you just kind of think about the maturity of these products, Sridhar, now that you've had time to look at the progress of these? Are you still expecting these to be contributors by year-end? Thank you.\nSridhar Ramaswamy: I'll give a brief initial answer and then have Christian take over from there. One of the things that the Snowflake team is very, very good at doing is making sure that everything that we ship is tightly integrated with everything else. There's just fluid interoperability between our various features, and that is also rock solid. I think that culture of integrated and well-built features is a hallmark of Snowflake. Of course, in areas like AI, which is moving at lightning speed, we want a stable infrastructure, but we also need to be flexible enough, whether it's new models that we put inside Cortex or other functionality that we need to develop on top of it. But a lot of the core investments that the team has made to allow for this kind of extensibility is what is coming in handy for us in terms of being able to ship things with speed. I'll hand it off to Christian to talk about when he expects different things to hit GA. Christian?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yeah. So, as both Sridhar and Mike mentioned, we expect a number of meaningful GA milestones this fiscal year, starting with generative AI, Cortex will be in public preview very soon, and we expect it to be generally available on and around the Summit's timeframe. And as Sridhar said, we expect all sorts of interesting use cases of generative AI coming to the data and preserving privacy and security. Snowpark Container Services is already in public preview in AWS, and we expect it to be generally available in that same timeframe, give or take a couple of months from Summit. And is the ultimate extensibility capability for bringing computation into Snowflake. Iceberg Tables is already on public preview across all three clouds, and will be generally available again, also in the Data Cloud Summit timeframe. Unistore, which enables combining transactional and analytical capabilities in single applications went very recently into public preview in AWS and will be generally available in the second half of the year. And Native Apps, which is how we accelerate time to value for both partners and customers is clearly GA on AWS and Azure, and we're continuing to round up the enhancement. So, this is imminent, and we expect a strong showing of product capabilities at the Data Cloud Summit.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thanks. And a follow-up for Mike. Just in terms of what you've seen so far in February, and I know you're taking about FY '25 consumptions -- assumptions consistent with a year ago. But have you seen February trends improve relative to January? Does February feel similar to February a year ago, or is it closer to the strong growth that you saw in consumption towards the end of last year?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, I just guided for February, well, for the quarter, and that reflects the consumption trends we've been seeing through yesterday. So, I would say it's more in line with what we saw coming out last year throughout on average for the year.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Cikos of Needham & Co. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMike Cikos: Hey, thanks for getting me on here, guys. And I did just want to follow up. I guess one of the dominant messages from management, if I just go back a quarter ago, really seem to be the theme about the growing use of unstructured data by your customers. And I don't know if it's just my read here, but it feels like it's a more muted message today. Maybe I'm missing something. But can you just put some finer points here as far as the trends that Snowflake is seeing specifically around unstructured data in Q4? And then, I did have a follow-up.\nChristian Kleinerman: Christian here. The momentum that we shared in the last quarter has carried forward on to this quarter. So, there is no change in pace or interest. And if anything, the Document AI that Sridhar mentioned earlier in the call, where we have hundreds of customers lined up to be able to leverage this technology is all about extracting value and signal from unstructured documents. So, the fact that it was not mentioned is not anything that should be read into. It is still a topic of high interest among many of our customers.\nMike Cikos: Got it. And I know that you guys have these assumptions as well in the guidance around the potential headwinds from some of your larger customers adopting or moving data to Iceberg. Maybe to parse through that a little bit, can you talk about what you've seen thus far as far as customers' behavior? Are they already doing this with Iceberg? Or is it just an assumption that you guys have? I'm trying to get a sense as far as the behavior customers have exhibited as well as how much you guys are peppering into your guidance today when we think about that headwind as well as the rollout of tiered storage?\nMike Scarpelli: Yeah. Iceberg is not GA yet. So, customers are not going to roll that into production until it's GA, and we do think it will be a gradual process of if they're going to move data out. But as soon as it's GA, new data can go into Iceberg Table. And we don't expect that to be GA until sometime around June timeframe.\nMike Cikos: Okay. And so, just to put a finer point on that though, the headwind we're expecting from Iceberg, this is theoretical, you have not seen that behavior from customers just yet?\nMike Scarpelli: Correct. It is what we are expecting. I know the tiered -- the new toward -- tiered storage pricing that we rolled out we're seeing that today. And I'll let Christian add some to that as well, too.\nChristian Kleinerman: Yeah. I would add that for many of our large customers, we have been in touch on their plans for adoption on Iceberg. So, some of what see in our guidance has factored in those intentions.\nMike Cikos: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. Maybe one on hiring. I think you mentioned 1,000 net new heads you're expecting to add in the coming year. How are you balancing, adding to R&D given all the new product efforts and AI interest with bringing on sales capacity if the market does start to turn? And on the FedRAMP High authorization, any commentary around that, what that could open up and if that's an area of potential investment as well? Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: I would say a lot of our expensive hiring is in the R&D area and it will continue to be more in the AI/ML space. These engineers are very expensive. With that said, we're still adding in the sales organization. And if we see an uptick in new customers and consumption patterns with our customers, we can easily dial that up just like we've dialed back our hiring in the past. But we are not going to sacrifice on R&D.\nMichael Turrin: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derrick Wood of TD Cowen. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDerrick Wood: Thanks. Mike, most other cloud consumption vendors are talking about stabilizing growth. You guys are still modeling pretty sharp deceleration over the next year. So, this certainly sticks out and may bring about questions on maybe company-specific challenges. So first, are there any notable customer or workload losses that could be weighing on growth this year? And generally, how are you feeling about sales productivity and competitive win rates in the current environment?\nMike Scarpelli: Absolutely no big competitive losses or workloads moving off that I'm aware of. This is all related to our model where a lot of the performance improvements that we have in our software go directly to the customer. And that's why I was pointing out you saw there was a 62% year-over-year growth in jobs on a daily basis run on Snowflake versus only a 33% revenue growth. And we know there's a lot of performance improvements coming into play this year, coupled with Iceberg, coupled with tiered storage pricing that we rolled out. And I was able to roll out the tiered storage pricing because we were getting much better pricing out of the cloud vendors to us.\nDerrick Wood: Yeah. Okay. It would be interesting to kind of see what the growth rates on just the workloads related to compute is relative to the storage drag. Maybe that's something you could give. But just how do you feel about ultimately kind of getting back to 30% growth longer term? And kind of what's the top one or two critical things that need to take place to get you there?\nMike Scarpelli: I would say the biggest thing is the uptick in consumption associated with all the new enhancements we have in our product, in particular, what we could see coming out of Cortex, we could see coming out of Snowpark Container Services, and ultimately, what we could see in Native App development on our platform.\nDerrick Wood: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gray Powell of BTIG. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nGray Powell: Okay. Great. Thank you for taking the question. I just had a quick follow-up on Snowpark. I think you called out Snowpark at a $70 million annual run rate one day back in December. I know that was sort of like a one-day statistic. But I'm just trying to think through that. I mean, the guide of 3% of revenue for fiscal '25, that's like $95 million, $100 million. I guess it just seems kind of conservative given that Snowpark was -- or that consumption of Snowpark was growing 45% quarter-over-quarter last quarter. Just how should we think about the level of conservatism on that assumption within your guidance?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, what I'm saying is we're guiding it to be 3% of product revenue this year, and you can infer what you want from the guidance.\nGray Powell: Well, all right then. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take no further questions for today. So, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Christian Kleinerman",
            "content": "Yeah, hi. Christian here. The feedback has been very strongly positive. What we hear more often is better economics and better performance, but probably more important, more simplicity into how data doesn't have to be moved between systems and it's just an integrated solution. Some of the enhancements that you see apply not only to data engineering, but also to traditional machine learning, which we see an increasing number of use cases also being deployed. So, the sentiment is very positive. Yeah. So, as both Sridhar and Mike mentioned, we expect a number of meaningful GA milestones this fiscal year, starting with generative AI, Cortex will be in public preview very soon, and we expect it to be generally available on and around the Summit's timeframe. And as Sridhar said, we expect all sorts of interesting use cases of generative AI coming to the data and preserving privacy and security. Snowpark Container Services is already in public preview in AWS, and we expect it to be generally available in that same timeframe, give or take a couple of months from Summit. And is the ultimate extensibility capability for bringing computation into Snowflake. Iceberg Tables is already on public preview across all three clouds, and will be generally available again, also in the Data Cloud Summit timeframe. Unistore, which enables combining transactional and analytical capabilities in single applications went very recently into public preview in AWS and will be generally available in the second half of the year. And Native Apps, which is how we accelerate time to value for both partners and customers is clearly GA on AWS and Azure, and we're continuing to round up the enhancement. So, this is imminent, and we expect a strong showing of product capabilities at the Data Cloud Summit. Christian here. The momentum that we shared in the last quarter has carried forward on to this quarter. So, there is no change in pace or interest. And if anything, the Document AI that Sridhar mentioned earlier in the call, where we have hundreds of customers lined up to be able to leverage this technology is all about extracting value and signal from unstructured documents. So, the fact that it was not mentioned is not anything that should be read into. It is still a topic of high interest among many of our customers. Yeah. I would add that for many of our large customers, we have been in touch on their plans for adoption on Iceberg. So, some of what see in our guidance has factored in those intentions."

            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks, Katherine. Welcome, and good afternoon. Right now, you've heard the great news about Sridhar becoming our next CEO. Before we get to that, I would like to highlight our fiscal 2024 results. FY '24 product revenue grew 38% year-over-year to reach $2.67 billion. Non-GAAP product gross margin expanded to 77.8%. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $810 million, representing 56% year-over-year growth. We continue to pair high growth with efficiency. The year began against an unsettled macroeconomic backdrop. We witnessed lackluster sentiment and customer hesitation due to lack of visibility in their businesses. Customers prefer to wait-and-see posture versus leaning in to longer-term contract expansions. This reversed in the second half of the year and we started seeing larger multi-year commitments. Q4 was an exceptionally strong bookings quarter. We reported $5.2 billion of remaining performance obligations, representing accelerated year-on-year growth of 41%. Our international theaters outperformed the company as a whole. We continue to see success in our effort to campaign the largest enterprises globally. We added 14 Global 2000s in the quarter, and eight of our top 10 customers grew sequentially. Meanwhile, Snowflake has announced many new technologies that let customers mobilize AI, Streamlit in Snowflake, Snowpark ML Modeling API, and Cortex ML functions are all generally available. We also received FedRAMP High authorization on the AWS GovCloud. This enables Snowflake to protect some of the Federal Government's most sensitive and classified data. Now, on the topic of CEO transition. I was brought to Snowflake five years ago to help the company breakout and scale. I wanted to grow the business fast, but not at all costs. It had to be efficient and establish a foundation for long-term growth. I believe the company succeeded on that mission. The Board has run a succession process that wasn't based on arbitrary timeline, but instead, looked for an opportunity to advance the company's mission, well into the future. The arrival of Sridhar Ramaswamy through the acquisition of Neeva last year represented that opportunity. Since joining us, Sridhar has been leading Snowflake's AI strategies, bringing new products and features to market at an incredible pace. He led the launch of Snowflake's Cortex, Snowflake's new fully-managed service that makes AI simple and secure. Prior to Neeva, Sridhar lead all of Google's advertising products. During his 15-year tenure at Google, he helped grow AdWords and Google's advertising business from $1.5 billion to over $100 billion. With the onslaught of generative AI, Snowflake needs a hard-driving technologist to navigate the challenges the new world represents. Sridhar's vision for the future and his proven ability to execute at scale made it clear to us as a Board, he is the right executive at the right time to lead Snowflake. This marks my retirement from an operating role. I will remain on duty as Chairman of the Board, and look forward to working with Sridhar and the team going forward. With that, I will pass it over to Sridhar. Yeah. The important thing that I tried to highlight in the prepared remarks was that we haven't run succession as a time-based process. And I say, \"Why ask now?\" It's not a timing issue. It is, \"Do we have the person that we think is going to be an incredible win for the company going forward?\" And that's not -- you can't dictate that or mandate that. That is just based on opportunities that will or will not present themselves. So, we feel incredibly fortunate that we cross path with Sridhar through acquisition of Neeva. If I think of myself not just as the former CEO of Snowflake, but also as an individual shareholder in Snowflake, this is the move I want to make at this time. And I cannot tell you as an investor, how strong we used to feel about succession. This is not about -- just about changing the guard. This is also about positioning the company really, really well for the challenges that are coming at us."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Sridhar Ramaswamy",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. I'm honored to have been chosen to lead this great company. The success that Snowflake has achieved is a testament to the great customers, employees, and partners who have contributed along the way. And of course, Frank has been a huge part of getting us here, which I gratefully acknowledge. Snowflake is a once-in-a-generation company that will revolutionize the world with its cloud data platform. This has become more true in the past year with the rapid technology innovations we have seen. Generative AI is at the forefront of my customer conversations. This drives renewed emphasis on data strategy in preparation of these new technologies. You heard the team say it many times, \"There's no AI strategy without a data strategy.\" And this has opened a massive opportunity for Snowflake to address. To deliver on the opportunity ahead, we must have clear focus and move even faster to bring innovation on the Snowflake platform to our customers and partners. This will be my focus. I look forward to working with the team, and I'm extremely excited for the opportunity. With that, I'll pass it over to Mike. Yeah. I've had over 100 conversations with customers over the past year about generative AI in particular. And the product announcements that we've already made, things in private preview, including Snowflake Cortex, which is our managed AI and search layer combined with applications like Document AI for extracting structured data or our Copilot. These have been very well received. Document AI, for example, has hundreds of customers waiting for it to hit GA that are on our waitlist. So, I would say it is a matter of executing to the roadmap that we have already laid out. Cortex will hit public preview soon. To Mike's point, getting this to GA, getting this in the hands of our customers, and having them realize value is the top priority. I don't think of this as needing a new strategy. Yeah. On Snowflake Cortex, we are implementing it as a core platform layer. It ships with every deployment and it makes AI readily accessible from SQL, so that even an analyst that's not an LLM expert or a Python expert can simply write SQL for things like summarization or sentiment detection data that is already in Snowflake. Our overall aspiration here is to make AI really, really simple for our customers to use. And in some sense, the prototypical AI application is a chatbot over a specialized corpus using what's called a RAG, retrieval augmented generation. But the idea is basically you're able to, say, talk to your documentation or talk to the support cases that you have, and get answers back in natural language, but with things like citations, so you can actually believe the answers that are coming back from the chatbot. So, both of these are ready-made applications that our customers are excited about. But I would say the big, big unlock is being able to get at the structured data that is in Snowflake and have that be accessed by many, many more people. Today, people go through an elaborate process of getting the data ready, using BI tool, going through a pretty slow cycle. And so, the things that we're driving towards is creating easy ways for people to be able to talk to subsets of data, like Mike to be able to talk to finance data, or other things like that. I would say that that is the thing that is truly, truly exciting for our customers. And with respect to where data is sitting, as you know, we support things like Iceberg formats. It is getting more and more popular. So, data interoperability is very much a thing and our AI products can generally act on data that is sitting in cloud storage as well. So, the solutions that we're offering as part of Snowflake are broadly applicable both to data within Snowflake, but also data that's sitting in cloud storage. Yeah. When it comes to AI, as I was outlining, first of all, simplifying it so that it is easy for our customers to use [via] (ph) Cortex is the very first thing. And a lot of things that you and I, like analysts do with text now becomes so much easier to do with language models of different sizes. But I would say the applications that truly drive customer excitement that there is incredible demand for are on the Document AI side and on the Copilot offering. They're different, but they use the same underlying technologies. Document AI is about extracting structured information from unstructured documents like PDFs that every enterprise has boatloads of. And then, on the other side, Copilot finally makes real the possibility of like being able to just talk to your data, ask questions in natural language and for that to get translated underneath to SQL -- for that SQL to be run against Snowflake and for you to get back a tabular answer and then soon visualizations as well. It's that kind of fluid access that customers are really, really excited by. And what you get from Snowflake is that this comes out of the box. This is very easy. You can build a Streamlit app with it. And so, it avoids all of the complicated exfiltration of data using other tools, needing to stitch things together as an IT project in order to get something done. And that's the power of our platform where we know the data. We know the schema. We know all the previous queries that have been run against it and are, therefore, able to create a very effective Copilot solution. So hopefully, that gives you a flavor for the kinds of conversations that we've been having with customers and what they're looking forward. Yeah. And to answer your question, Kash, as you know, like Frank, our Founders have built Snowflake to be the trusted efficient and cost-effective platform for enterprises. So, I'm standing on the shoulder of giants to take us to the next chapter. And we already have a pretty ambitious plan, for example, to be able to write applications on top of Snowflake on those underlying technologies, native applications, container services or rolling out to GA this year. And then, I would add what is unique about this moment in technology, of course, is AI and its power to democratize access to enterprise data. I think this dramatically changes our understanding and notions of what an application is, all things can be stitched together. I think it is that a data platform, combined with applications, with AI powering things like interoperability, that I think is the biggest opportunity in front of us. And we have a ton of investments, as I said, many of them are coming to GA. Getting them out quickly and driving adoption is easily my highest priority. And in terms of challenges, some of these were deep platform surgeries. Unistore, as you folks know, is an incredibly ambitious project that has never been done before. But it will roll out. So, I think you're going to see us realize a lot of benefits of the investments that we've been making in the core technology platform over the last two years. But as you know, AI is also moving at lightning speed. We have an amazing team that's at work on it. But I think there's just lots more disruption to the software landscape to come. And that's why acting with speed and urgency is especially important for us. Thank you, Kash. Yeah. And just adding on to what Frank said just now, our short-term goals are very clear. As I said, we have a slew of product enhancements and everything from like transactional systems like Unistore, to interoperable storage, to making applications on top of our data cloud possible with native applications and container services and, of course, AI on top of that. So, I think the short term and the need to react pretty quickly to a very quick silver AI landscape is what I'm going to be focused on. But I would almost say that, that actually translates pretty well into a longer-term strategy. Our belief is that a cloud that starts with data at the center combined with our product philosophy of creating a tightly integrated, easy-to-use product is the long-term winning strategy. Yes, there are going to be details that are different about which are the applications that we are going to be developing, what are ones that we are going to be doing in partnership, but that combination of the data cloud applications built on top of it with AI as an orchestrator is actually a pretty solid long-term strategy as well. Of course, as I said, we have to be adaptive because the world of AI and its capabilities are changing by the month. And so, we have to be receptive to that kind of change. But I feel very good about the path that we have set out for ourselves in how effective it's going to be both in the short term and the long term. I'll give a brief initial answer and then have Christian take over from there. One of the things that the Snowflake team is very, very good at doing is making sure that everything that we ship is tightly integrated with everything else. There's just fluid interoperability between our various features, and that is also rock solid. I think that culture of integrated and well-built features is a hallmark of Snowflake. Of course, in areas like AI, which is moving at lightning speed, we want a stable infrastructure, but we also need to be flexible enough, whether it's new models that we put inside Cortex or other functionality that we need to develop on top of it. But a lot of the core investments that the team has made to allow for this kind of extensibility is what is coming in handy for us in terms of being able to ship things with speed. I'll hand it off to Christian to talk about when he expects different things to hit GA. Christian?"

            "content": "Thank you, Sridhar. Q4 marked a strong finish to a challenging year. Product revenue was $738 million, growing 33% year-over-year. Similar to prior years, we experienced significant holiday impacts in December and January. Holidays make it difficult to discern meaningful consumption trends. In the quarter, younger customers led revenue growth. These accounts are adding new workloads in migrating from legacy vendors. Financial Services and retail were our largest revenue contributors, and we are seeing emerging momentum from the EMEA region and technology vertical. Customer optimizations returned to a normal level, with eight of our top 10 accounts growing sequentially. We proactively engaged with customers to help them optimize their Snowflake usage and we'll continue to do so. History has shown that optimizations expand our long-term opportunity. We now have 83 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $5 million, up from 75 in Q3. Q4 was an exceptional booking quarter for us. Bookings are not leading indicator of revenue; they do signal an improving macroenvironment. Remaining performance obligations grew 41% year-over-year to $5.2 billion. Of the $5.2 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 50% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. We signed our largest deal ever in Q4, a five-year, $250 million contract with an existing customer. Our international territories returned to meaningful growth, outperforming expectations for the first time in a year. We made significant progress in delivering margin expansion. Non-GAAP product margin at 78% was up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year, improved terms from the cloud service providers have contributed to margin expansion. Non-GAAP operating margin of 9% was ahead of expectations. Operating margin benefitted from increased hiring scrutiny. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 42%. Bookings outperformance increased collections. We ended the quarter with $4.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments. We did not repurchase any shares in Q4. We have approximately $1.4 billion remaining under our original authorization of $2 billion. Now, let's turn to outlook. Consumption trends have improved since the beginning of last year, but have not returned to pre-FY '24 patterns. We have evolved our forecasting process to be more receptive to recent trends. For that reason, our guidance assumes similar customer behavior to fiscal 2024. We are forecasting increased revenue headwinds associated with product efficiency gains, tiered storage pricing and the expectation that some of our customers will leverage Iceberg Tables for their storage. We are not including potential revenue benefits from these initiatives in our forecast. These changes in our assumption impact our long-term guidance. Internally, we continue to march towards $10 billion in product revenue. Externally, we will not manage expectations to our previous targets until we have more data. We are focused in executing in FY '24 to ensure long-term durable growth. Now, turning to FY '25 guidance. For the first quarter, we expect product revenue between $745 million and $750 million, representing year-over-year growth between 26% and 27%. For the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP operating margin of 3%, and 366 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full year, we expect product revenue of approximately $3.25 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We expect Snowpark to contribute 3% of product revenue. We are not including any other new products in our forecast at this time. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP product gross margin of 76%, non-GAAP operating margin of 6%, non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 29%, and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 368 million. We plan to add approximately 1,000 employees this year inclusive of M&A. For expenses, our forecast assumes meaningful investments in our AI initiatives. We expect approximately $50 million of GPU-related costs in fiscal year '25, approximately $10 million flowing through cost of product revenue. For the purpose of forecasting, we're not including any incremental revenue associated with these features. We've also evolved our go-to-market motion. As we compensate more reps on a consumption quota, we will see increased commission expense. Consumption-based commissions are expensed immediately rather than amortized over a five-year period. This has no impact on cash flows, but is expected to have approximately $30 million impact to P&L. Lastly, I would like to acknowledge Frank's retirement. Working with Frank for the past 17 years has been an incredible learning experience and I'm grateful for our time together. Frank's contributions to Snowflake has set the company up for long-term success and I look forward to being part of that journey. I have committed to Sridhar and the Board that I will be with Snowflake for at least the next three years. Before closing, we will host our Investor Day on June 4th in San Francisco in conjunction with Data Cloud Summit, our annual users conference. If you're interested in attending, please email ir@snowflake.com. With that operator, you can now open up the line for questions. I think we are definitely being more conservative this year given the consumption patterns we saw in '24. And as we said at our Analyst Day last year, we needed to see consumption patterns more in line with what we saw pre-'24 to get to our longer-term goal. And as a result, we've decided to forecast this year based upon the consumption patterns we saw in '24. And as you know, we forecast based upon historical consumption of our products. There's a lot of new products coming into GA and public preview this year that we have not taken into account in our forecast, and we will do so once we start to see that consumption. And so, we will take this quarter by quarter for the year. Well, as I said, the strength was in financial services. In retail, we are seeing the technology vertical do well. And I wouldn't say it's soft, we did beat the last quarter. But what I would say is, it's improving, but it's not back to the pre-2024 levels as I mentioned, and that's the -- we're basing -- we've revised our model to look at more recent history rather than going back too far in history for forecasting consumption patterns. Well, as we've said before, over time, net revenue retention will converge with our revenue growth rate. And as I've said before, I'm not going to guide to net revenue retention. So, as a reminder, we did AWS and Azure before our Investor Day last year. We just did our Google contract last quarter as well. So, all three of those contracts now, and those are where we are running in those three clouds are current. And I don't expect any changes to those terms in any meaningful way in the short term. It's about a 6.2%, 6.3% impact this year. But coupled with that too in the revenue, we rolled out in Q4 tiered storage pricing. So, the amount of revenue associated with storage is coming down. But on top of that, we do expect a number of our large customers are going to adopt Iceberg formats and move their data out of Snowflake where we lose that storage revenue and also the compute revenue associated with moving that data into Snowflake. We do expect, though, there'll be more workloads that will move to us, but until we see that incremental revenue on workloads, we're not going to forecast that. I will say last year, we saw a 62% increase in the number of jobs running on Snowflake year-over-year with a corresponding 33% increase in revenue. And that's because we continue to show our customers that we become cheaper and cheaper to them every year. And when we do that, it opens up new workload opportunities for us, and we'll continue to do that. Well, I would say, we signed a lot of large multi-year deals in Q4. I mentioned the one that was a five-year $250 million deal. There is -- and so, when customers -- what that really shows is the commitment customers are making to Snowflake. And from a customers' perspective, as long as they use that -- those credits up within their contract period, they're fine. There is a lot of pent-up demand for a lot of our new products that are coming out. Sridhar talked about Document AI. We have a lot of customers that want Cortex and Snowpark Container Services. So, I think it's going to be more back-end loaded this year. And until we see that consumption by our customers, it's hard to forecast that. So, stay tuned. Are you talking from a revenue, or are you talking of bookings? Bookings was very strong in January. I would say from a revenue consumption pattern, I think there was a little bit more of a prolonged holiday that went into mid-January. Coming out of January, consumption is good, but once again and through today, but it's more in line with 2024 consumption versus the pre-'24 consumption patterns. So, the consumption is tracking where we are, and I just gave guidance for the quarter. So, I don't know what else you want me to tell you. What I was talking about was cash flow was the switch in the comp plan from paying people on consumption versus the booking. And it doesn't really change the free cash -- the cash flow associated because we're still doing the payments the same. And it has a $30 million P&L impact, but no cash flow impact is what I was referring to. And obviously, one of the reasons why we switched to paying reps more in consumption is because we want reps to be driving revenue more rather than bookings necessarily. And our reps are heavily compensated on two things this year. You have approximately 35% of our reps are focused just on initial new customers, 55% are just paid on existing customers with driving consumption, identifying new workloads within customers. We have about 10% that are in a hybrid, a mix of new customers and consumption, and those are more in emerging territories or territories where maybe the installed base of customers isn't as high. No. There's a lot of new performance enhancements being rolled out on our software this year that are going to have an impact. There's also -- well, I'll tell you, but I really don't want to because I know you're going to ask a lot of questions. We're also rolling out the Arm chip in the Azure. It's not as big as AWS as an impact that will impact that as well too. And clearly, we do expect customers will begin to adopt Iceberg Table format. I don't know how to answer that question, Kash. But what I would say is I'd like to set the company up to be successful throughout the year as we progress with Sridhar coming on board. For the year. For the year. Anything is possible. What I would say is we did about mid-$30 million in revenue, I think $35 million, $36 million in revenue last year associated with Snowpark. Clearly, what I'm saying 3% is going to be just under $100 million, $95 million or so this year. I think that is pretty phenomenal growth. And if we can get it to grow faster, we obviously will. A lot of big customers want to have open file formats, to give them the options. And by the way, this is not necessarily customers moving all of their storage out of Snowflake, but a lot of the growth in their storage will be put into Iceberg Tables is what we think is going to happen. So, you're just not going to see the growth associated with the storage in many of those customers. As a reminder, about 10% to 11% of our overall revenue is associated with storage. Well, it's built into our guidance. I'm not going to break them out all separately. I would say the performance improvements, which have nothing to do with that, around 6.2%, 6.3%. We're forecasting consumption patterns similar to what we saw in '24. I would say it's more the average of '24, which we saw stability happen in our customer base. I'm not forecasting any type of recovery inside there. Well, I just guided for February, well, for the quarter, and that reflects the consumption trends we've been seeing through yesterday. So, I would say it's more in line with what we saw coming out last year throughout on average for the year. Yeah. Iceberg is not GA yet. So, customers are not going to roll that into production until it's GA, and we do think it will be a gradual process of if they're going to move data out. But as soon as it's GA, new data can go into Iceberg Table. And we don't expect that to be GA until sometime around June timeframe. Correct. It is what we are expecting. I know the tiered -- the new toward -- tiered storage pricing that we rolled out we're seeing that today. And I'll let Christian add some to that as well, too. I would say a lot of our expensive hiring is in the R&D area and it will continue to be more in the AI/ML space. These engineers are very expensive. With that said, we're still adding in the sales organization. And if we see an uptick in new customers and consumption patterns with our customers, we can easily dial that up just like we've dialed back our hiring in the past. But we are not going to sacrifice on R&D. Absolutely no big competitive losses or workloads moving off that I'm aware of. This is all related to our model where a lot of the performance improvements that we have in our software go directly to the customer. And that's why I was pointing out you saw there was a 62% year-over-year growth in jobs on a daily basis run on Snowflake versus only a 33% revenue growth. And we know there's a lot of performance improvements coming into play this year, coupled with Iceberg, coupled with tiered storage pricing that we rolled out. And I was able to roll out the tiered storage pricing because we were getting much better pricing out of the cloud vendors to us. I would say the biggest thing is the uptick in consumption associated with all the new enhancements we have in our product, in particular, what we could see coming out of Cortex, we could see coming out of Snowpark Container Services, and ultimately, what we could see in Native App development on our platform. Well, what I'm saying is we're guiding it to be 3% of product revenue this year, and you can infer what you want from the guidance."

Q3 product revenue grew 34% year-over-year to reach $698 million. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $111 million, representing 7% year-over-year growth. Results reflect strong execution in a broadly stabilizing macro environment. while Snowflake's global revenue mix is highly diverse in terms of industries and geographies, the company derives an ever larger revenue share from mainstream enterprises and institutions. This, as compared to a newer crowd of digital natives, have made up many of Snowflake's early adopters. We added 35 $1 million plus customers during the quarter, 9 of our top 10 customers grew sequentially. Generative AI is at the forefront of customer conversations, which in turn drives renewed emphasis on data strategy in preparation of these new technologies. We said it many times, there's no AI strategy without a data strategy. The intelligence we're all aiming for results in the data, hence the quality of that underpinning is critical. Meanwhile, Snowflake has announced and showcased the plethora of new technologies that let customers mobilize AI. We've introduced Snowflake Cortex to leverage AI and machine learning on Snowflake. Cortex is a managed service for inferencing large language models. This opens up direct access to models and specialized operations by translation, sentiment and vector functions. Business analysts and data engineers can now use AI functionality without the fractured highly technical challenges of the AI landscape. Last summer, we introduced Snowpark Container Services, which also serves as the second pillar of our AI enablement strategy. Developers can access any language, any library and flexible hardware inside the governance boundary of Snowflake. More than 70 customers are already using container services in preview with many more waiting in line. Snowflake makes the common AI use case is easy and the advanced use case is possible. We are well positioned for AI based on the scale and scope of our data cloud programmability and governance framework. There are hurdles challenging enterprise adoption of AI and ML. The first is broad access to quality data. Snowflake addresses this challenge through its data sharing architecture. 28% of all our customer share data, up from 22% a year ago and 73% of our $1 million-plus customers are data sharing up from 67% a year ago. AI models can only be as smart as data they are trained on. Security and governance present another challenge for enterprise adoption of AI and the now Snowflake Horizon offers a unified security and governance solution built for AI. Horizon strictly and consistently enforces user privileges on data across use cases, including large language model applications, traditional ML models and ad hoc queries. As part of Horizon, we introduced universal search, which enables customers to search the data cloud. Customers can now discover data and metadata that exists across their accounts and in the Snowflake marketplace. Snowflake continues to win new workloads outside of its traditional. Snowpark's consumption grew 47% quarter-over-quarter. Consumption in October was up over 500% since last year. Over 30% of customers use Snowflake to process unstructured data in October. Consumption of unstructured data was up 17 times year-over-year. Our newest streaming capability, Dynamic Tables entered public preview earlier this year. Approximately 1,500 customers are using the feature and initial adoption is outpacing expectations. We have a number of major new capabilities becoming broadly available in Q4. Our native apps framework will go GA, UniStore for transaction processing, Snowpark Container Services and Apache Iceberg Tables will all enter public preview. These products unlock substantial new workload expansion opportunities. We are campaigning globally to expand our audience. This fall, our Data Cloud World Tour traveled to 26 cities worldwide. In-person attendance at these events reached 23,000 nearly double from last year. Next up is our Build Developer Conference in early December, where we anticipate 35,000 registrations. Build is focused on building apps, data pipelines and AI/ML workflows. We hope to see you there. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. In Q3, we saw strong consumption from a broad base of customers. Our performance was evenly split between large and small accounts largest customer stabilized as expected. Migrations drove growth in Q3. Our two fastest-growing customers who are both migrating workloads from a legacy vendor. One of these accounts is in their second year on the platform, the other in their eighth year on the platform. We added four customers with more than $5 million and two customers with more than $10 million in trailing 12-month product revenue in the quarter. Growth in September exceeded expectations. For three weeks, consumption grew faster than any other period in the past two years. Consumption continued to grow in the month of October. Q3 represented a strong quarter for bookings execution. Remaining performance obligations grew 23% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. Of the $3.7 billion in RPO, we expect 57% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. APJ and SMB drove growth in net new bookings. We are making significant progress in delivering margin expansion. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 78% was up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Improved terms from the cloud service providers have contributed to margin expansion. We also benefit from increasing consumption of higher-priced additions of Snowflake. In Q3, price per credit increased 4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 10% was ahead of expectations. Operating margin benefited from revenue outperformance and increased hiring scrutiny. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 15%, benefiting from favorable timing of collections. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Our strong cash position allows us to opportunistically repurchase shares. In Q3, we used $400 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares. Year-to-date, we have used $592 million to repurchase 4 million shares at an average price of $147.5. Now let's turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect product revenue between $716 million and $721 million, representing year-over-year growth between 29% and 30%. We're increasing our full-year guidance to approximately $2.65 billion, representing 37% year-over-year growth. Consumption trends have improved. We are seeing stability in customer expansion patterns. Our guidance is based on observed patterns and assumes continued stability of consumption. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating margin of 4% and 360 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full-year, we are increasing our non-GAAP product gross margin guidance. We now expect non-GAAP gross margin of 77%. We still expect a product gross margin headwind in the fourth quarter associated with new products. We are increasing our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP operating margin guidance. We now expect non-GAAP operating margin of 7%. We are increasing our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin. We now expect non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 27%. For the full-year, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 361 million. We are on track to add more than 1,000 employees this year, inclusive of M&A. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Murphy: Thank you so much. I love the 11-minute earnings call, and congrats on a fantastic result. So Frank, we are hearing broadly that conversations are starting with generative AI and they're stopping at data, because they find their data estates aren't in good enough shape. Are you sensing more tangible uplift there around that concept that Snowflake might be on the front edge of AI projects and perhaps seeing that spill over into customer conversations or drive more pipeline for some of your other products like Snowpipes and Snowpark and data sharing?\nFrank Slootman: Generally speaking, yes, one of the interesting things is that customers are now getting preoccupied with their data estates because they have to get them into shape where they can productively take advantage of the newer technologies, which we are now also showcasing and delivering where they can just turn it on and have well-governed frameworks to run them with all the things that they're used to from Snowflake. So it's definitely true that the frenzy and the high degree of interest in AI has a knock-on effect on the interest in data strategy, data platforms. And people are also not just looking at the quality of their data and the optimization of the organization curation of data but also what kind of data they need to be able to have access to. So people are taking a much broader view of their data estates as well in terms of what's in it and what should be in it.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Murphy. Our next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you guys. [Indiscernible] on for Keith. Maybe just start off with a quick question on sort of you mentioned several times on the call, the stabilization that you are seeing in your -- with the new growth. And we've obviously heard that from sort of your hyperscaler peers as well. When you're looking at an account level, could you give us sort of an idea like how much of the stabilization is coming from cost optimization, scrutiny alleviating versus sort of existing customers who slow what migrations leaning in more versus customers leaning more into new products? Is there any way that you can kind of give us more color, what parts are playing out already and which are yet to come maybe into the next year?\nFrank Slootman: Keith, one of the things, it is Frank. What I mentioned is our customer base has evolved in recent years to include much larger enterprises and institutions who are typically not prone to over consumption and unbridled expansion that they then later have to reset and rationalize. Because of that, the exposure to these drastic resets and optimization that we saw earlier in the year is getting less and less with each incremental quarter. Secondly, people have really driven themselves through these processes and rationalized themselves and are now in a good place to move forward. You can only optimize and rationalize so much. At some point, it's diminishing returns. People get tired of us and they're moving on to things that are now new and interesting, namely preparing for enabling AI and ML technologies.\nMike Scarpelli: I'll add to that, too, that why we see that stabilization is nine out of our top 10 customers all grew quarterly sequentially. And the other point I'll make is we are seeing a shift, as Frank mentioned. Our biggest customers are mature enterprises we're seeing now and mature enterprises have always scrutinized cost. They always will. And so there's nothing new there, and that will continue. And that's just the way anyone should run a business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe one quick question on your sales and marketing headcount. Obviously, we noticed it's basically flat quarter-over-quarter this quarter. But then again, it's only sort of one number. Can you shed some light in terms of like what regions are you may be leaning more into versus getting more efficiencies or any sort of areas that you're investing in still? Because obviously, your growth seems pretty healthy. So just some color on where you're investing, would be helpful.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. So first of all, in general, with sales and marketing heads, most of those typically are added right at the end of Q4 or even more so at the beginning of Q1, so people can get involved in our sales kickoff. And what I would say is we are continuing to invest very heavily in our sales and marketing function, in particular, in Europe. We talked about six months ago or so, we added a new leader there. We have been changing out some people and investing, and we're continuing to, and we will continue to prune underperformers globally and invest more in the right people as we go forward. And APJ is another one that we continue to invest in.\nUnidentified Analyst: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Weiss. Our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. You may proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. Guys, you have like a crazy amount of new exciting products coming out. How do you think about the sales setup here now going forward? Because you're going to be able to address lots of different areas from like classic data to kind of more AI. Does that mean your sales approach needs to change, Frank, here going forward? And it doesn't sound like you are going to have a crazy sales force expansion here. Like how do you want to do that going forward and ensure that all these new products are actually finding the market? Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: Yes that's actually an excellent observation. We have historically had sort of one dominant selling motion that we sort of deployed everywhere and anywhere. It has served us well. But as you correctly observed, the market has really changed. When you go back to 2015, Snowflake really swam in swim lanes that were very narrowly defined and very well understood. Now we're in the mega market, right? These are very, very broad-based platforms that are incredibly capable in many directions. And we've been working very hard, as you've seen in recent years, in delivering just an absolute ton of capabilities to enable these platforms in all these different directions. I mean, our drive towards applications and the whole programmability framework, the onslaught of AI and AM and our capabilities, all of that is coming to fruition. Now we have a ton of irons in the fire, and they're now all getting hot. So from a sales standpoint, we have much more specialization happening and that is going to literally going all over the world because it is impossible for a single person to be to be expert in all these technologies and all these disciplines. So we're going to have people that have general purpose capabilities, sort of core skills, if you will, and then we will have teams of specialists that will augment these groups wherever they're needed. So our basic selling motions and how they are supported will evolve rapidly in the coming year.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Lenschow. Our next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. Congrats on the quarter. I guess, Mike, could you just talk about the impact that some of these newer unstructured data workloads are having on consumption at all, meaning I assume it's still a very, very small part of overall consumption when you look at it, but is that helping with the stabilization? Can they turn into sort of catalyst for acceleration as we get into '24? Anything you to sort of dimensionalize the impact that has as we think out to next year? Thanks.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, they're definitely helping with stabilization. I can't quantify exactly what unstructured is doing, but it's not just that. It's also we're starting to see the effects more of Snowpark that's doing very well for us right now. Some of the new things we're already seeing very early uptick in streaming and dynamic tables. We really, I would say, Streamlit is built into our forecast for next year. The other products because they're new, we really don't build much in for that because we need history before we can do that. And clearly, we think a lot of these new products that are just going into public preview now and GA next year will be a catalyst for growth for us in 2025.\nFrank Slootman: One follow-on, Kirk. Document AI is a technology that we've been working on for quite a while, and it really was on the basis of an acquisition we did over a year ago. That is now going into preview. And it is incredibly popular out there and what Document AI does returns to an unstructured document into a semi-structure document. So it can become a full participant in analytical processing. There is a ton of interest in that. And so that really brings the entire estate of unstructured data, which is 80% of the world's data into the analytical sphere. So we do expect that to become very important, and especially because AI and LLMs are so heavily focused on unstructured data, textual data, at least today, this will be something that will be a driver in our business.\nKirk Materne: Thanks. And Mike, can you just give us an update on where the federal sort of opportunity stands? I know you guys were waiting to hear back on FedRAMP. Any update on that? Thanks.\nMike Scarpelli: Federal is a huge opportunity, and I would say it's upside for us because it's such a small piece, but we should have our FedRAMP high authorization literally any day. I actually thought I might have had it today. So stay tuned. You'll see an announcement on that very soon.\nKirk Materne: Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Materne. Our next question is from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. You may proceed.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks very much. Just a quick technical question with Graviton 4 now being announced by Amazon, should we think of any potential headwinds there?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, as we told you before, every year, we count on a 5% headwind associated with software hardware improvements. Graviton 4 was just announced recently. We really have not tested that and not all hardware improvements benefit our software. We expect there will be some, but we just don't know. It's too early, stay tuned and we'll update you when we have more information.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Reback. Our next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nEthan Bruck: Hey, guys. This is Ethan Bruck for Alex Zukin. Congrats on the nice quarter. My question is, if you're assuming the consumption trends persist through 4Q, and that's how you're guiding, I guess, what would be the biggest puts and takes to accelerate growth next year? And in the same vein, when we think about NRR, just given the stabilizing consumption trends, I guess, directionally, when should we think about when would we expect NRR to stabilize trough and around like what level would you expect?\nMike Scarpelli: So I'll start with -- I'm not going to guide to NRR. I do see it stabilizing. It could dip a little bit more. I do expect over time, NRR, as we've said, we'll converge with our revenue growth. at the size we're at. And clearly, the biggest puts and takes for next year is going to be the -- to continue to see the stabilization we have we're seeing right now and what the impact of a lot of our new initiatives are going to be next year, and it's just too early to tell right now and to guide to that. So stay tuned for our February call when we give guidance for next year.\nEthan Bruck: Great. Thank you very much, Scarpelli.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Zukin. Our next question is from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, Mike. I think you mentioned there is a higher utilization on the higher tiers that you're offering. Can you just extrapolate what you're seeing there?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, typically, large enterprises are the ones using our business critical in BPS, and those guys are becoming bigger and bigger customers. And as a result, we do see more of our revenue being derived from these very large companies who are using our higher SKU, which has higher margin for us, and that's what we're seeing there.\nBrent Thill: Okay. And quickly for Frank, when you think about just the overall AI impact, do you feel that this is a bigger tailwind in the back half of '24? Do you think you'll see it coming in early '24? How are your thought process in terms of adoption in this way, helping you? When does that impact hit from a monetization perspective?\nFrank Slootman: There's going to be a lot of nuances to how AI is going to unfold and translate itself into the effects into our business. It's not just like turning on the switch and all of a sudden, you see incremental consumption happening. As we said during the prepared remarks, we're already seeing that the interest in AI is also driving interest in the data strategy, which then has a knock-on effect on consumption. It's also the expansion of the data universe that people are bringing in quality of the data initiatives. All of that is going to bring incremental workload utilization to Snowflake, even though you would normally not necessarily characterize that as AI, but these are things that are going to enable AI, and it might well be that a ton of the workload of AI is actually the proverbial iceberg where only the tip of it that's ticking above the water is really AI, but everything that has to happen to support us is happening below the service then we're going to be a huge beneficiary of that. We think that Snowflake is super well prepared because our data estates are in a very, very advanced state because our customers have spent years, years and years. And in some cases, literally decades from prior legacy platforms to building these estates and curing the data and organizing and optimizing for the data to be completely trusted and sanctioned in their environment, and that is a huge value when you start tackling AI and ML models.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Thill. Our next question is from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. You may proceed.\nPatrick Colville: All right, thank you so much for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you talked of very strong consumption in September. Consumption continued to grow in October. We're now 29 days through November. Can you just talk about trends thus far this month?\nMike Scarpelli: What I would say is trends are good, but you have to remember, it also has a big holiday in the U.S. and the week of Thanksgiving is typically a slow week. With that said, I'm happy with the consumption we're seeing, and that's reflected in our guidance.\nPatrick Colville: Perfect, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Colville Our next question is from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. You may proceed.\nTyler Radke: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about container services. So it sounds like you're seeing some good early momentum there, more than 70 customers in private preview. I'm curious how many of those are actually deploying large language models directly on the Snowflake data? And for those customers that are doing that, what type of uplift or how you kind of characterize that consumption when they do that?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. This is Christian. Yes, we have seen a variety of use cases, but a good number of those prior preview customers are leveraging GPU instances in silver and payer services for use of large language models. So for sure, it's a meaningful part of the early adoption use cases and we've got lots of encouragement and excitement to continue the rollout of the preview.\nTyler Radke: Great. And just a question on go-to-market. So I think earlier this year, you talked about some execution issues and it seems like that's been partially resolved to get good results in APAC. I guess, do you feel like you have all the right key sales leaders in place at this point? Or are there still some roles you're looking for? And I guess, ultimately, do you feel like you've turned the corner on those execution issues as well?\nFrank Slootman: Yes. It's Frank. Look, in a global sales organization that we're running and we're running all the way from an on-demand selling motion that's unattended, if you will, by salespeople to SMB, to an ISB to mid-range large and then the extremely large customers. The -- it's always a work in process. There's always opportunity for improvement. That's been true for as long as I've been here. That said, I feel we're getting incrementally better, stronger, deeper in terms of our ability to sell. We're becoming much more consistent and more and more productive every day. So a lot of stability and a lot of progress. But this is something that's never over. Anybody who's been in this business knows how this works. It's a very dynamic mix of things. But on the whole, we have to, as a company, a $3 billion or something of that order of magnitude run rate, we lean hard on our organization to show up and deliver those results every quarter. So it's becoming a formidable enterprise in terms of our go-to-market capability.\nTyler Radke: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Radke. Our next question is from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you and good afternoon. Frank, we'll start with you here. I think last quarter, unstructured data was mentioned twice. You've called it out here more than a dozen times. You talked about October trends being up, I think, 17x increase year-over-year. How much of a game changer is this, particularly as we think about Document AI and Snowpark Containers coming out next year? Clearly, a focus here. It certainly hasn't been an area you supported in the past, but it feels like there's a sea change movement here. How much of a game changer is unstructured data support relative to the growth opportunity going forward?\nFrank Slootman: Look, unstructured data, as I said earlier, is the majority of the world's data. And until relatively recently, it's been borderline unusable for analytical purposes, because it is unstructured and you can't reference it in analytical workloads. It's ironic that both through the on slide of large language models that is also extraordinarily of dealing with textual data as well as things just Document AI that Snowflake developed, and it's bringing to the market that this data is going to become a full participant in these types of workloads. It's super exciting. It's going to really enriched and really unlock insights and outcomes and all of that we haven't had before. So this is going to be a driver of our world as we know it in terms of this type of computing.\nBrent Bracelin: That's helpful. And Mike, if I look at average consumption revenue per customer, those metrics improved on a growth perspective, slightly year-over-year for the first time in over a year. What are the driving factors there? How much of this is just the optimization headwinds now starting to ease versus net new workloads coming on the platform?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, what I would say, and I'll repeat what I've said at numerous times to investors, optimizations are part of our life. They've been happening at Snowflake from day 1, they will continue to happen. Nothing is new with optimization. I don't see any big ones happening now, but that's not to say they won't happen in the future, because history has shown they happen all the time. Most of the growth that we're seeing within our customers is we talked about two of our biggest growth customers was on-prem legacy migrations into Snowflake. So there's initial migrations, but we're also seeing new workload expansion within existing customers as well, too. So it's -- there's no one thing that's driving it. It's just general consumption we're seeing. And I will say Snowpark is starting to kick in for us. Still not 10% of our revenue. That's a long ways to get there, but it's still meaningful for us.\nBrent Bracelin: Great to hear, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Bracelin. Our next question is from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks. I guess I wanted to dovetail off of that on-premise legacy migrations. And I guess for Frank, I mean, when we saw the macro hit, I think it did cause a slowdown in customers looking to re-platform from on-prem to cloud. Just curious, I mean, I know you guys are kind of highlighting the consumption trends improving here. But wondering what you're seeing in the pipeline for new Global 2000 accounts? And if you're seeing legacy replatforming initiatives start to kick back up now that the macro environment has gotten a little bit more stable?\nFrank Slootman: Well, I mean, there's no doubt that the legacy replatforming is sort of the hardcore of our business. And almost surprisingly there is just an enormous amount of workloads still sitting on-premise that is still waiting to get migrated to the cloud. So I expect this to continue for a very long period of time. But as what Mike's said is very important. Once you get those data states into the cloud, our new architectures and our new technologies are now enabling opportunities that people haven't had before. And so that drives workload expansion. So it's not just like, okay, we're going to be doing in the cloud where we used to be doing on-premise, and that's the foundation of the business. It is definitely foundational but the opportunity is really what grows from that. That's been the Snowflake story from day one because of what's now possible. We don't have the capacity constraints and people can run unlimited numbers of workloads. And now with all the new technologies in terms of programmability, AI and sky is the limit. I mean, in our conversation with customers, I was telling us is that your problem is no longer the technology. Your problem is your imagination and your budget, right? Not that those are easy things, but technology is not holding us back anymore. It's our ability to harness the technology. And then, of course, you have to pay for it as well.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. I'll just add to that, Derrick, too, on your question about Global 2000. Yes, we added two Global 2000 last quarter. And as I've said many times before, selling into a Global 2000 as a campaign, it's a one to two, sometimes three year sales cycle. With that said, we have a number of Global 2000 in our pipeline for Q4. And what I also want to see, too, is not every Global 2000 starts with an on-prem migration. Many of them start with a first-gen cloud solution they had purchased to migrate to Snowflake. Yes, almost all of them have an on-prem estate, but that doesn't always happen at first. It really varies by customer. But with that said, we still see a lot of on-prem migration to be done over the coming years, and it's going to be for many, many years.\nDerrick Wood: Got it. And Mike, a follow-on for you, really around RPO. And we've heard of more companies looking to take a pay-as-you-go approach. So could you speak to what extent customers are shifting to that approach versus annual or multiyear commits and how that may play into your RPO growth trends looking forward?\nMike Scarpelli: No. I don't see that, that much. The only time you see pay-as-you-go are ones who had signed a 3-year contract and then they run out of capacity. And then they just pay as they go. Actually, one of our top 10 customers is like that. They have until April to continue before they have to do another contract, if they want to get the same pricing that they have. I actually expect Q4 is going to be a pretty significant bookings quarter with a number of renewals that are up or customers are going to do something. And we continue to push for three-year contracts with our customers. Payment terms, I do expect though that is one of the things I'd rather give up on payment terms and discount to price per credit. And that's really, I've said it all along, I anticipate longer term, customers will want to do more monthly in arrears payment terms, and that is available to customers. It all comes down to what price you want to pay per credit. And to date, most people want the lower price per credit and are willing to pay annually in advance.\nDerrick Wood: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Wood. Our next question is from the line of Joel Fishbein with Truist. You may proceed.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks for my question and congrats on the great quarter. I guess, Frank, this one is for you. Snowflake Summit, you announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft. And I'm just curious how that partnership is going, and you also announced some joint product integration. So I'd love to get an update how that's going and how you feel about that going forward?\nFrank Slootman: This is Frank. Yes, we actually saw quite a bit of energy coming from the Azure platform this quarter. The things that we worked on in the renewed relationship with Microsoft is really much better alignment in the field from a compensation standpoint that is just super, super important in our world. And we're seeing the effects of that. And the Microsoft platform really upticked during the quarter. I don't know the exact numbers at hand, but it measurably ticked up. So we're encouraged by the behavior we're seeing in the field, and we're encouraged in the overall sentiment that's developing in the field. So it's definitely healthier than the relationship with Microsoft has been historically. So we're pleased and optimistic about it.\nJoel Fishbein: Any milestones we should be looking for there from the partnership?\nFrank Slootman: Not really. We'll let you know.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fishbein. Our next question is from the line of Mike Cikos -- with Mike Cikos. Please proceed.\nMike Cikos: Thank you for getting me on here. And good to hear some of the earlier comments around Snowpark, which is consistent with some of the growing momentum we've heard in some of our checks. I think the question is probably more for maybe Mike or Christian. But is there enough empirical data or a sizable enough customer base yet for Snowpark to start talking about how these Snowpark customers, I guess, what adoption of Snowpark does for consumption versus non-Snowpark customers? Or maybe how we should think about usage building over time as Snowpark becomes a larger part of those customers' workflows?\nMike Scarpelli: I think it's still too early to tell. I will say -- we have one customer doing a significant migration, which will increase their consumption on Snowflake to roughly $1.5 million a year. And there are a number of those that we've identified in POCs, but we haven't done the migrations. I see that 1 customer going into production right now, which, by the way, has saved them significantly on their legacy vendor. So clearly, the -- with some customers, it's quite meaningful, the consumption we're starting to see, and we expect that trend will continue into next year.\nMike Cikos: Understood. Thanks for calling that out, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Sikos. Our next question is from Patrick Walravens with JMP. You may proceed.\nOwen Hobbs: Hi, this is Owen Hobbs on for Pat. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the strong quarter. So starting off, I guess, how much consumption comes from the different hyperscalers? Is there 1 that kind of is it split evenly between the three or does kind of have the majority of compute share there?\nMike Scarpelli: No. AWS by far is our biggest, followed by Azure and then GCP. GCP is up to 3% right now. Microsoft Azure is the fastest-growing one, but AWS is still 76% of our business with Microsoft being 21%. As I said, GCP is 3%. And I will tell you, 1 of the reasons why GCP is not as big as just so much more expensive for our customers to operate in GCP than it is in AWS and Azure. And as a result, our salespeople are really not inclined to do much in GCP.\nOwen Hobbs: Thank you. And then going bigger picture, maybe this is a question for Christian as well. How is the role of the data scientist you sort of kind of changed as we move through the era of big data, machine learning and now into AI? And I guess where do you see that going in the future?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. We see actual interest on both the traditional data science and ML platform. And we've had a number of announcements at Snowflake for those such use cases, but we obviously see lots of interest on generative AI and large language models where we have also expanded obviously capability to do both hosting via Snowpark Container Services, but more seamless inferencing via the new Snowflake Cortex. So we see strong demand from our broad customer base for both types of use cases.\nOwen Hobbs: Good. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Walravens. Our next question is from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. You may proceed.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. Thank you very much. Frank, since you speak with a lot of large company execs, I'm curious to hear any thoughts you have on IT budgets next year as well as whether there will be incremental budget dollars approved for AI in calendar '24 or if the AI spend will primarily or maybe even entirely come from other areas of IT?\nFrank Slootman: I don't even hear the words AI and budget in the same sentence. In other words, they're going to make resources available to enable it. But if anything is holding them back is really understanding how to do it. It takes time in tech to mature and evolve deployment architectures where everybody involved is fully confident and comfortable that these are the right ways to do it. So you see a lot of benchmark and compare and contrast experimentation, testing all these kinds of things. And they're going to go through many, many iterations of that. We will as well. And I think that the field will become very proliferated with large foundational models and many, many, many subsector specialized models that are very, very, very deep, but also are very, very narrow in purpose. So it is going to become an enormous field. I will tell you that when you talk to the C-suite in large enterprises, people are looking for a reset of economics, like, for example, in contact centers, pricing optimization, supply chain management, I mean, really very, very big impact opportunities. These are not sort of marginal incremental and that has the attention. Data has always had a promise, but it's really on steroids now under the influence of the newer technologies that we're all excited about.\nGregg Moskowitz: Very helpful. And then for Mike, really encouraging, of course, to hear that for three weeks, consumption grew faster than any other period over the past two years. Over which three weeks though, did you see that particularly strong consumption? Was that post Labor Day? Or did it span a different time period?\nMike Scarpelli: Post Labor Day.\nGregg Moskowitz: Right, Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Moskowitz. Our last question is from the line of Will Power with Baird. You may proceed.\nWill Power: Okay, great. Thanks. Mike, you referenced that nine of your top 10 customers, it sounds like we're nicely quarter-over-quarter. I guess I wonder, were there any common use cases or products or common threads kind of driving that? Any other color behind the strength there?\nMike Scarpelli: No, these are just all very large customers with massive data estates that continue to -- one was doing a big migration, but the others are just continuing to move workloads to Snowflake.\nFrank Slootman: That's very industry-specific as well.\nWill Power: Okay. And maybe just a quick question on product gross margins. Last couple of quarters, you're kind of already at your longer-term target, I think. It sounds like there may be a couple of headwinds there in Q4, but is this kind of the general level to expect going forward? And maybe any color on kind of the upside surprise, I guess, if you will, given it seems like you've gotten there faster than you might have expected?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. I don't really see a lot of upside in our long-term guidance and for a number of reasons. The big headwind that we're seeing this quarter to our margin is with all these new products, that are going into public preview. We have to start to amortize the costs associated with the software development costs that we're required to capitalize under GAAP that are now going to start to be amortized on top of that. In particular, something like Unistar, a lot of times when we introduce new products, many times, we actually have negative contribution margins until it takes us usually up to half a year to nine months to actually fine-tune the software to get the -- to take costs out of operating those new features. And so we just have so many new products that are coming out this quarter that is going to have a headwind on the margin.\nWill Power: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Power. That concludes the question-and-answer session as well as today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks, Jimmy. Welcome and good afternoon. Q3 product revenue grew 34% year-over-year to reach $698 million. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $111 million, representing 7% year-over-year growth. Results reflect strong execution in a broadly stabilizing macro environment. while Snowflake's global revenue mix is highly diverse in terms of industries and geographies, the company derives an ever larger revenue share from mainstream enterprises and institutions. This, as compared to a newer crowd of digital natives, have made up many of Snowflake's early adopters. We added 35 $1 million plus customers during the quarter, 9 of our top 10 customers grew sequentially. Generative AI is at the forefront of customer conversations, which in turn drives renewed emphasis on data strategy in preparation of these new technologies. We said it many times, there's no AI strategy without a data strategy. The intelligence we're all aiming for results in the data, hence the quality of that underpinning is critical. Meanwhile, Snowflake has announced and showcased the plethora of new technologies that let customers mobilize AI. We've introduced Snowflake Cortex to leverage AI and machine learning on Snowflake. Cortex is a managed service for inferencing large language models. This opens up direct access to models and specialized operations by translation, sentiment and vector functions. Business analysts and data engineers can now use AI functionality without the fractured highly technical challenges of the AI landscape. Last summer, we introduced Snowpark Container Services, which also serves as the second pillar of our AI enablement strategy. Developers can access any language, any library and flexible hardware inside the governance boundary of Snowflake. More than 70 customers are already using container services in preview with many more waiting in line. Snowflake makes the common AI use case is easy and the advanced use case is possible. We are well positioned for AI based on the scale and scope of our data cloud programmability and governance framework. There are hurdles challenging enterprise adoption of AI and ML. The first is broad access to quality data. Snowflake addresses this challenge through its data sharing architecture. 28% of all our customer share data, up from 22% a year ago and 73% of our $1 million-plus customers are data sharing up from 67% a year ago. AI models can only be as smart as data they are trained on. Security and governance present another challenge for enterprise adoption of AI and the now Snowflake Horizon offers a unified security and governance solution built for AI. Horizon strictly and consistently enforces user privileges on data across use cases, including large language model applications, traditional ML models and ad hoc queries. As part of Horizon, we introduced universal search, which enables customers to search the data cloud. Customers can now discover data and metadata that exists across their accounts and in the Snowflake marketplace. Snowflake continues to win new workloads outside of its traditional. Snowpark's consumption grew 47% quarter-over-quarter. Consumption in October was up over 500% since last year. Over 30% of customers use Snowflake to process unstructured data in October. Consumption of unstructured data was up 17 times year-over-year. Our newest streaming capability, Dynamic Tables entered public preview earlier this year. Approximately 1,500 customers are using the feature and initial adoption is outpacing expectations. We have a number of major new capabilities becoming broadly available in Q4. Our native apps framework will go GA, UniStore for transaction processing, Snowpark Container Services and Apache Iceberg Tables will all enter public preview. These products unlock substantial new workload expansion opportunities. We are campaigning globally to expand our audience. This fall, our Data Cloud World Tour traveled to 26 cities worldwide. In-person attendance at these events reached 23,000 nearly double from last year. Next up is our Build Developer Conference in early December, where we anticipate 35,000 registrations. Build is focused on building apps, data pipelines and AI/ML workflows. We hope to see you there. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Generally speaking, yes, one of the interesting things is that customers are now getting preoccupied with their data estates because they have to get them into shape where they can productively take advantage of the newer technologies, which we are now also showcasing and delivering where they can just turn it on and have well-governed frameworks to run them with all the things that they're used to from Snowflake. So it's definitely true that the frenzy and the high degree of interest in AI has a knock-on effect on the interest in data strategy, data platforms. And people are also not just looking at the quality of their data and the optimization of the organization curation of data but also what kind of data they need to be able to have access to. So people are taking a much broader view of their data estates as well in terms of what's in it and what should be in it. Keith, one of the things, it is Frank. What I mentioned is our customer base has evolved in recent years to include much larger enterprises and institutions who are typically not prone to over consumption and unbridled expansion that they then later have to reset and rationalize. Because of that, the exposure to these drastic resets and optimization that we saw earlier in the year is getting less and less with each incremental quarter. Secondly, people have really driven themselves through these processes and rationalized themselves and are now in a good place to move forward. You can only optimize and rationalize so much. At some point, it's diminishing returns. People get tired of us and they're moving on to things that are now new and interesting, namely preparing for enabling AI and ML technologies. Yes that's actually an excellent observation. We have historically had sort of one dominant selling motion that we sort of deployed everywhere and anywhere. It has served us well. But as you correctly observed, the market has really changed. When you go back to 2015, Snowflake really swam in swim lanes that were very narrowly defined and very well understood. Now we're in the mega market, right? These are very, very broad-based platforms that are incredibly capable in many directions. And we've been working very hard, as you've seen in recent years, in delivering just an absolute ton of capabilities to enable these platforms in all these different directions. I mean, our drive towards applications and the whole programmability framework, the onslaught of AI and AM and our capabilities, all of that is coming to fruition. Now we have a ton of irons in the fire, and they're now all getting hot. So from a sales standpoint, we have much more specialization happening and that is going to literally going all over the world because it is impossible for a single person to be to be expert in all these technologies and all these disciplines. So we're going to have people that have general purpose capabilities, sort of core skills, if you will, and then we will have teams of specialists that will augment these groups wherever they're needed. So our basic selling motions and how they are supported will evolve rapidly in the coming year. One follow-on, Kirk. Document AI is a technology that we've been working on for quite a while, and it really was on the basis of an acquisition we did over a year ago. That is now going into preview. And it is incredibly popular out there and what Document AI does returns to an unstructured document into a semi-structure document. So it can become a full participant in analytical processing. There is a ton of interest in that. And so that really brings the entire estate of unstructured data, which is 80% of the world's data into the analytical sphere. So we do expect that to become very important, and especially because AI and LLMs are so heavily focused on unstructured data, textual data, at least today, this will be something that will be a driver in our business. There's going to be a lot of nuances to how AI is going to unfold and translate itself into the effects into our business. It's not just like turning on the switch and all of a sudden, you see incremental consumption happening. As we said during the prepared remarks, we're already seeing that the interest in AI is also driving interest in the data strategy, which then has a knock-on effect on consumption. It's also the expansion of the data universe that people are bringing in quality of the data initiatives. All of that is going to bring incremental workload utilization to Snowflake, even though you would normally not necessarily characterize that as AI, but these are things that are going to enable AI, and it might well be that a ton of the workload of AI is actually the proverbial iceberg where only the tip of it that's ticking above the water is really AI, but everything that has to happen to support us is happening below the service then we're going to be a huge beneficiary of that. We think that Snowflake is super well prepared because our data estates are in a very, very advanced state because our customers have spent years, years and years. And in some cases, literally decades from prior legacy platforms to building these estates and curing the data and organizing and optimizing for the data to be completely trusted and sanctioned in their environment, and that is a huge value when you start tackling AI and ML models. Yes. It's Frank. Look, in a global sales organization that we're running and we're running all the way from an on-demand selling motion that's unattended, if you will, by salespeople to SMB, to an ISB to mid-range large and then the extremely large customers. The -- it's always a work in process. There's always opportunity for improvement. That's been true for as long as I've been here. That said, I feel we're getting incrementally better, stronger, deeper in terms of our ability to sell. We're becoming much more consistent and more and more productive every day. So a lot of stability and a lot of progress. But this is something that's never over. Anybody who's been in this business knows how this works. It's a very dynamic mix of things. But on the whole, we have to, as a company, a $3 billion or something of that order of magnitude run rate, we lean hard on our organization to show up and deliver those results every quarter. So it's becoming a formidable enterprise in terms of our go-to-market capability. Look, unstructured data, as I said earlier, is the majority of the world's data. And until relatively recently, it's been borderline unusable for analytical purposes, because it is unstructured and you can't reference it in analytical workloads. It's ironic that both through the on slide of large language models that is also extraordinarily of dealing with textual data as well as things just Document AI that Snowflake developed, and it's bringing to the market that this data is going to become a full participant in these types of workloads. It's super exciting. It's going to really enriched and really unlock insights and outcomes and all of that we haven't had before. So this is going to be a driver of our world as we know it in terms of this type of computing. Well, I mean, there's no doubt that the legacy replatforming is sort of the hardcore of our business. And almost surprisingly there is just an enormous amount of workloads still sitting on-premise that is still waiting to get migrated to the cloud. So I expect this to continue for a very long period of time. But as what Mike's said is very important. Once you get those data states into the cloud, our new architectures and our new technologies are now enabling opportunities that people haven't had before. And so that drives workload expansion. So it's not just like, okay, we're going to be doing in the cloud where we used to be doing on-premise, and that's the foundation of the business. It is definitely foundational but the opportunity is really what grows from that. That's been the Snowflake story from day one because of what's now possible. We don't have the capacity constraints and people can run unlimited numbers of workloads. And now with all the new technologies in terms of programmability, AI and sky is the limit. I mean, in our conversation with customers, I was telling us is that your problem is no longer the technology. Your problem is your imagination and your budget, right? Not that those are easy things, but technology is not holding us back anymore. It's our ability to harness the technology. And then, of course, you have to pay for it as well. This is Frank. Yes, we actually saw quite a bit of energy coming from the Azure platform this quarter. The things that we worked on in the renewed relationship with Microsoft is really much better alignment in the field from a compensation standpoint that is just super, super important in our world. And we're seeing the effects of that. And the Microsoft platform really upticked during the quarter. I don't know the exact numbers at hand, but it measurably ticked up. So we're encouraged by the behavior we're seeing in the field, and we're encouraged in the overall sentiment that's developing in the field. So it's definitely healthier than the relationship with Microsoft has been historically. So we're pleased and optimistic about it. Not really. We'll let you know. I don't even hear the words AI and budget in the same sentence. In other words, they're going to make resources available to enable it. But if anything is holding them back is really understanding how to do it. It takes time in tech to mature and evolve deployment architectures where everybody involved is fully confident and comfortable that these are the right ways to do it. So you see a lot of benchmark and compare and contrast experimentation, testing all these kinds of things. And they're going to go through many, many iterations of that. We will as well. And I think that the field will become very proliferated with large foundational models and many, many, many subsector specialized models that are very, very, very deep, but also are very, very narrow in purpose. So it is going to become an enormous field. I will tell you that when you talk to the C-suite in large enterprises, people are looking for a reset of economics, like, for example, in contact centers, pricing optimization, supply chain management, I mean, really very, very big impact opportunities. These are not sort of marginal incremental and that has the attention.

            "name": "Mike Scarpelli",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. In Q3, we saw strong consumption from a broad base of customers. Our performance was evenly split between large and small accounts largest customer stabilized as expected. Migrations drove growth in Q3. Our two fastest-growing customers who are both migrating workloads from a legacy vendor. One of these accounts is in their second year on the platform, the other in their eighth year on the platform. We added four customers with more than $5 million and two customers with more than $10 million in trailing 12-month product revenue in the quarter. Growth in September exceeded expectations. For three weeks, consumption grew faster than any other period in the past two years. Consumption continued to grow in the month of October. Q3 represented a strong quarter for bookings execution. Remaining performance obligations grew 23% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. Of the $3.7 billion in RPO, we expect 57% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. APJ and SMB drove growth in net new bookings. We are making significant progress in delivering margin expansion. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 78% was up approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. Improved terms from the cloud service providers have contributed to margin expansion. We also benefit from increasing consumption of higher-priced additions of Snowflake. In Q3, price per credit increased 4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 10% was ahead of expectations. Operating margin benefited from revenue outperformance and increased hiring scrutiny. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 15%, benefiting from favorable timing of collections. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Our strong cash position allows us to opportunistically repurchase shares. In Q3, we used $400 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares. Year-to-date, we have used $592 million to repurchase 4 million shares at an average price of $147.5. Now let's turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect product revenue between $716 million and $721 million, representing year-over-year growth between 29% and 30%. We're increasing our full-year guidance to approximately $2.65 billion, representing 37% year-over-year growth. Consumption trends have improved. We are seeing stability in customer expansion patterns. Our guidance is based on observed patterns and assumes continued stability of consumption. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating margin of 4% and 360 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full-year, we are increasing our non-GAAP product gross margin guidance. We now expect non-GAAP gross margin of 77%. We still expect a product gross margin headwind in the fourth quarter associated with new products. We are increasing our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP operating margin guidance. We now expect non-GAAP operating margin of 7%. We are increasing our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin. We now expect non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin of 27%. For the full-year, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 361 million. We are on track to add more than 1,000 employees this year, inclusive of M&A. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. I'll add to that, too, that why we see that stabilization is nine out of our top 10 customers all grew quarterly sequentially. And the other point I'll make is we are seeing a shift, as Frank mentioned. Our biggest customers are mature enterprises we're seeing now and mature enterprises have always scrutinized cost. They always will. And so there's nothing new there, and that will continue. And that's just the way anyone should run a business. Yes. So first of all, in general, with sales and marketing heads, most of those typically are added right at the end of Q4 or even more so at the beginning of Q1, so people can get involved in our sales kickoff. And what I would say is we are continuing to invest very heavily in our sales and marketing function, in particular, in Europe. We talked about six months ago or so, we added a new leader there. We have been changing out some people and investing, and we're continuing to, and we will continue to prune underperformers globally and invest more in the right people as we go forward. And APJ is another one that we continue to invest in. Well, they're definitely helping with stabilization. I can't quantify exactly what unstructured is doing, but it's not just that. It's also we're starting to see the effects more of Snowpark that's doing very well for us right now. Some of the new things we're already seeing very early uptick in streaming and dynamic tables. We really, I would say, Streamlit is built into our forecast for next year. The other products because they're new, we really don't build much in for that because we need history before we can do that. And clearly, we think a lot of these new products that are just going into public preview now and GA next year will be a catalyst for growth for us in 2025. Federal is a huge opportunity, and I would say it's upside for us because it's such a small piece, but we should have our FedRAMP high authorization literally any day. I actually thought I might have had it today. So stay tuned. You'll see an announcement on that very soon. Well, as we told you before, every year, we count on a 5% headwind associated with software hardware improvements. Graviton 4 was just announced recently. We really have not tested that and not all hardware improvements benefit our software. We expect there will be some, but we just don't know. It's too early, stay tuned and we'll update you when we have more information. So I'll start with -- I'm not going to guide to NRR. I do see it stabilizing. It could dip a little bit more. I do expect over time, NRR, as we've said, we'll converge with our revenue growth. at the size we're at. And clearly, the biggest puts and takes for next year is going to be the -- to continue to see the stabilization we have we're seeing right now and what the impact of a lot of our new initiatives are going to be next year, and it's just too early to tell right now and to guide to that. So stay tuned for our February call when we give guidance for next year. Well, typically, large enterprises are the ones using our business critical in BPS, and those guys are becoming bigger and bigger customers. And as a result, we do see more of our revenue being derived from these very large companies who are using our higher SKU, which has higher margin for us, and that's what we're seeing there. What I would say is trends are good, but you have to remember, it also has a big holiday in the U.S. and the week of Thanksgiving is typically a slow week. With that said, I'm happy with the consumption we're seeing, and that's reflected in our guidance. Well, what I would say, and I'll repeat what I've said at numerous times to investors, optimizations are part of our life. They've been happening at Snowflake from day 1, they will continue to happen. Nothing is new with optimization. I don't see any big ones happening now, but that's not to say they won't happen in the future, because history has shown they happen all the time. Most of the growth that we're seeing within our customers is we talked about two of our biggest growth customers was on-prem legacy migrations into Snowflake. So there's initial migrations, but we're also seeing new workload expansion within existing customers as well, too. So it's -- there's no one thing that's driving it. It's just general consumption we're seeing. And I will say Snowpark is starting to kick in for us. Still not 10% of our revenue. That's a long ways to get there, but it's still meaningful for us. Yes. I'll just add to that, Derrick, too, on your question about Global 2000. Yes, we added two Global 2000 last quarter. And as I've said many times before, selling into a Global 2000 as a campaign, it's a one to two, sometimes three year sales cycle. With that said, we have a number of Global 2000 in our pipeline for Q4. And what I also want to see, too, is not every Global 2000 starts with an on-prem migration. Many of them start with a first-gen cloud solution they had purchased to migrate to Snowflake. Yes, almost all of them have an on-prem estate, but that doesn't always happen at first. It really varies by customer. But with that said, we still see a lot of on-prem migration to be done over the coming years, and it's going to be for many, many years. No. I don't see that, that much. The only time you see pay-as-you-go are ones who had signed a 3-year contract and then they run out of capacity. And then they just pay as they go. Actually, one of our top 10 customers is like that. They have until April to continue before they have to do another contract, if they want to get the same pricing that they have. I actually expect Q4 is going to be a pretty significant bookings quarter with a number of renewals that are up or customers are going to do something. And we continue to push for three-year contracts with our customers. Payment terms, I do expect though that is one of the things I'd rather give up on payment terms and discount to price per credit. And that's really, I've said it all along, I anticipate longer term, customers will want to do more monthly in arrears payment terms, and that is available to customers. It all comes down to what price you want to pay per credit. And to date, most people want the lower price per credit and are willing to pay annually in advance. I think it's still too early to tell. I will say -- we have one customer doing a significant migration, which will increase their consumption on Snowflake to roughly $1.5 million a year. And there are a number of those that we've identified in POCs, but we haven't done the migrations. I see that 1 customer going into production right now, which, by the way, has saved them significantly on their legacy vendor. So clearly, the -- with some customers, it's quite meaningful, the consumption we're starting to see, and we expect that trend will continue into next year. No. AWS by far is our biggest, followed by Azure and then GCP. GCP is up to 3% right now. Microsoft Azure is the fastest-growing one, but AWS is still 76% of our business with Microsoft being 21%. As I said, GCP is 3%. And I will tell you, 1 of the reasons why GCP is not as big as just so much more expensive for our customers to operate in GCP than it is in AWS and Azure. And as a result, our salespeople are really not inclined to do much in GCP. Post Labor Day. No, these are just all very large customers with massive data estates that continue to -- one was doing a big migration, but the others are just continuing to move workloads to Snowflake. Yes. I don't really see a lot of upside in our long-term guidance and for a number of reasons. The big headwind that we're seeing this quarter to our margin is with all these new products, that are going into public preview. We have to start to amortize the costs associated with the software development costs that we're required to capitalize under GAAP that are now going to start to be amortized on top of that. In particular, something like Unistar, a lot of times when we introduce new products, many times, we actually have negative contribution margins until it takes us usually up to half a year to nine months to actually fine-tune the software to get the -- to take costs out of operating those new features. And so we just have so many new products that are coming out this quarter that is going to have a headwind on the margin."

I would now like to pass the call over to your host, Jimmy Sexton, Head of Investor Relations at Snowflake. You may proceed.\nJimmy Sexton: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Snowflake's Q2 fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me in Bozeman, Montana are Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer; and Christian Kleinerman, our Senior Vice President of Product, who will join us for the Q&A... [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, it does look like the speakers have disconnected. One moment while we get them reconnected. [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, we have the speakers back in the call. You may proceed with the presentation.\nJimmy Sexton: Good afternoon, again, and thank you for joining us on Snowflake's Q2 fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me in Bozeman, Montana are Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer; and Christian Kleinerman, our Senior Vice President of Product, who will join us for the Q&A session. During today's call, we will review our financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2024 and discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2024. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, products and features, long-term growth, our stock repurchase program, and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning these risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2023, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2023, that we will file with the SEC. We caution you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or changes in our expectations. We'd also like to point out that on today's call, we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. To see the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings press release distributed earlier today and our investor presentation, which are posted at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks, Jimmy. Welcome, and good afternoon. Q2 product revenue grew 37% year-over-year to reach $640 million. Non-GAAP product gross margin expanded to 78%. And non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $88 million, representing 50% year-over-year growth. In Q2, we continued to execute in an unsettled macro environment, but with incremental improvement in general sentiments and engagement. Generative AI is at the forefront of customer conversations. However, enterprises are also realizing that they cannot have an AI strategy without a data strategy to base it on. We have a head-start in this race, with the epicenter of highly curated, optimized and trusted enterprise data. We now have a presence was 639 Global 2000 customers. AI reaches beyond enterprise boundaries. Models need external data to answer challenging questions. Data sharing makes Snowflake uniquely positioned to enable AI workloads. As of Q2, 26% of Snowflake customers are data sharing, up from 20% in the same period last year. Approximately 70% of customers with more than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue are data sharing with an average of six stable edges. For years, we focused on the programmability of our platform via Snowpark. We are seeing momentum. In Q2, we added more than 400 Snowpark customers and our consumption grew approximately 70% quarter-over-quarter. The 63% of our Global 2000 customers are using Snowpark on a weekly basis. Document AI is now in Private Preview. With Document AI, customers can use natural language to ask questions of unstructured data. Legal contracts or invoices are now available for inquiry and analytics. This is an early example of how language models are expanding our opportunity. With Snowflake Container Services, we are bringing LLM models like Reka and NVIDIA's NeMo into Snowflake. You heard in my conversation with Jensen, Snowflake is sitting on a goldmine of data. Together, we can help customers turn that goldmine into intelligence. We announced Snowpark Container Services two months ago. Since then, hundreds of customers have requested access to the Private Preview. With our support of Iceberg Tables, we are expanding our data lake scope. Many customers already use Snowflake as a data lake. Large financial services customer consolidates data in Snowflake to eliminate useless extract and transfers of data. This means new use cases are deployed 80% faster. Iceberg Tables will bring additional scope in open file formats to Snowflake. We expect to unlock more data lake opportunities with these capabilities. We've also reached an inflection point on the applications front. At Summit, we launched so-called Native Apps in Public Preview. And we have over 25 native application providers today. Snowflake is a save, certified, and sanctioned place to deploy applications. Grassroots support is building. We now have more than 145,000 monthly active developers on Streamlit. This represents an increase of 160% year-on-year. Our start-up program allocates resources to developers planning to build on Snowflake. Approximately 20% of new customers landed in Q2 landed on Snowflake through our start-up program. General sentiment appears to be incrementally getting better. Snowflake Summit in June was highlight of energy and excitement about what is becoming possible in the world of data. We hosted over 20,000 on-site and virtual attendees. This was up over 85% from last year. Next up is our Data Cloud World Tour. The World Tour brings Summit messaging to a wider audience. We expect to double the attendance of Summit. This is in 26 cities worldwide. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. Consumption came in line with our expectations for the quarter. In May, we saw a return to growth with strength continuing into June and July. From a booking standpoint, we saw promising signs of stabilization with new bookings outperforming our expectations. However, we believe, productivity has room for further improvement. Q2 remaining performance obligations grew 30% year-over-year, totaling $3.5 billion. Of the $3.5 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 57% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. This represents a 32% increase compared to our estimate as of the same quarter last year. Our net revenue retention rate of 142% includes six new customers with $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue. We now have 402 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million. We continue to focus on growth and efficiency. We generated $88 million in non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, outperforming our Q2 target. Q2 represented another quarter of continued progress on profitability. Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 77.9%, benefiting from a one-time credit from one of our cloud service providers. Non-GAAP operating margin was 8%, benefiting from tight controls on headcount additions and the over-achievement in product gross margin. Our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 13%. We continue to have a strong cash position with $4.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, but plan to opportunistically repurchase shares using our free cash flow. Now let's turn to guidance. Our forecast assumes that our largest customers will continue to be a growth headwind. We are seeing encouraging signs of stabilization, but not recovery. Our forecast calls for these customers to more closely align their consumption with their annual contract value. For the third quarter, we expect product revenues between $670 million and $675 million, representing year-over-year growth between 28% and 29%. Turning to margins, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, 4% operating margin. And we expect 364 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2024, we expect product revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 34%. Turning to profitability. For the full year fiscal 2024, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, approximately 76% product gross margin, 5% operating margin, and 26% adjusted free cash flow margin. And we expect 362 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. We will continue to prioritize hiring in product and engineering. We still expect to add approximately 1,000 employees in fiscal 2024, inclusive of M&A. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will be from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, guys. Mike, I wanted to dig into the comment about kind of a large customer activity. You talked to us about sort of consumption coming more in line with the committed contracts. Can you give us any visibility what's happening on the contract renewals? Because as you go through these big contract renewals, are you seeing any change in their behavior of what the large customers are willing to commit to you? And any impacts that we should be thinking about on how that's going to impact bookings and sort of RPO on a go-forward basis?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. No, we're seeing customers renew. This quarter was a good renewal quarter. We had our largest customer, they renewed under their existing terms. They did a $100 million three-year renewal, even though their revenue run rate is at a higher amount than that. I think we did $9 million or $10 million plus TCV deals this quarter and most of those were renewals. And so, customers are doing that. But remember, that doesn't necessarily equate to consumption, and we do know some of our largest customers are trying to consume at their contract rate rather than going above that.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. So, the dynamic is really on consumption, it is not on contracting as of yet?\nMike Scarpelli: No. It's around consumption. As I said, the contracting, actually feel the sentiment really just seems to change in July with customers really re-engaging with us. And so -- and I think we'll have good bookings, but that doesn't equate to consumption. It takes time for the consumption to come in.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. And then, if I can sneak one in for Frank as well. You talked about, you need a good data strategy to have a good AI strategy and that's something we hear a lot when we're talking to customers and people out there in the field. So that really resonates. When it comes to kind of go-to-market and sort of the selling motion, does having to have the gen AI conversation while a long-term positive, does that disrupt the sort of typical kind of data cloud discussion that you guys have been having for the past like five years with these customers? Does it have that risk or has it been elongating the sales cycles in a real way?\nFrank Slootman: No. I would say so, Keith. I think we were actually saying that having highly organized optimized, trusted, sanctioned data is incredibly important for deploying large language models. If you think you can just drop a model on top of a data lake and just see what happens, that's not going to end well and that's what people are realizing. So, they really got to get super serious about their foundations, before -- if you don't have a good foundation, there's not much you can build on top of that. There's tons of governance issues involved as well. We spent literally decades as an industry making data highly governed. In other words, who can have access to what. So that now needs to translate into the world of large language models as well. So, there's tons of questions that are coming up that are really important for the enablement of language models and AI generally. So, being extremely organized on your data is going to become a premium thing. And we're obviously -- that's -- we've been on that, but it has become more important as a function of this.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Yes, it definitely resonates with the competition we're having as well. So, thank you very much for the time guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. Frank, I'm wondering if you can speak to the expanded Microsoft relationship. I believe you referred to it as nearly a doubling of the commitment. And I'm wondering if you're optimistic on seeing that alignment in the field coming together and perhaps unlocking some new opportunities relating to Azure or even some of the OpenAI workloads that you wouldn't have seen previously. Then I have a quick follow-up.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. Look, the bottom line of working with the cloud vendors is not what gets set at the top levels, the good intentions. What matters is what are the incentives when you get 14 layer down at street level, how do get -- people get paid, that determines whether they're either going to fight you and double and triple down on that or they're going to partner with you. And we see models where we've worked out really, really well, of course, with AWS. But Microsoft, we were not in the place that we wanted to be at street level in terms of the incentives. So, we really took this opportunity when we were renegotiating our relationship with Microsoft to say, \"Hey, we have to tackle this, right?\" And Microsoft very much wanted to be a bigger percentage of our business and because they are not punching at their weight at all. They're not as a bigger percentage of our business as they should be based on their market share, and they want to be. And this is the way to do it. It's really you need to bring alignment to the field organizations, then you're going to get partnerships and then you're going to get joint selling and then you're going to get your fair share.\nMark Murphy: Okay, thank you for that. And Mike, as a follow-up. In Q2, did you observe any customers adjusting their indexing or reducing data retention timelines? It looks like the quarter went well overall. But I'm curious if you sense any more or less of that optimization activity heading into the second half here.\nMike Scarpelli: In terms of customers changing their retention policy, we really didn't notice any of that. If anything, we saw growth in the amount of storage in the quarter. And I just want to call it, there was really one large customer that changed the retention from five to three years, that was pretty unusual. And in terms of optimizations, we continually work with customers on their own optimizations, but we're continuing to optimize our software as well too, because we are really dedicated to delivering price performance for our customers. And I want to stress, we've been talking about optimizations with investors since we went public. These will always continue optimizations, whether it's customer or us doing the optimizations, because history has shown, when we improve price performance, more workloads come to us.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. Mike, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the comment you're seeing stabilization in consumption, but not recovery. I'm just kind of curious when you say that, is that the pressure from the top-down on practitioners starting to ease a little bit and they're starting to feel better about what they can consume and then there's waiting for budgets to kind of get refreshed to sort of get going on the recovery side. I'm just kind of curious if it's sort of the top-downs easing or it's more that they're taking a little while to sort of ramp back up on projects that perhaps they've slowed down six months ago, three months ago.\nMike Scarpelli: I actually think it's both, but I definitely think the fact that we kind of saw customers more reengaging with us in July on contracts and that continues into this quarter, I think it is easing a little bit at the top level in terms of approvals for customers and they're willing to commit. But it takes time to convert that to consumption. With that said, consumption is good. It was really good today as an example. But it's only one data point. We want to see more days of that before we think the -- we're into a real recovery. I think stabilization is the right term. We're not seeing customers reduce their consumption right now.\nKirk Materne: Okay. And then Frank, just as you spoke to a lot of executives at Summit, do they recognize the fact that the road to AI does require perhaps a heavier level of investment than they were thinking 12 months ago? How do you think that factors into sort of their thinking on budgets as we go into '24? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. The reality is, they don't really know yet, in any real definitive terms, what this is going to take. I mean I think a lot of people, I think this is correct, they have characterized their foray into language models as experimental exploratory and sort of trying to get their arms around how big a breadth box is this. So it's going to take a while before we get a real read of what the level of investment is. There are people who are going to -- stomach to do this. I mean one of the challenges -- one of the great things about search historically has been that search, also had a very potent business model that go with it to pay for it and we cannot sort of unleash AI and have no business model that pay for, and people will get tired of that really, really quick. So these are -- GPUs from NVIDIA, they aren't cheap, as powerful as they are. So, we all have to bring that into alignment and into focus and have a sensible go-forward strategy. So, a lot of the use cases we'll focus on, what are we getting for this, right? This is not just fun and games and planning your next trip to Yellowstone. People are going to be asking very, very hard-hitting questions, \"What is this doing for us?\"\nKirk Materne: Thank you, all.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Great to see the stabilization as well from my end, congrats there. Frank, one for you more -- as you -- as we all realize that data is kind of the new fuel, we do see more [indiscernible] like, oh, no, I have the data, I have to data, which kind of in a way like kind of puts them on a slightly different course than it used to be compared to your partnership. How do you see that competitive landscape evolving for you, since you, in theory, are the natural kind of holding source for data that is used in AI? How do you see this playing out for you guys? Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: Well, we see it play out really well. I think we agree with you. I mean, we think that data is becoming infinitely valuable and that's for all kinds of reasons, because we can no longer run enterprises and institutions based on what we call anecdotal observation because the world is too dynamic, too disruptive and we have this massive disintermediation happening. We no longer have all these intermediaries between us and the end customer. You can only run direct-to-consumer businesses with data. I mean, you see that, for example, in insurance like auto industry, companies like GEICO and Progressive and Liberty Mutual, I mean, you can only run these businesses on top of data, telemetry data being really important. And we think every business, every institution is going to develop a complete and total dependency not just on data, but the ability to harness that data. So, this is a full-on transformation really of how industry and institutions have operated and worked at the leading edge of it, but we're also very much at the beginning of it.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is now open.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. So, Mike, just wanted -- maybe two quickies. You mentioned there was a one-time credit from one of the CSPs. Are you able to define how material that was? It sounds like it might have certainly hit gross margins. But just wanted to clarify.\nMike Scarpelli: That was about $4 million that hit in the quarter.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe just a follow-up. Mike, what I'm hearing you describe is an effort, you mentioned, certainly, your largest customer, but perhaps others taking their usage a little bit closer to their ACV. So, one would think that that would result in a decent amount of headwind, yet your guidance for the third quarter, in my judgment anyway, is relatively solid. So, what's the offset? What customer segment might be ramping nicely to offset to some extent the headwinds from your large customers? Thanks so much.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, we're now at 639 Global 2000 that are only consuming on average on a trailing 12 months at around $1.5 million, $1.6 million. A lot of those are still doing their migrations and we don't see that stopping. It's the larger customers. They just are not forecast to grow as quickly. They're still growing, but at a slower pace. Now, that -- once again, this is a consumption model, that could turn around tomorrow.\nKarl Keirstead: Yeah. I get it. Okay. Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much. Frank, I think your fireside chat with Jensen was absolutely illuminating. He was looking at the opportunity set with structured data in the Snowflake ecosystem and almost salivating, and yet you seemed a little moderated and that you need to have a business case. So, when are we likely to reach a point where Generative AI coupled with Snowpark could really lead to a tangible increase in consumption outside of the core data cloud business? And one for you, Mike. If we are to read your comments, three months of stability, four months of stability, it looks like including August, does that mean that net expansion rates reach a bottom and could potentially start to stabilize and rebound as we head into the later part of the year? Thank you so much.\nFrank Slootman: Well, it's Frank, Kash. I mean, in the really short term, I'm only talking days, weeks, and months here, where you're going to see language model begin to immediately impact the business is that SQL generation. I mean, in other words, the analyst job is going to be up leveled so much. I think people are going to be able to drive queries into the data much better, much faster with far less skill requirement than they ever have before, and we're showing that off every day. So, I mean, these days, you don't even have to be literate in order to be able to have interactions with your data. So that really is an expansion vector that is just enormously and it's very close to home, that gives us really how you use data and how you use a platform like Snowflake. The other area where you're going to see drivers of workloads is that people get to search for data related to what their general angle of inquiry is in a much more effective manner than they have been able before. And this is also where it's very important that you can search beyond enterprise boundaries, because the context of data is not limited by your enterprise boundaries. We can go on and on and on about our use cases, there is a million of them. As you get further down, you can start asking really, really hard questions that in prior periods, prior eras, we really needed to launch whole analyst teams to go research and investigate topics, where now the data will be able to -- the systems will be able to generate queries and the type of data that will immediately, very, very quickly begin to generate insights. And that's by the way, that's going to become the leading edge for structured proprietary data, which is, of course, the center of our universe.\nMike Scarpelli: And on your question on net revenue retention, I just want to remind you I'm not going to guide to net revenue retention. But I do think over time it is going to continue to converge closer to our growth rate. I do think it will stabilize, but I do expect it's going to come down slightly from where it's at right now just in what we're seeing today.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thank you so much. I've got one for Frank and one for Mike. Frank, stable edges continue to tick up, which is great to see, and I know it's an important metric for the company and its strategic vision. Anything else perhaps qualitative that you can share in terms of how data sharing is progressing? And for you Mike, great to see the margin upside, everybody is happy about it. But with such a huge opportunity, how can you be sure you're striking the right balance of investment, especially when you're up against such well-capitalized competitors? Thanks, guys.\nFrank Slootman: On the topic of data sharing, we instrument that whole side of the business very, very carefully and we drive it on a quarterly basis. But sometimes data edges are very enterprise-specific. In other words, they just have things, the use cases, that just pertain to their business and these are bilateral relationships between Snowflake accounts and different institutions. But where it gets really interesting, where you get real network effect kicking in, is when you have industries or sub-industries where data sharing just makes sense. And obviously, in financial institutions, because financial institutions inherently have been pumping data around in massive, massive volumes for -- literally for generations. This is an absolute no-brainer. And we do the vast majority, historically data edges have been in the financial services sectors become almost a standard. This is how we move data from A to B to C. Asset management particularly has a really big need for that. But the other area, and again, this is an industry, in supply chain management. I mean, in the supply chain, there are multiple entities to the degree that they all have Snowflake accounts, it's very easy to get visibility and supply chain across entities and being able to flag supply chain events much earlier and get visibility to that. So once you're in a supply chain, there need to be on Snowflake and share data with your supply chain partners is going to become very, very compelling. And we announced at Summit and even earlier our relationship with Blue Yonder, for example, which is really the largest software company in the world in supply chain management, that they are re-platforming on Snowflake. So, we think that's another sort industry/sub-industry where every manufacturer, every retailer is going to become an opportunity for us. So it's a little bit of color on how these things develop from our perspective.\nMike Scarpelli: On your question on investments in the business, Brad, given the opportunity, we are investing as fast as we think we need to invest. You did see the guided margins to 4% for operating margin where we just did 5% this quarter and that's because we're investing. As an example, we have a 1,000 H1100 GPUs reserved, that's an extra $1 million a month as we're working on AI. I'm not getting requests that people need more headcount in the engineering organization and the sales and marketing. Until we see an increase in productivity, we're going to be very methodical about how we add resources into those areas. So, we're definitely not under-investing in the business, at least I'm not getting the feedback from any of the executive team with regards to that.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks for the additional color.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is now open.\nTyler Radke: Yes, thanks for taking the question. First question just on the commentary around some of the projects you are starting to see better momentum there, particularly in July. I was wondering if you could just comment on the nature of those projects. Are they larger deals than you typically see or maybe they include more Generative AI or data science given all the new products that you released? If you could just kind of contrast the pickup and kind of where that's coming from?\nFrank Slootman: Yeah, just -- you want to get going?\nMike Scarpelli: You, go ahead, Frank.\nFrank Slootman: So, you shouldn't equate projects with deals, okay, because there is tons and tons of projects going on and projects relate to use cases and workloads and applications. But what we said in the prepared remarks is, we've really seen a sort of a sentiment change from the earlier quarters where people were sort of trying to cut off their limbs to fit within budgetary constraints and all these kinds of stuff. And then where do -- and that's why you see unnatural acts to save money. That has really subsided considerably and the conversation is really going back to where it historically has been, as you know, we want to do these applications, these workloads, these migrations. And of course, we're pushing the boundaries on much more sophisticated use cases in machine learning. And obviously, people want to understand how do I deploy large language models on the Snowflake platform. And we have outlined that an excruciating detail and demonstrated, showcased how we are doing that and we're super excited about how that's unfolding for us and our customers.\nTyler Radke: Great. And then follow-up, just in terms of the Snowpark revenue. Any update on kind of where you're expecting that to track as you exit this year? And then these related services, whether it's the Native App Store or Container Services, would that all fall under Snowpark theoretically when that goes GA next year? Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: In terms of Snowpark, as we said, whereas Frank talked about seeing 70% growth in Snowpark consumption, still relatively small, but meaningful. We have a number of customers that are in the process of doing their migrations, a few quite large ones. I do think next year, it will be more meaningful to revenue. But on $2.6 billion in revenue, it's a couple of percent of our revenue this year.\nFrank Slootman: Once that container services become primetime and that is part of Snowpark, obviously, that means any workload becomes a fair game to be deployed on Snowflake. This is obviously running close to the data, inside our governance perimeter, it's essentially virtualization for the cloud. So, we think there is enormous upside for us once those services become generally available across all our cloud platforms.\nMike Scarpelli: Which will be next year.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thill: Mike, you mentioned at the Analyst Day you are idling back quota-carrying sales capacity on the new hire front. Have you seen any difference to lean back into hiring quota reps in '23?\nMike Scarpelli: It really depends upon the territory and the opportunity. There are some territories where kind of regions we're shrinking where it's overcapacity, and we're re-shifting those heads to other more productive territories as we -- I'm not planning on adding net a lot of new ones for the balance of this year. But as we're starting to plan for next year, there are -- there is additional headcount going into the quota carrying rep area.\nBrent Thill: Great. And for Frank, on the vertical side, any verticals that are showing more excitement that perhaps weren't online that weren't firing up? Are you seeing anything change here?\nFrank Slootman: Actually, that's a great question, because we had massive outperformance by our healthcare vertical this quarter, and healthcare usually runs fourth or fifth in the lineup of verticals and a massive way to [Technical Difficulty] really excited about, it feels like that healthcare is really getting a move on, if you will. They have not traditionally been an aggressive adopter of technology. But in the world of data, they are moving. They're moving hard and you see it on the provider side, you see it on the payer side, you see it on the pharma side. So I think that's going to become a great contributing segment for us.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. Healthcare and life sciences grew 61% year-over-year in revenue for us.\nBrent Thill: Thanks for the color.\nMike Scarpelli: Very good, too.\nOperator: The next question will be from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great. Thanks. Appreciate taking the question. I think one of the comments mentioned new bookings outperformed expectations. I appreciate you're still seeing room for improvement, but anything you can add around what drove the improvement versus last quarter? It sounded like healthcare from the prior commentary, but wondering if some of that or certain product releases maybe also contributed there.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. Hard to say whether -- I don't think it was a product release. I would say we saw some nice renewals from customers with growth. We also saw two very large Cap Ones, one large one in Europe, which was -- Cap One is an initial deal, it was a $22 million TCV deal in an insurance industry, and we saw a large gaming company in Korea commit to $9.5 million as a Cap One. So clearly, our message is getting across to these customers, and they see what we're doing and a lot of these want to do more in the area of AI. But first, they need to get their data into Snowflake and it's going to be a journey for these people. It's not going to happen overnight AI for our customers.\nMichael Turrin: I like and appreciate those large deal stats. Maybe just quickly on the back half. If you can just help level set what's embedded in the rest of the year outlook? You've seen multiple comments around stabilization. Is that fairly consistent with what informs the outlook and maybe just any refresh on second half seasonality as expected? Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: Well, Q4 is usually one of our largest bookings quarter and it's shaping up, but that's not necessarily consumption. And -- but the sentiment within our sales team has definitely shifted from where it was in the first half of the year.\nMichael Turrin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Patrick Colville with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Colville: All right. Thank you so much for taking my question. I just want to double-click on your comments. I think you said customers are reengaging in July. You said that in the prepared remarks. I mean, I guess, what do you mean by that? Is it new customers, existing customers, consumption, contract negotiations? And then, any color you can give us on thus far in August would be helpful.\nMike Scarpelli: All three of the above. We have new customers. I just pointed out those two large Cap Ones. We usually don't do Cap Ones that big, and it was a very good quarter with some large new customers. We're seeing our existing customers. We saw some nice early renewals with customers where they were consuming faster. And we're seeing customers willing to do larger deals rather than just do a co-term to bridge them through to another period. So that's what I mean by the sentiment is changing with our customers.\nPatrick Colville: All right. I guess my kind of follow-up is -- I mean, NVIDIA reported results tonight. I think looking at the numbers, the data center revenue rose by 150% sequentially. But clearly, like AI spend is hitting the silicon layer. I mean a question I get from investors is when will AI spend more clearly hit the software layer? I mean, do you have any thoughts on that?\nMike Scarpelli: I think it's going to be next year. As I said, it's going to take some time for AI. And people are still struggling to get GPUs and there is a time lag between when a chip manufacturer sells their chips to it gets built into the hardware that actually gets deployed in a rack in a data center, and it gets deployed to customers.\nFrank Slootman: I think you will see the leading actually happening in months to come. But the material impact, I think most analysts out there are seeing in 2024 and we tend to agree with that.\nMike Scarpelli: And I would say in my prior life, when we were buying racks of servers, there's a six-month delay between when we bought them and when they were actually going into production. And I don't see that any different with GPUs.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nEthan Bruck: This is Ethan Bruck on for Alex Zukin. I just had a quick kind of numbers question. So, if we calculate the product revenue of cRPO booking growth, it decelerated to 13% from about 30% last quarter. So, just curious, how should we think about this as an indicator of future consumption for future product growth?\nMike Scarpelli: So, I guided to full year revenue at $2.6 billion, and we'll guide next year next year.\nEthan Bruck: Okay. And then I guess just to ask the August trends question in a different way. I guess, has some of the stability you called out trended into August kind of the first one for the quarter? And then just on the seasonality, is there any kind of month to note as you think about the rest of the year that seems that either seasonally strong or seasonally weak?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, as I said, August is shaping up very good. I called out yesterday, it was actually a very good consumption, but one day doesn't make a trend. Q4 is definitely seasonality with the holidays with Thanksgiving in the U.S. and the Christmas holidays that does impact daily consumption. From a bookings perspective, Q4 though, is clearly our largest bookings.\nEthan Bruck: Got it. Makes sense. Okay. Thank you, and congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. I wanted to go back to the discussion around the increase we're seeing in model training capacity. Clearly, billions of incremental dollars going into NVIDIA GPUs here. You need data to train the models. I appreciate there's going to be a lag relative to when the spend hits the data layer. But are there any technical hurdles that need to be overcome? Or you do you think this cycle is different and that there are other considerations as well? Just thinking through that -- the investment we're seeing right now in infrastructure and thinking through what are the other factors we need to think about before it starts to impact the data layer? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: I'll start, and then maybe Christian can follow, even think about the question while I'm talking. You can't characterize as AI as one thing, right, because you see the things that people are doing with unstructured data and the whole notion of copilots and the systems and tutors and all that, it's very much focused on contextual data. And we see action with support call records, contact centers and so on. But again, you look at Snowflake, who sits on mountains of structured proprietary enterprise data, that's a different realm for AI than the very text model-oriented type of inquiry. And I have to say that just from all my conversation with customers, I mean people are behind, I would say, the textual side [Technical Difficulty] proprietary data, how we're going to approach that. We view that as our business, and we're driving that very hard, and hence the emphasis on getting your data [indiscernible] in order because you just cannot unleash large language model and hope for the best, because of all the issues that we've mentioned before around governance and just understanding of what kind of data we are generating in the process. That's why I said the early going, you're going to see a lot of upside from [indiscernible] that analysts are going to be able to generate data far quicker, far better than they ever have been before. And we're really massively reducing the skill sophistication requirements to be able to do that. Data in and of itself is going to be a big driver for us.\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. Christian here. I would add maybe two areas in addition to what Frank mentioned. The first one is around having the right data to be fed into these models. Frank started the call with no AI strategy without data strategy. And it is very pleasing that the results of traditional ML or Gen AI is a function of having the right data, the right data quality, the right metrics. The technology will be as good as the data that is fed into. All of the investments that we make on data quality and cleansing and pipelines, all of that is very important. The other piece that I think will be a technical imperative for everyone doing AI and Gen AI is around the measurement and feedback how good are the solutions, how do I know if there are potential buyers into the data or are there gaps in their understanding and performance of the model. Those two are inherent parts of the lifecycle and [interestingly, they all run to] (ph) having a great data foundation enabled service.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color. And then lastly for Mike on consumption, one follow-up. The implied Q4 product growth is, I think, 26% at the midpoint. I know there's a delta between signing growth and consumption. Exiting this year, do you think product growth stabilizes in the mid-20% range, maybe starts to reaccelerate next year, or is it just too early to tell?\nMike Scarpelli: Let us finish Q3, and then we'll guide to Q4, and I'll see how next year is looking. But I do anticipate -- there's a lot of new things coming out next year, that we think are going to have a very positive impact on our consumption from. Remember, we have Streamlit goes into GA, Unistore towards end of this year.\nChristian Kleinerman: Public Preview.\nMike Scarpelli: Public Preview. We have Containerized Services next year. There's a number of things that are happening that are all going to have a positive impact on our revenue growth rate next year. So stay tuned for that.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Gentlemen, you've talked about changing sentiment a couple of times during the call. How much of that is your sales team being better able to engage with the customers selling value, just looking at the problem from a different perspective given the macro trends versus customers just feeling better about their businesses and the macro unleasing the demand? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: It's Frank. Look, it's not the sales team. There's really a change in how customers engage. A couple of quarters ago, like I said earlier, people were doing unnatural acts to force that themselves into spending envelope and they were doing it almost regardless of consequence, that's fixation on that reset, we obviously felt that. The change in sentiment is that, that has passed. We are now sort of, okay, we're comfortable with the path that we're on, now we're talking again of our projects and migrations and use cases. We're trying to basically get a grip on deploying large language models. What do we have to do with data, with the infrastructure, answering governance questions and so on. So in other words, the sentiment is very constructive and engaging on core data strategy, that's a big change from where we were a couple of quarters ago. Obviously, the salespeople are perceiving that as very positive, that's where you want to be.\nBrad Reback: That's great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nDerrick Wood: Thanks. Mike this is the strongest sequential growth quarter you've had in three quarters, I think you were at 6% and 6% and this was 8.5%. Your guidance for Q3, there's kind of 5.5% sequential and further some level of conservatism in there. But just in terms of the Q2, are there any kind of one-time consumption dynamics to call out? Or does that just really kind of inform us that the optimization headwinds that you saw in Q4 and Q1 kind of dissipated in Q2?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. Q2 has more days in it. Remember where consumption model was actually 5% quarter-over-quarter, working days adjusted was the growth rate. And actually Q3, it goes up when you look at the working days in Q3. Remember on a consumption model where really kind of 70% is the scheduled work, there is a big piece that is tied to work days that does have an impact. So, there is growth next quarter in that guide on a days adjusted basis, working days.\nDerrick Wood: Okay. Frank or Christian, I just -- I was hoping to double-click on the new Container Services. It seems like it enables you to deploy different types of third-party engines, apps, code bases directly in the platform. You can streamline a lot more workflows which I think when it comes to building AI models seems pretty interesting. So, I was curious, what are you most excited about in terms of this new capability and opening up new consumption especially when it comes to AI?\nFrank Slootman: Container Services was the absolute hit, star performer at our Snowflake Summit conference. I mean, customers were just mesmerized by the possibilities that a platform capability has because we essentially eliminated any limitation on deployment on Snowflake. And why do you care? I mean the thing is, first of all, you wanted to deploy close to the data for all the reasons that we talk about. This enabled us, you get a fully trusted sanction platform where you can deploy applications without any further questions. And one of the challenges that you have in cloud computing is, who's managing this, right? I mean what is the safe space to deploy into and whose is really guaranteeing the high trust enterprise-grade capabilities of the platform? So, we are bringing that. So, we're going to see a lot of services, a lot of them could be on-premise legacy engines that are going to be containerized and re-service as a cloud service, right? So, a lot of things that were old will be new again. So, it's virtualization for the cloud and having secure, safe, high-performance, very, very efficient spaces to run services and applications. And so, the sky is the limit on this capability, and we and our customers and our partners could not be more excited about the potentials and the possibilities here. But specific to AI, this matters a whole lot because the containers, our vehicle, our vessel, if you will, to deploy large language models, there is no limits on which models and how many models and for what segments of the business we can deploy. And we can shift gears very, very quickly. And we have incredible flexibility in terms of deploying these capabilities, because you're going to see a lot of change and a lot of movements. We've already seen an enormous amount. That's going to continue. So, we're very, very well-positioned architecturally platform-wise to enable the AI revolution with Container Services.\nDerrick Wood: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the final question will be from the line of Sterling Auty with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Just one question from my side. You mentioned sales productivity a couple of times. I'm curious, how would you grade your go-to-market sales execution in quarter? And are there any specific changes that you're making to further optimize given the environment for the back half?\nMike Scarpelli: I think in general, our execution in Q2 on the sales side was actually quite good, it improved. But there is still pockets though, where there is room for improvement when you look in certain territories or geos. We have a new leader in EMEA. EMEA -- certain markets in EMEA doing good. Others, there's a lot of room for improvement. We have a new leader in EMEA. There's certain pockets in Asia that are doing good. But there is others that have a lot of room for improvement. So -- but in general, overall, as I talked about, you can see through our bookings, it was a good execution from bookings perspective in the aggregate last quarter.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude today's Q&A session and today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. And you may now disconnect your lines.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Frank Slootman",
            "content": "Thanks, Jimmy. Welcome, and good afternoon. Q2 product revenue grew 37% year-over-year to reach $640 million. Non-GAAP product gross margin expanded to 78%. And non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $88 million, representing 50% year-over-year growth. In Q2, we continued to execute in an unsettled macro environment, but with incremental improvement in general sentiments and engagement. Generative AI is at the forefront of customer conversations. However, enterprises are also realizing that they cannot have an AI strategy without a data strategy to base it on. We have a head-start in this race, with the epicenter of highly curated, optimized and trusted enterprise data. We now have a presence was 639 Global 2000 customers. AI reaches beyond enterprise boundaries. Models need external data to answer challenging questions. Data sharing makes Snowflake uniquely positioned to enable AI workloads. As of Q2, 26% of Snowflake customers are data sharing, up from 20% in the same period last year. Approximately 70% of customers with more than $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue are data sharing with an average of six stable edges. For years, we focused on the programmability of our platform via Snowpark. We are seeing momentum. In Q2, we added more than 400 Snowpark customers and our consumption grew approximately 70% quarter-over-quarter. The 63% of our Global 2000 customers are using Snowpark on a weekly basis. Document AI is now in Private Preview. With Document AI, customers can use natural language to ask questions of unstructured data. Legal contracts or invoices are now available for inquiry and analytics. This is an early example of how language models are expanding our opportunity. With Snowflake Container Services, we are bringing LLM models like Reka and NVIDIA's NeMo into Snowflake. You heard in my conversation with Jensen, Snowflake is sitting on a goldmine of data. Together, we can help customers turn that goldmine into intelligence. We announced Snowpark Container Services two months ago. Since then, hundreds of customers have requested access to the Private Preview. With our support of Iceberg Tables, we are expanding our data lake scope. Many customers already use Snowflake as a data lake. Large financial services customer consolidates data in Snowflake to eliminate useless extract and transfers of data. This means new use cases are deployed 80% faster. Iceberg Tables will bring additional scope in open file formats to Snowflake. We expect to unlock more data lake opportunities with these capabilities. We've also reached an inflection point on the applications front. At Summit, we launched so-called Native Apps in Public Preview. And we have over 25 native application providers today. Snowflake is a save, certified, and sanctioned place to deploy applications. Grassroots support is building. We now have more than 145,000 monthly active developers on Streamlit. This represents an increase of 160% year-on-year. Our start-up program allocates resources to developers planning to build on Snowflake. Approximately 20% of new customers landed in Q2 landed on Snowflake through our start-up program. General sentiment appears to be incrementally getting better. Snowflake Summit in June was highlight of energy and excitement about what is becoming possible in the world of data. We hosted over 20,000 on-site and virtual attendees. This was up over 85% from last year. Next up is our Data Cloud World Tour. The World Tour brings Summit messaging to a wider audience. We expect to double the attendance of Summit. This is in 26 cities worldwide. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. No. I would say so, Keith. I think we were actually saying that having highly organized optimized, trusted, sanctioned data is incredibly important for deploying large language models. If you think you can just drop a model on top of a data lake and just see what happens, that's not going to end well and that's what people are realizing. So, they really got to get super serious about their foundations, before -- if you don't have a good foundation, there's not much you can build on top of that. There's tons of governance issues involved as well. We spent literally decades as an industry making data highly governed. In other words, who can have access to what. So that now needs to translate into the world of large language models as well. So, there's tons of questions that are coming up that are really important for the enablement of language models and AI generally. So, being extremely organized on your data is going to become a premium thing. And we're obviously -- that's -- we've been on that, but it has become more important as a function of this. Yes. Look, the bottom line of working with the cloud vendors is not what gets set at the top levels, the good intentions. What matters is what are the incentives when you get 14 layer down at street level, how do get -- people get paid, that determines whether they're either going to fight you and double and triple down on that or they're going to partner with you. And we see models where we've worked out really, really well, of course, with AWS. But Microsoft, we were not in the place that we wanted to be at street level in terms of the incentives. So, we really took this opportunity when we were renegotiating our relationship with Microsoft to say, \"Hey, we have to tackle this, right?\" And Microsoft very much wanted to be a bigger percentage of our business and because they are not punching at their weight at all. They're not as a bigger percentage of our business as they should be based on their market share, and they want to be. And this is the way to do it. It's really you need to bring alignment to the field organizations, then you're going to get partnerships and then you're going to get joint selling and then you're going to get your fair share. Yes. The reality is, they don't really know yet, in any real definitive terms, what this is going to take. I mean I think a lot of people, I think this is correct, they have characterized their foray into language models as experimental exploratory and sort of trying to get their arms around how big a breadth box is this. So it's going to take a while before we get a real read of what the level of investment is. There are people who are going to -- stomach to do this. I mean one of the challenges -- one of the great things about search historically has been that search, also had a very potent business model that go with it to pay for it and we cannot sort of unleash AI and have no business model that pay for, and people will get tired of that really, really quick. So these are -- GPUs from NVIDIA, they aren't cheap, as powerful as they are. So, we all have to bring that into alignment and into focus and have a sensible go-forward strategy. So, a lot of the use cases we'll focus on, what are we getting for this, right? This is not just fun and games and planning your next trip to Yellowstone. People are going to be asking very, very hard-hitting questions, \"What is this doing for us?\" Well, we see it play out really well. I think we agree with you. I mean, we think that data is becoming infinitely valuable and that's for all kinds of reasons, because we can no longer run enterprises and institutions based on what we call anecdotal observation because the world is too dynamic, too disruptive and we have this massive disintermediation happening. We no longer have all these intermediaries between us and the end customer. You can only run direct-to-consumer businesses with data. I mean, you see that, for example, in insurance like auto industry, companies like GEICO and Progressive and Liberty Mutual, I mean, you can only run these businesses on top of data, telemetry data being really important. And we think every business, every institution is going to develop a complete and total dependency not just on data, but the ability to harness that data. So, this is a full-on transformation really of how industry and institutions have operated and worked at the leading edge of it, but we're also very much at the beginning of it. Well, it's Frank, Kash. I mean, in the really short term, I'm only talking days, weeks, and months here, where you're going to see language model begin to immediately impact the business is that SQL generation. I mean, in other words, the analyst job is going to be up leveled so much. I think people are going to be able to drive queries into the data much better, much faster with far less skill requirement than they ever have before, and we're showing that off every day. So, I mean, these days, you don't even have to be literate in order to be able to have interactions with your data. So that really is an expansion vector that is just enormously and it's very close to home, that gives us really how you use data and how you use a platform like Snowflake. The other area where you're going to see drivers of workloads is that people get to search for data related to what their general angle of inquiry is in a much more effective manner than they have been able before. And this is also where it's very important that you can search beyond enterprise boundaries, because the context of data is not limited by your enterprise boundaries. We can go on and on and on about our use cases, there is a million of them. As you get further down, you can start asking really, really hard questions that in prior periods, prior eras, we really needed to launch whole analyst teams to go research and investigate topics, where now the data will be able to -- the systems will be able to generate queries and the type of data that will immediately, very, very quickly begin to generate insights. And that's by the way, that's going to become the leading edge for structured proprietary data, which is, of course, the center of our universe. On the topic of data sharing, we instrument that whole side of the business very, very carefully and we drive it on a quarterly basis. But sometimes data edges are very enterprise-specific. In other words, they just have things, the use cases, that just pertain to their business and these are bilateral relationships between Snowflake accounts and different institutions. But where it gets really interesting, where you get real network effect kicking in, is when you have industries or sub-industries where data sharing just makes sense. And obviously, in financial institutions, because financial institutions inherently have been pumping data around in massive, massive volumes for -- literally for generations. This is an absolute no-brainer. And we do the vast majority, historically data edges have been in the financial services sectors become almost a standard. This is how we move data from A to B to C. Asset management particularly has a really big need for that. But the other area, and again, this is an industry, in supply chain management. I mean, in the supply chain, there are multiple entities to the degree that they all have Snowflake accounts, it's very easy to get visibility and supply chain across entities and being able to flag supply chain events much earlier and get visibility to that. So once you're in a supply chain, there need to be on Snowflake and share data with your supply chain partners is going to become very, very compelling. And we announced at Summit and even earlier our relationship with Blue Yonder, for example, which is really the largest software company in the world in supply chain management, that they are re-platforming on Snowflake. So, we think that's another sort industry/sub-industry where every manufacturer, every retailer is going to become an opportunity for us. So it's a little bit of color on how these things develop from our perspective. Yeah, just -- you want to get going? So, you shouldn't equate projects with deals, okay, because there is tons and tons of projects going on and projects relate to use cases and workloads and applications. But what we said in the prepared remarks is, we've really seen a sort of a sentiment change from the earlier quarters where people were sort of trying to cut off their limbs to fit within budgetary constraints and all these kinds of stuff. And then where do -- and that's why you see unnatural acts to save money. That has really subsided considerably and the conversation is really going back to where it historically has been, as you know, we want to do these applications, these workloads, these migrations. And of course, we're pushing the boundaries on much more sophisticated use cases in machine learning. And obviously, people want to understand how do I deploy large language models on the Snowflake platform. And we have outlined that an excruciating detail and demonstrated, showcased how we are doing that and we're super excited about how that's unfolding for us and our customers. Once that container services become primetime and that is part of Snowpark, obviously, that means any workload becomes a fair game to be deployed on Snowflake. This is obviously running close to the data, inside our governance perimeter, it's essentially virtualization for the cloud. So, we think there is enormous upside for us once those services become generally available across all our cloud platforms. Actually, that's a great question, because we had massive outperformance by our healthcare vertical this quarter, and healthcare usually runs fourth or fifth in the lineup of verticals and a massive way to [Technical Difficulty] really excited about, it feels like that healthcare is really getting a move on, if you will. They have not traditionally been an aggressive adopter of technology. But in the world of data, they are moving. They're moving hard and you see it on the provider side, you see it on the payer side, you see it on the pharma side. So I think that's going to become a great contributing segment for us. I think you will see the leading actually happening in months to come. But the material impact, I think most analysts out there are seeing in 2024 and we tend to agree with that. I'll start, and then maybe Christian can follow, even think about the question while I'm talking. You can't characterize as AI as one thing, right, because you see the things that people are doing with unstructured data and the whole notion of copilots and the systems and tutors and all that, it's very much focused on contextual data. And we see action with support call records, contact centers and so on.

And we can shift gears very, very quickly. And we have incredible flexibility in terms of deploying these capabilities, because you're going to see a lot of change and a lot of movements. We've already seen an enormous amount. That's going to continue. So, we're very, very well-positioned architecturally platform-wise to enable the AI revolution with Container Services."

            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Consumption came in line with our expectations for the quarter. In May, we saw a return to growth with strength continuing into June and July. From a booking standpoint, we saw promising signs of stabilization with new bookings outperforming our expectations. However, we believe, productivity has room for further improvement. Q2 remaining performance obligations grew 30% year-over-year, totaling $3.5 billion. Of the $3.5 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 57% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. This represents a 32% increase compared to our estimate as of the same quarter last year. Our net revenue retention rate of 142% includes six new customers with $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue. We now have 402 customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million. We continue to focus on growth and efficiency. We generated $88 million in non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow, outperforming our Q2 target. Q2 represented another quarter of continued progress on profitability. Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 77.9%, benefiting from a one-time credit from one of our cloud service providers. Non-GAAP operating margin was 8%, benefiting from tight controls on headcount additions and the over-achievement in product gross margin. Our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 13%. We continue to have a strong cash position with $4.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, but plan to opportunistically repurchase shares using our free cash flow. Now let's turn to guidance. Our forecast assumes that our largest customers will continue to be a growth headwind. We are seeing encouraging signs of stabilization, but not recovery. Our forecast calls for these customers to more closely align their consumption with their annual contract value. For the third quarter, we expect product revenues between $670 million and $675 million, representing year-over-year growth between 28% and 29%. Turning to margins, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, 4% operating margin. And we expect 364 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2024, we expect product revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 34%. Turning to profitability. For the full year fiscal 2024, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, approximately 76% product gross margin, 5% operating margin, and 26% adjusted free cash flow margin. And we expect 362 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. We will continue to prioritize hiring in product and engineering. We still expect to add approximately 1,000 employees in fiscal 2024, inclusive of M&A. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Yes. No, we're seeing customers renew. This quarter was a good renewal quarter. We had our largest customer, they renewed under their existing terms. They did a $100 million three-year renewal, even though their revenue run rate is at a higher amount than that. I think we did $9 million or $10 million plus TCV deals this quarter and most of those were renewals. And so, customers are doing that. But remember, that doesn't necessarily equate to consumption, and we do know some of our largest customers are trying to consume at their contract rate rather than going above that. No. It's around consumption. As I said, the contracting, actually feel the sentiment really just seems to change in July with customers really re-engaging with us. And so -- and I think we'll have good bookings, but that doesn't equate to consumption. It takes time for the consumption to come in. In terms of customers changing their retention policy, we really didn't notice any of that. If anything, we saw growth in the amount of storage in the quarter. And I just want to call it, there was really one large customer that changed the retention from five to three years, that was pretty unusual. And in terms of optimizations, we continually work with customers on their own optimizations, but we're continuing to optimize our software as well too, because we are really dedicated to delivering price performance for our customers. And I want to stress, we've been talking about optimizations with investors since we went public. These will always continue optimizations, whether it's customer or us doing the optimizations, because history has shown, when we improve price performance, more workloads come to us. I actually think it's both, but I definitely think the fact that we kind of saw customers more reengaging with us in July on contracts and that continues into this quarter, I think it is easing a little bit at the top level in terms of approvals for customers and they're willing to commit. But it takes time to convert that to consumption. With that said, consumption is good. It was really good today as an example. But it's only one data point. We want to see more days of that before we think the -- we're into a real recovery. I think stabilization is the right term. We're not seeing customers reduce their consumption right now. That was about $4 million that hit in the quarter. Well, we're now at 639 Global 2000 that are only consuming on average on a trailing 12 months at around $1.5 million, $1.6 million. A lot of those are still doing their migrations and we don't see that stopping. It's the larger customers. They just are not forecast to grow as quickly. They're still growing, but at a slower pace. Now, that -- once again, this is a consumption model, that could turn around tomorrow. And on your question on net revenue retention, I just want to remind you I'm not going to guide to net revenue retention. But I do think over time it is going to continue to converge closer to our growth rate. I do think it will stabilize, but I do expect it's going to come down slightly from where it's at right now just in what we're seeing today. On your question on investments in the business, Brad, given the opportunity, we are investing as fast as we think we need to invest. You did see the guided margins to 4% for operating margin where we just did 5% this quarter and that's because we're investing. As an example, we have a 1,000 H1100 GPUs reserved, that's an extra $1 million a month as we're working on AI. I'm not getting requests that people need more headcount in the engineering organization and the sales and marketing. Until we see an increase in productivity, we're going to be very methodical about how we add resources into those areas. So, we're definitely not under-investing in the business, at least I'm not getting the feedback from any of the executive team with regards to that. You, go ahead, Frank. In terms of Snowpark, as we said, whereas Frank talked about seeing 70% growth in Snowpark consumption, still relatively small, but meaningful. We have a number of customers that are in the process of doing their migrations, a few quite large ones. I do think next year, it will be more meaningful to revenue. But on $2.6 billion in revenue, it's a couple of percent of our revenue this year. Which will be next year. It really depends upon the territory and the opportunity. There are some territories where kind of regions we're shrinking where it's overcapacity, and we're re-shifting those heads to other more productive territories as we -- I'm not planning on adding net a lot of new ones for the balance of this year. But as we're starting to plan for next year, there are -- there is additional headcount going into the quota carrying rep area. Yes. Healthcare and life sciences grew 61% year-over-year in revenue for us. Very good, too. Yes. Hard to say whether -- I don't think it was a product release. I would say we saw some nice renewals from customers with growth. We also saw two very large Cap Ones, one large one in Europe, which was -- Cap One is an initial deal, it was a $22 million TCV deal in an insurance industry, and we saw a large gaming company in Korea commit to $9.5 million as a Cap One. So clearly, our message is getting across to these customers, and they see what we're doing and a lot of these want to do more in the area of AI. But first, they need to get their data into Snowflake and it's going to be a journey for these people. It's not going to happen overnight AI for our customers. Well, Q4 is usually one of our largest bookings quarter and it's shaping up, but that's not necessarily consumption. And -- but the sentiment within our sales team has definitely shifted from where it was in the first half of the year. All three of the above. We have new customers. I just pointed out those two large Cap Ones. We usually don't do Cap Ones that big, and it was a very good quarter with some large new customers. We're seeing our existing customers. We saw some nice early renewals with customers where they were consuming faster. And we're seeing customers willing to do larger deals rather than just do a co-term to bridge them through to another period. So that's what I mean by the sentiment is changing with our customers. I think it's going to be next year. As I said, it's going to take some time for AI. And people are still struggling to get GPUs and there is a time lag between when a chip manufacturer sells their chips to it gets built into the hardware that actually gets deployed in a rack in a data center, and it gets deployed to customers. And I would say in my prior life, when we were buying racks of servers, there's a six-month delay between when we bought them and when they were actually going into production. And I don't see that any different with GPUs. So, I guided to full year revenue at $2.6 billion, and we'll guide next year next year. Well, as I said, August is shaping up very good. I called out yesterday, it was actually a very good consumption, but one day doesn't make a trend. Q4 is definitely seasonality with the holidays with Thanksgiving in the U.S. and the Christmas holidays that does impact daily consumption. From a bookings perspective, Q4 though, is clearly our largest bookings. Let us finish Q3, and then we'll guide to Q4, and I'll see how next year is looking. But I do anticipate -- there's a lot of new things coming out next year, that we think are going to have a very positive impact on our consumption from. Remember, we have Streamlit goes into GA, Unistore towards end of this year. Public Preview. We have Containerized Services next year. There's a number of things that are happening that are all going to have a positive impact on our revenue growth rate next year. So stay tuned for that. Yes. Q2 has more days in it. Remember where consumption model was actually 5% quarter-over-quarter, working days adjusted was the growth rate. And actually Q3, it goes up when you look at the working days in Q3. Remember on a consumption model where really kind of 70% is the scheduled work, there is a big piece that is tied to work days that does have an impact. So, there is growth next quarter in that guide on a days adjusted basis, working days. I think in general, our execution in Q2 on the sales side was actually quite good, it improved. But there is still pockets though, where there is room for improvement when you look in certain territories or geos. We have a new leader in EMEA. EMEA -- certain markets in EMEA doing good. Others, there's a lot of room for improvement. We have a new leader in EMEA. There's certain pockets in Asia that are doing good. But there is others that have a lot of room for improvement. So -- but in general, overall, as I talked about, you can see through our bookings, it was a good execution from bookings perspective in the aggregate last quarter."

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jimmy Sexton. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Sexton: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Snowflake's Q1 fiscal 2024 earnings call. With me in Bozeman, Montana are Frank Slootman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer; and Christian Kleinerman, our Senior Vice President of Product, who will join us for the Q&A session. During today's call, we will review our financial results for the first quarter fiscal 2024 and discuss our guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2024. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to the expected performance of our business, future financial results, strategy, products and features, long-term growth, our stock repurchase program and overall future prospects. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after market close today and in our SEC filings, including our most recently filed Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, and the Form 10-Q for quarter ended April 30, 2023, that we will file with the SEC. We caution you to not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and undertake no duty or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or changes in our expectations. We'd also like to point out that on today's call, we will report both GAAP and non-GAAP results. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures are presented in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Slootman: Thanks, Jimmy. Welcome, everybody, listening to today's earnings announcement. Snowflake's product revenue grew 50% in Q1 fiscal year 2024 totaling $590 million. Our net revenue retention rate reached 151%, and remaining performance obligations came in at $3.4 billion, up 31% year-on-year. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $287 million, up 58% year-over-year. We are, however, operating in an unsettled demand environment and we see this reflected in consumption patterns across the board. While enthusiasm for Snowflake is high, enterprises are preoccupied with cost in response to their own uncertainties. We proactively work with customers to optimize their environments. This may well continue near term, but cycles like this eventually run their course. Our conviction in the long-term opportunity remains unchanged. Generative AI with its chat-style of interaction has captured the imagination of society at large. It will bring disruption, productivity, as well as obsolescence to tasks and the entire industries alike. Generative AI is powered by data. That's how models trained and become progressively more interesting and relevant. Models have been primarily been trained with Internet and public data and we believe enterprises will benefit from customizing this technology with their own data. As Snowflake manages a vast and growing universe of public and proprietary data, the data cloud's role in advancing this trend becomes pronounced. AI's focus on large language models and textual data, both structured and unstructured, will lead to rapid proliferation of model types and specializations. Some models will be broadly capable with shallow in functions, others will be deep, specialized and impactful in their specific realm. For years, we focused on the extensibility of our platform via Snowpark, making Snowflake ideally suited for a rapid adoption of new and interesting language models as they become available. AI is also not limited to textual data, equally far reaching will be seen with audio, video and other modalities. The Snowflake mission is to steadily demolish any and all limits to data, users, workloads, applications and new forms of intelligence. You will, therefore, continue to see us add, evolve and expand our functions and feature sets. Our goal is for all the world's data to find its way to Snowflake and not encounter any limitations in terms of use and purpose. From our perspective, machine learning, data science and AI are workloads that we enable with increased capability, continuous performance and efficiency improvements. Data has gravitational pull. And given the vast universe of data Snowflake already manages, it's no surprise that interest in these capabilities is escalating while its uses are still evolving. Data science, machine learning and AI use cases on Snowflake are growing every day. In Q1, more than 1,500 customers leveraged Snowflake for one of these workloads, up 91% year-over-year. A large U.S. financial institution uses Snowflake for model training. Facing memory constraints with their prior solution, they chose to move feature engineering workloads to Snowflake. With Snowflake, they can fully ingest all data, replacing a sampling approach, which left models less predictive and long running. Snowflake enables machine learning for a broad spectrum of user types, not just programmers. For analysts, we have introduced, in preview, ML-powered SQL extensions such as anomaly detection, top insights, and time series forecasting. SQL proficient users can now leverage powerful machine learning extensions without the need to master the underlying data science. For data scientists and engineers, Snowpark is our platform for programmability. New here is a PyTorch data loader and an MLFlow plugin, both in Private Preview. PyTorch is a popular framework for machine learning, and MLFlow helps manage the lifecycle and operations of machine learning. Snowflake had an early start in support of language models through last year's acquisition of Applica, now in Private Preview. Applica's language model solves a real business challenge, understanding unstructured data. Users can turn documents such as invoices or legal contracts into structured properties. These documents are now referenceable for analytics, data science and AI, something that is quite challenging in today's environment. Streamlit is the framework of choice for data scientists to create applications and experiences for AI and ML. Over 1,500 LLM-powered Streamlit apps have already been built. GPT Lab is one example. GPT Lab offers pre-trained AI assistance that can be shared across users. We announced our intent to acquire Neeva, a next-generation search technology powered by language models. Engaging with data through natural language is becoming popular with advancements in AI. This will enable Snowflake users and application developers to build rich, search-enabled and conversational experiences. We believe Neeva will increase our opportunity to allow non-technical users to extract value from their data. More broadly, Snowflake continues to enable industries and workloads. In Q1, more than 800 customers engaged with Snowpark for the first time. Approximately 30% of all customers are now using Snowpark on at least a weekly basis, up from 20% at the end of last quarter. Snowpark consumption is up nearly 70% quarter-over-quarter. The Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow is in public preview. Customers can access ServiceNow data inside of the data cloud without needing to manually integrate APIs or third-party tools. ServiceNow data is significant, because it holds a wealth of IT and security data. The Connector is the first so-called native app built by Snowflake. Native apps, which are on Private Preview, run insight to Snowflake governance perimeter and make use of common services. Today, developers waste time convincing customers to expose their data. With native apps, developers can focus on their core interest, application development. They offload] (ph) security and deployment concerns to Snowflake. During the quarter, we also launched the Manufacturing Data Cloud, which focuses on supply chain management as a data problem. Supply chain management is one of the few remaining realms in enterprise software that have struggled the platform itself. Supply change are all somewhat unique and the data siloing problem prevents supply chain visibility essential to managing it. With the Manufacturing Cloud, Snowflake continues to evolve from being a data cloud to also being an operational hub for large enterprises and institution. We also announced that Blue Yonder, one of the largest software companies in supply chain management, will fully re-platform onto Snowflake. Blue Yonder is a key participant in both the manufacturing and the retail data clouds. They are the first major supply chain provider to make this commitment to creating the end-to-end supply chain platform on Snowflake. Supply chain management is a highly network discipline, as the change are typically comprised of numerous different entities. We, therefore, expect significant network effects from this strategic alliance with Blue Yonder. Our Summit conference in June will feature more significant product announcements and we look forward to seeing you there. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Scarpelli: Thank you, Frank. Q1 product revenues were $590 million, representing 50% year-over-year growth, and remaining performance obligations grew 31% year-over-year, totaling $3.4 billion. Of the $3.4 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 57% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. This represents a 40% increase compared to our estimate as of the same quarter last year. Our net revenue retention rate -- excuse me, of 151% includes five new customers with $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue. Q1 revenue reflects strong performance in a challenging environment. We continue to focus on growth and efficiency. We generated $287 million of non-GAAP adjusted of free cash flow, outperforming our Q1 target. In Q1, consumption varied from month to month. We benefited from strong consumption in February and March. Starting in April, consumption slowed after the Easter holidays through today. The strength in the quarter was driven by our healthcare and manufacturing customers. Financial services customers outperformed our expectations. From a geographic standpoint, we saw in line performance globally with the exception of our SMB and APJ segments. It is challenging to identify a single cause of the consumption slowdown between Easter and today. A few of our largest customers have scrutinized Snowflake costs, as they face headwinds in their own businesses. For example, some organizations have re-evaluated their data retention policies to delete stale and less valuable data. This lowers their storage bill and reduces compute cost. We've worked with a few large customers more recently on these efforts and expect these trends to continue. History has shown that price performance benefits long-term consumption. From a booking standpoint, we saw headwinds globally with the exception of our North American large enterprise segment. This is not due to competitive pressures, but because customers remain hesitant to sign large multi-year deals. Productivity is not where we want it to be and our updated outlook reflects this. Q1 is always a challenging bookings quarter and the current macro environment magnifies that. But we are still not satisfied with our results. We will only invest in areas that yield returns. For that reason, we will prioritize existing sales resources to drive growth before we onboard new capacity. Q1 represented another quarter of continued progress on profitability. Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 77%. More favorable pricing with our cloud service providers, product improvements, scale in our public cloud data centers, and continued growth in large customer accounts will contribute to year-over-year gross margin improvements. Non-GAAP operating margin was 5%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and savings on sales and marketing spend. Our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 46%, positively impacted by strong linearity of collections and some early collections of May receivables. We continue to have a strong cash position with $5 billion in cash, cash equivalent and short-term and long-term investments. We used approximately $192 million of our cash to repurchase approximately 1.4 million to date at an average price of $136. We will continue to opportunistically repurchase shares using our free cash flow. As Frank mentioned, we are acquiring Neeva. We are excited to welcome approximately 40 employees from Neeva to Snowflake, and the full impact is reflected in our outlook. Before turning to guidance, I would like to discuss the recent trends we've been observing. As I mentioned, we have seen slower-than-expected revenue growth since Easter. Contrary to last quarter, the majority of this underperformance is driven by older customers. Although we expect this to reverse, we are flowing these patterns through to the full year due to our lack of predictability and visibility of [customer behavior] (ph). As a result, we're reining in costs until we see a consistent change in consumption. We are still focused on investing in efficient growth with the concentration on continuing to sign new customers, ensuring these customers are migrated quickly and successfully, leveraging our PS team and partner resources, and selling our newer solutions such as Snowpark and Streamlit to win more personas in the enterprise. We are confident that this will ultimately lead to the data cloud network effects we have laid out over the past few years. We still believe we can achieve $10 billion of product revenue in fiscal 2029 with a better margin profile than we laid out last year. Now, let's turn to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect product revenues between $620 million and $625 million, representing year-over-year growth between 33% and 34%. Turning to margins, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, 2% operating margin. And we expect 361 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2024, we expect product revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 34%. Turning to profitability, for the full year fiscal 2024, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, approximately 76% product gross margin, 5% operating margin and 26% adjusted free cash flow margin. And we expect 362 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We will continue to prioritize hiring in product and engineering. We have slowed our hiring plan for the year, and we expect to add approximately 1,000 employees in fiscal 2024, inclusive of M&A. And lastly, we will host our Investor Day on June 27 in Las Vegas in conjunction with Snowflake Summit, our annual users conference. If you are interested in attending, please email IR@snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: I apologize for all the coughing.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. Frank, do you sense any connection to the cadence of hyperscaler cost optimization activity? In other words, if the AWS and Azure optimizations begin to normalize within a few quarters, do you think that Snowflake's consumption pattern then sequential growth rates would perk up around the same time, or do you look at this as a more separate kind of phenomena? Then I have a quick follow-up.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. Well, we think that because Amazon is such a large percentage of our overall deployments that they are good proxy, we just know from talking to them that what they experienced, we experienced as well. So, there's definitely a ripple effect because we're in the stack. So, the answer, generally speaking, is yes, we will see that. Microsoft is smaller. So, they're not as predictive of our experience as AWS would be.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Then as a quick follow-up, and Mike, I'm sorry to ask you questions. It sounds like you've got a bit of a cold. But is it safe to assume that you're completely through the revenue headwinds from Graviton adoption in the warehouse builder product? I think that's the case. But I'm also curious, are there any other analogous developments on the horizon that we could be thinking about that you might have baked into guidance in the next several quarters?\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. We've fully migrated all of our customers in AWS to Graviton 2, and that's the bulk of where our revenue is. And I want to remind you, there's really three types of optimizations. There's the optimizations by the cloud vendors and that's with better hardware, better performance. Then, there's the optimizations that we do regularly in our software, which improve performance and hence cheaper for our customers. And generally, those two combined, we forecast, so there's a 5% headwind every year to our revenue associated with those. And the third optimization is the one that we really saw in a few of our largest customers, with them just wanting to really change their storage retention policies. Like, one customer went from five to three years, and it's a massive petabytes and petabytes of data. And so, we lose that storage revenue. But on top of that, now your queries run quicker, because you're querying less amounts of data. And we are seeing more customers wanting to do that. And I spoke to some of the hyperscalers, I won't say which one, they confirm they're seeing retention policies change within their customers, wanting to archive more older data.\nMark Murphy: Yes, thank you, Mike. That's very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nKash Rangan: Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. If you could just offer to the degree that you can, what are your customers that are going through consumption optimization, telling you with respect to when that's likely to plateau and when they are likely to come back to \"normal consumption,\" if you can? Thank you so much.\nFrank Slootman: Yes, Kash, I would say, look, there's -- just to put a little bit more color on, there's optimization, which is just how do we run what we're already running more efficiently and driving a level of savings that way, but there's sort of another layer on top of that. I would call it rationalization. One of the things that we've seen happen over the last couple of quarters is that the CFO is in the business. And this is sort of an expression that we use in enterprise that they're selling is that there is a level of oversight scrutiny that's normally not there. And this is not a frequent occurrence. You only see this happening in fairly severe episodes. In the beginning it's like, \"Hey, we do smaller contracts, short-term contracts,\" but then it's like, \"Hey, you're going to live within your means. Here's the amount of money you're going to spend and you're going to make it work. And you can figure out where you're going to cut to fit into our box.\" So that's really dynamics that we've seen playing out there. Now in terms of your question, when is this all going to be over? These things do run their course, because, in the end, we're settling in. I said in my prepared remarks, things are unsettled, but eventually they will settle. We will settle into new patterns and then we sort of resume from there. But I think as of right now, I think things are still unsettled and people are adjusting, and that we don't have real strong visibility in terms of, \"Okay, when is it all going to be different?\"\nKash Rangan: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, gentlemen, for taking the question. Mike, this one's for you. And it might be a little unfair, but it's the one that I'm getting most from investors, and it's about kind of guidance methodology and if anything's changed in that. We've seen the forward forecast have to come down a couple of times over the past couple of quarters. And there's a lot of moving pieces in both the macro environment and kind of how your customers are acting. How can we give investors confidence that this is the last cut that we're not going to be running into new types of optimization on a go-forward basis and further taking down our forecast for the fiscal year?\nMike Scarpelli: Well, the way we -- there is no change in our forecast methodology and we forecast looking literally at consumption trends on a daily basis, literally four weeks prior to the earnings through yesterday. And what I would say was really unique. This, in the past, is we literally saw four weeks in April where there was no week-over-week growth per se or not material. And we do think that was driven a lot by some of these customers, that's when it happens, some of these big optimizations on storage retention policies. But in a consumption model, customers have the ability to dial it back and they can increase it as well too when they get more confidence in their business. And I can only guide based upon the data we have available to us.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Keith. Our next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. So, maybe one financial one, if we -- and then a technical one. If we look at the balance of the growth headwinds from optimization versus rationalization, or meaning how much people are doing less of versus still tight with the purse strings to do more with? Kind of how does that balance look? How has it changed over the course of the last six to nine months? And then maybe just from a technical perspective, what do you get with Neeva? Why is it important? What does it unlock for your customer base relative to generative AI?\nMike Scarpelli: So, in terms of what customers are doing actually the number of jobs -- the number of queries actually grew 57% year-over-year in the quarter, it's outpacing our revenue. The queries are just running more efficiently. And that is because of some of the optimizations, both -- if you reduce the amount of storage running queries on, they run faster. It's also the impact you're getting right now of the full Graviton 2 this year versus the quarter from last year. So the number of jobs is actually out -- growth is actually outpacing revenue and just we're becoming so much more efficient for our customers. And on the Neeva, we'll go to Christian, who is here can...\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes. So, hi, Christian here. The broad vision that we communicated to all of you over the last several years is Snowflake is on a mission to extend its capabilities, so we can bring computation to happen close to the data. It has evolved us into an application platform. And a core use case for applications is not only search and search enabled experiences, but with the advent of generative AI is the notion of conversational experiences. And the folks from Neeva are the ones that are going to power or help us accelerate the efforts around Snowflake as a platform for search and conversational experiences, but most important within the security perimeter of Snowflake with the customers' data so that they can leverage all this new innovation and technology, but with the safety on the privacy and security of the data.\nAlex Zukin: Understood.\nOperator: Our next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Thank you. Mike, I hope you feel better soon. The -- quick question. Last quarter, we talked about like the newer cohort kind of expanding slightly at the lower pace compared to the more established one -- the more older ones. Have you seen any change in momentum there? Or is it like -- if you think about it, like, we had the last quarter slower expansion from the newer ones, and now this quarter, we have like more optimization from the older ones. Is that like the two things or are there other kind of factors at work there?\nMike Scarpelli: No, good question. The newer ones are growing faster. The older, obviously, are the larger dollars. So, when they do optimizations that has a bigger impact. And it's interesting to the net revenue retention for growth within AWS, those customers are materially above where overall company is and that's because we're relatively new to that. So, the Azure Cloud is really starting to take off for us as well.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. And then one, maybe to help you with your voice, for Frank. But Frank, if you think about the changes in policy in terms of storage retention and stuff like that, I mean, there was a reason why people stored their data, like, for a certain number of years, et cetera. Do you think that what you're seeing now is kind of more a temporary thing? Or -- and as we're coming out, people just kind of do it, have a different approach, kind of do you think that's kind of the permanent move that's happening here? Thank you.\nFrank Slootman: I don't think it's permanent. Look, like I said, the CFOs in the business given very direct guidance in terms of \"Here's where you need to be,\" then the operating teams are starting to look at, \"Okay, how do we implement this?\" Sometimes the low-hanging fruit is, we'll just cut the data back. The processes might actually not be running as well, okay? So, there is actually cost. But you know what, the cost concern is prevailing at the moment because of the general sentiment that we are. In 2020 and 2021, there was -- it was growth at all costs and the mentality was let it rip. Now we're in the complete inverse of that situation. We know where we have strong certainty, predictability on cost and so on. I don't think that will last. We're just on the other side of the spectrum right now. And we will reconvert to the mean at some point here.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Mike, I know in a consumption model, obviously, it's difficult to predict the number of new workloads and transaction volumes, a lot of that we know is tied to macro. I just wanted to come back to the optimization topic. You talked about the three different types of optimization. Is there any way you can compare your total customer portfolio to the most optimized customer that you have just to get a sense of maybe what the downside is, if everyone were optimized as your most optimized customer?\nMike Scarpelli: That would be so hard to do. I don't have that data. Each customer is different.\nBrad Zelnick: Can I ask you a question right [Multiple Speakers] Please go ahead. Sorry.\nChristian Kleinerman: No, I was going to add that in certain instances, some of these optimizations in the third category that Mike described and what Frank was alluding to, it's changing how the business thinks about their needs. So, when we made the decision to re-evaluate our storage policy, there's a business impact that only customers can do, so it's difficult for us to estimate that type of decision.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you, Christian. It's helpful. Mike, a question I know you do have the answer to. Since you forecast the trends every week, any commentary on how May looks relative to April?\nMike Scarpelli: That's reflected in the guide that I gave you, the $2.6 billion for the year. I would say that there were a couple of periods in May where it was strong, but it's kind of -- it's okay. But it's not where we want it to be, but that's reflected in the guide now.\nBrad Zelnick: Cool. Thank you so much for taking the questions, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Your line is now open.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Thanks. Mike, if I could just build on Brad's line of questioning, the spirit of it is what assumptions you're embedding in your second half guidance? Are you essentially reflecting the April, May environment you saw and straight lining it, or are you taking a little bit more of a conservative approach and sort of haircutting that assumes that it or maybe the fins vertical gets a little bit weaker? That's question number one. Question number two, maybe this is best suited for Frank. Frank, Mike mentioned in his comments that sales productivity is not where Snowflake wanted it to be. Could you elaborate on that? Because that sounds like some of the pressure may not be entirely macro, but might be sales execution. So, I'd love to hear a little bit. If I interpreted that correctly? And, the steps you're taking maybe to turn it around? Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: So, sorry, Karl. We are expecting that there will be week-over-week growth on average with our customers that will compound, but it's at a much lower pace than it was prior, and it's more what we've been seeing in the last four weeks is what we're expecting inside there. I'm not expecting a straight line from where we are today at the end of the year.\nFrank Slootman: Yes. On the sales productivity side, I do think that's very much a macro thing. There comes a point where you can't push any harder. And we have applied the resources, but we're not converting on the resources in a way that we think is optimal. So, is there an execution aspect? There always is, right? I mean, that's just day-to-day sales management. But in all the years of doing this kind of work, I felt like I've always sort of under applied the resource. In hindsight, I thought that I always thought I could have done more. This is definitely a situation where I feel like we have applied tremendous amounts of resource and we've been very, very successful at it. But there comes a point where, okay, we need to become more selective, more prioritized on driving the performance. So, I definitely think it's a macro thing. I mean, the sentiment out there is of a sort that you just can't push us any harder than up to a certain point.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Walravens with JMP. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Walravens: [Technical Difficulty]\nMike Scarpelli: We can't hear you, Pat.\nPatrick Walravens: If I remember right, Blue Yonder is JDA, and as i2 and Manugistics. So, anything about why that's so interesting would be great.\nFrank Slootman: Look, I have a long-term fascination with supply chain management, because supply chain management has never been really platformed in terms of software, it's an email spreadsheet operation. It's incredibly inefficient and it's an incredibly high volume opportunity. And the reason that it couldn't be platformed is, first of all, each supply chain is different. So it's very hard to have a standard solution for something that is so variable. But secondly, is the data problem. If you can't establish visibility across all the entities that make up to supply chain, you stand no chance of solving that problem. So, the reason that I find it so interesting for Snowflake is that, look, all the entities in the supply chain will become Snowflake accounts, right? Because that's the way everybody will have visibility to everybody else. And we have a real fighting chance of solving it. Secondly, the processes that run-in supply chain management are extremely computationally intensive and they run in very, very high volume. And of course, Snowflake is ideally suited for taking on those kinds of workloads. So, I really think that's supply chain management will be the most network segment of all industries that we're operating in. And today, the most network segment that we're running in is financial services by far, but I think it will be overtaken by manufacturing and retail in the fullness of time. Because there's absolutely no penetration right there. These are unsolved problems very much in almost in the history of computing. That's how serious that is. So, fantastic historical opportunity for the technology to address.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kirk Materne with ISI. Your line is now open.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. Frank, with sort of the explosion in questions around AI over the last six months, do you think that buyers or executives are tying the opportunities with AI to the data yet? Meaning, I know conceptually, they might get that, but are any of your conversations with customers sort of starting to percolate because of AI and the need to get your data sorted out to take advantage of that? Or is -- are the most people still sort of in the discovery phase on that front? And then, Mike, can you just talk if Neeva impacts the op margin guidance for the full year at all? I was just kind of curious, you've mentioned savings, but margins are sort of flattish year-over-year. I was just kind of curious if that had any impact. Thanks, guys.\nFrank Slootman: It's Frank. Obviously, customers make the connection between data and the ability to take advantage of the large language models and the natural language interface and then all that kind of stuff, and that's already happening. And the services that are today available on Snowflake, they're also available in the AI space, you can already rig things together and make some interesting progress. But the thing is you need to have highly-curated, highly-optimized data. And then -- that is what we do at Snowflake to really power these models. You cannot just indiscriminately let these things loose on data that is -- that people don't understand in terms of its quality, and its definition, its lineage, and all these kinds of things. So, I think, we are in a really great place. And I said in the prepared remarks, data has a gravitational pull. So, we will attract tremendous demand for these type of workloads. And our strategy is to enable that to the maximum towards the extent possible.\nMike Scarpelli: And then with regards to Neeva, Kirk, that's fully baked into the guidance. They have a number of -- well, actually, all of their engineers are very senior engineers, and they're all based in the U.S. They're very expensive people, these people.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Frank, this concept of Snow for Everyone and having a simple chat like GPT UI in front of the Snowflake data bring it to the mass market, I mean how long do you think this takes to where you start to see that where it's -- we have you deployed internally, but I have to go to one person that's the power user? When do you think that, ultimately, we can start seeing that in everyone's desktop?\nFrank Slootman: Well, I think that the more -- I don't want to say simplistic, it might not be the direct characterization. But for example, running these things on top of, for example, Salesforce data in Snowflake, which is a very common thing, something that we're already doing internally is -- that's going to be available in the second half all over the place. And people will like it. I like it. I mean I prefer it much over using dashboards and things like that, because it just let me asks questions. But they're also relatively simplistic questions. And where it gets harder, when you start asking much, much harder questions, that's when you start finding the limits of these kind of technologies. So I think we're still sort of in the fun-and-games state of the development of this technology. And with the content generation side of this, this technology is fascinating and captivating for people. But asking really hard analytical questions that take people weeks and weeks or even months to figure out, that will take some workforce software to do that in a matter of seconds to be productive that way. So, we're sort of at the top of the hype cycle. The real work really starts now.\nBrent Thill: And then, Mike, you mentioned you're not effectively -- it doesn't sound like bringing on a lot of new capacity. There's still 183 job openings on your website. So, I guess what you're saying is you're freezing quota-carrying rep onboarding in the interim until you see that capacity? Or are you still bringing people on? How are you thinking about this trend?\nMike Scarpelli: In the sales organization, we're only doing backfills right now, and we will look at performance management and upgrading people. And we could reallocate heads from one region that's underperforming to another region, but no net new hires. Sorry.\nBrent Thill: Great. I hope you feel better.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes. Sorry.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. Thank you for taking the questions. You mentioned the change in data retention as a more prevalent form of optimization recently. What about the refresh rate? Are you seeing customers pull back on the frequency with which the data are updating?\nChristian Kleinerman: No. Christian here. We have not seen changes there. If anything, because of our cost model, the economics are fairly similar if people are updating more versus less frequently or reasonably similar, and we don't see changes in the patterns.\nGregg Moskowitz: All right. That's helpful. Thanks, Christian. And then just a follow-up on Neeva, I guess, either for you or for Frank. So, I think of the technology as fairly horizontal in terms of potential appeal. I'm just wondering if you think this can be an avenue to help land new enterprise customers going forward? And then, secondly, how much of a value add do you think that this can truly provide to the installed base? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: This is Frank. I'll go first. We view search and chat as really complete evolution under the influence of AI, of our relationship with data and how we interact with it. I think most of us remember, when search first became available, how that's just dramatically changed our relationship with data. I'm personally a search junky. I can't leave it alone. I find it incredibly empowering. But the problem with search has been, it matches own strength, it has zero context. It's not stateful. And now we have the technology to make search incredibly powerful, also to the point that when it can't find it, it can actually generate the code to answer the questions that are posted in search. So, this is incredibly important to basically what we said from the beginning, Snowflake is about mobilizing the world's data, and this is how we're going to do it. I mean search and chats are sort of morphing into a single natural language interface. But the other thing I would caution you, this is not at all about what the natural language interfaces. I mean, a lot of the intelligence that we're talking about is going to be manifested through the interfaces, not just through natural language.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Gregg. Our next question is from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Mike, I hate to pose this to you, but you're probably the best to answer it. Beyond the week-to-week usage patterns in the installed base, are there any other operational data metrics that you're looking at to give you confidence on when NRR will bottom?\nMike Scarpelli: We're -- obviously, that's not the only thing I'd look at. I look at pipeline generation, weighted pipeline. I'm typically looking out three to four quarters. I'm looking at -- I sit in on the sales call, every Monday. We're spending a lot of time with reps these days on what is going on within their accounts. And so -- but the most important thing is consumption patterns today are the biggest indicator of the future. And also looking at new products that may come out. It's hard to forecast anything for them, but that gives us somewhat of confidence. We have some big announcements that are going GA towards -- Streamlit it is one of them. We talked about Applica in Private Preview. But Streamlit, we think, will be meaningful. And we're really pleased with what we're seeing in the Snowpark daily credit consumption right now.\nBrad Reback: That's great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is now open.\nTyler Radke: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I'll pose this to Frank to give Mike a break there. But just on Microsoft, so obviously, they're hosting their Build conference this week and a ton of new product announcements, including in data and analytics. But I wanted to ask you more on the partnership front. I think you commented on just seeing some better traction there. I think they've evolved their partner program, including adding you as a Tier 1 partner. So, could you just talk about kind of the status of that relationship? How you're fitting in, given some of these announcements, like Fabric, which kind of unifying Microsoft's own products, but just the status quo on that relationship and the opportunity with this new partnership?\nFrank Slootman: Yes. Just Microsoft relationship has been growing faster than the other two cloud platforms that we support. It's been very clear from the top Microsoft that they're viewing Azure as a platform, not as a sort of a single integrated proprietary Microsoft stack. And they've said over and over that we're about choice, we're about innovation. And yes, we will compete, we will compete with Microsoft from day one, and that will -- and we've been very successful in that regard for a whole bunch of different reasons. But people keep on coming, and that's -- and we expect that. And I think that's sort of a net benefit for the world at large. As they get better and better products, then they get more choice. The good news is that I think the relationship is relatively mature, meaning that when there is friction or people who are not following the rules, we have good established processes for addressing and resolving that. And that's incredibly important, right, as we sort of get out of the juvenile state, where things are dysfunctional at the field level. So, I have no reason to believe that, that will not continue in that manner. So, I think Azure will continue to grow and grow faster than the other platforms.\nTyler Radke: Great. And on Snowpark, it sounded like that you're pleased with the consumption this quarter. Could you just give us a sense for expectations on the revenue ramp there? And what are the big use cases you're seeing today? Is it Hadoop migrations, data engineering? Just give us a sense on kind of how you're expecting that ramp up and what are the main use cases driving that?\nFrank Slootman: Yes. So here's the important thing to understand about Snowpark. Snowpark is the programmability platform for Snowflake. Now originally, I know Snowflake was conceived with SQL interfaces, and that was the mode through which you would address the platform. So this has really sort of opened up a whole host of modalities, if you will, onto the platform. Basically, our posture is, look, if it reads or writes to Snowflake, we want to own these processes. And Snowpark is the platform to achieve that. Now, the supply chain, if you will, how the data comes into Snowflake is through data engineering processes. Often these are Spark workloads and processes. We think they ought to run on Snowpark. And the reason is they're going to be cheaper, they're going to be faster, they're going to be operationally simpler, and they're going to be fully governed, right? So, we think if you are a Snowflake customer and you're not running these processes on Snowpark, you're just missing out in all those four dimensions that I just listed. On the consumption end, it's the same thing. If you're doing analytics, if you're doing data science, if you're doing machine learning, if you're doing AI, if it reads from and writes back to Snowflake, we think that's Snowpark. And we have taken a very emphatic posture to this. We're campaigning Snowpark very, very hard around the world. The interest is tremendously high. As I said in the prepared remarks, we went from 20% in one quarter to 30% of our customers using it on at least a weekly basis. We think that's going to go to 100%. I think Snowpark will become extremely prevalent around the use of Snowflake. Now beyond that, there's a whole wide world that we're obviously also very interested in, and we're going to start at home and own everything, that is there -- that we can own over there.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. Frank, maybe for you. I totally get the current cost concerns and optimization efforts underway. I'd be more curious to hear what you think could get us out of the current slowdown? Are there products or workloads that you would flag as the key ones to watch that drives the reacceleration of the business? Just thinking through what's in your control? Or do you think we have to wait to further macro to improve? Thanks.\nFrank Slootman: I guess, the number one issue is sentiment out there, just the lack of visibility, the anxiety. Watching CNBC all day doesn't give you any hope. That's absolutely number one. And -- because what we're seeing is that when we're dealing with CTOs and the Chief Data Officers, these people are chomping at the bit, but they are now literally getting stomped. As I said earlier, by the CFO being in the business and saying, well, I guess that's all good and well. But here's how much you're going to spend. You know you're going to get a new contract. You're going to live within the confines of the contract that you have. So really artificially constraining the demand because of the general anxiety that exists in the economy. So that really needs to start lifting. And that will happen. These things run their course. We've been through these episodes before. So I think that's really the requirement. There's plenty of demand out there, absolutely. And with AI right now, I mean, it's going to drive a whole other vector in terms of workload development. It's going to be hard to stop, CFOs or no CFO.\nBrent Bracelin: Very helpful there. And then, Christian, I wanted to follow up on Neeva. Streamlit, totally get that acquisition. Neeva, a little harder for me to fully understand. So, as you look at Neeva and the tech stack, what was most interesting? Was it the team? Is there some sort of differentiated search engine under the hood? Is it their large language model expertise? What -- why Neeva?\nChristian Kleinerman: Yes, it's a great question. I think it's the combination of traditional search technology with LLM technology. I think most of us have seen numerous demos of people that take an LLM in a couple of days or hours, produce something that looks good, but then there are problems on how precise that search is and how reliable those results are. Well, the Neeva team did extremely well. It was able to combine LLM and generative AI-type technology with traditional technology to be able to do attributional results. And it's very interesting in an enterprise setting where you want more precise answers. That combination was very appealing. And then, of course, it is a world-class team. And the combination of those two were appealing to us.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the competitive and the pricing environment out there. I guess on the competitive side, have you guys seen any change in win rates or workload shifts to different platforms? And when it comes to pricing, you talked about customers focusing a lot on cost savings. How is this translating into your ability to hold kind of unit pricing, especially on renewals?\nFrank Slootman: Frankly, I'll let Mike weigh in once he stops coughing. But the thing about pricing is, look, physics are physics, a read is a read, a write is a write. And there's economics. It costs a certain amount of money, right? And there's just not that much room other than playing games or temporarily sponsoring or subsidizing different parts of the business to really get a sustained pricing edge on one player or another. We're all converging to very, very similar economics. Where you see huge differences is in the total cost of ownership, and that is not the cost of computing and storage. And that is like, what is the cost to run that technology? And this is where [indiscernible] has a huge advantage. And our customers know that. It's just -- it's reduced skill sets, far fewer people, not having to touch the complexity of the underlying platforms, I mean, on and on and on. I mean, we're more descendants of Apple and Tesla than being a descendants of Hadoop, like some people are in the marketplace, right? So, we have really abstracted the complexity, and that's what generates this TCO advantage. But the raw cost of computing and storage, there's not that much opportunity to be [indiscernible].\nChristian Kleinerman: I want to add something to highlight what Frank mentioned in his Snowpark answer, which is what we're seeing relative to competitive platforms, Spark and by Spark, we're seeing Snowpark being only better performance, but better price performance. So, interestingly enough, we see customers giving us technical wins and wanting to migrate because of the better economics of the competitive dynamics.\nDerrick Wood: Great. And if I could squeeze one more in. Just in terms of LLMs, you guys are obviously sitting on a lot of data to be able to be mined and training models. Do you guys envision kind of building up GPU clusters and offering training and inference on your platform? Or do you think that's really the place for hyperscalers to be doing that?\nChristian Kleinerman: We're doing all of it. We alluded in the prepared remarks to Applica, which it is multi-model -- collection of models being built at Snowflake that requires GPUs. So, we're doing our part, but we're also working and we'll show more at our conference on how we surface GPU [indiscernible]. So all of the above, it's an important component of this gen AI wave of innovation.\nDerrick Wood: Okay. Thanks. Mike, feel better.\nMike Scarpelli: Thanks. I'm so sorry.\nOperator: Thank you, Derrick. Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Scotiabank. Our next question is from Sterling Auty with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nSterling Auty: Hi, thanks.\nMike Scarpelli: We're having a problem here.\nSterling Auty: Yes, sorry about that, Mike. It's hard to hear the operator.\nMike Scarpelli: Yes.\nSterling Auty: So just wondering, you've called out financial services as your largest vertical. Wondering how much of an impact that vertical had in the consumption patterns that you pointed out post the Easter holiday?\nMike Scarpelli: I guess, the financial services vertical is doing fine. It was very strong for us. It's still 23% of our revenue and growing quite fast. It was in some of the other areas with some of our bigger customers outside of financial services.\nSterling Auty: All right. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMike Scarpelli: Operator, we're having a hard time hearing you. Now, we hear you. Okay.\nMichael Turrin: No, the operator is fading. I would agree. I appreciate you sneaking me in. Just going back the revised guidance suggests growth falls below 30%, but you did mention confidence still in the longer-term $10 billion target. So, if we could just spend some time on what you're hearing from customers that drives confidence around what you're seeing is temporary which suggests growth bounces back? And as the second part, on the bookings commentary, it sounded like North America large enterprise is the area that's standing out favorably. I just want to make sure we have the right context there and if there's anything else you can add on what's driving that, it's appreciated. Thank you.\nMike Scarpelli: What I would say is we have a lot of customers. We have only moved a fraction of their data that we know they have multi-year plans to go on Snowflake, and that's what gives us the confidence as well as the pipeline of deals. And I'm not just talking to pipeline now. There's deals for next year that I know their long sales cycles, these big customers. That's what gives us the pipeline on top of a lot of the new products we have coming out over the next couple of years.\nMichael Turrin: Okay. Thanks [indiscernible] the callbacks. Thanks.\nOperator: That will be the last question. Thank you for your time and your participation. That concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jimmy. Welcome, everybody, listening to today's earnings announcement. Snowflake's product revenue grew 50% in Q1 fiscal year 2024 totaling $590 million. Our net revenue retention rate reached 151%, and remaining performance obligations came in at $3.4 billion, up 31% year-on-year. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow was $287 million, up 58% year-over-year. We are, however, operating in an unsettled demand environment and we see this reflected in consumption patterns across the board. While enthusiasm for Snowflake is high, enterprises are preoccupied with cost in response to their own uncertainties. We proactively work with customers to optimize their environments. This may well continue near term, but cycles like this eventually run their course. Our conviction in the long-term opportunity remains unchanged. Generative AI with its chat-style of interaction has captured the imagination of society at large. It will bring disruption, productivity, as well as obsolescence to tasks and the entire industries alike. Generative AI is powered by data. That's how models trained and become progressively more interesting and relevant. Models have been primarily been trained with Internet and public data and we believe enterprises will benefit from customizing this technology with their own data. As Snowflake manages a vast and growing universe of public and proprietary data, the data cloud's role in advancing this trend becomes pronounced. AI's focus on large language models and textual data, both structured and unstructured, will lead to rapid proliferation of model types and specializations. Some models will be broadly capable with shallow in functions, others will be deep, specialized and impactful in their specific realm. For years, we focused on the extensibility of our platform via Snowpark, making Snowflake ideally suited for a rapid adoption of new and interesting language models as they become available. AI is also not limited to textual data, equally far reaching will be seen with audio, video and other modalities. The Snowflake mission is to steadily demolish any and all limits to data, users, workloads, applications and new forms of intelligence. You will, therefore, continue to see us add, evolve and expand our functions and feature sets. Our goal is for all the world's data to find its way to Snowflake and not encounter any limitations in terms of use and purpose. From our perspective, machine learning, data science and AI are workloads that we enable with increased capability, continuous performance and efficiency improvements. Data has gravitational pull. And given the vast universe of data Snowflake already manages, it's no surprise that interest in these capabilities is escalating while its uses are still evolving. Data science, machine learning and AI use cases on Snowflake are growing every day. In Q1, more than 1,500 customers leveraged Snowflake for one of these workloads, up 91% year-over-year. A large U.S. financial institution uses Snowflake for model training. Facing memory constraints with their prior solution, they chose to move feature engineering workloads to Snowflake. With Snowflake, they can fully ingest all data, replacing a sampling approach, which left models less predictive and long running. Snowflake enables machine learning for a broad spectrum of user types, not just programmers. For analysts, we have introduced, in preview, ML-powered SQL extensions such as anomaly detection, top insights, and time series forecasting. SQL proficient users can now leverage powerful machine learning extensions without the need to master the underlying data science. For data scientists and engineers, Snowpark is our platform for programmability. New here is a PyTorch data loader and an MLFlow plugin, both in Private Preview. PyTorch is a popular framework for machine learning, and MLFlow helps manage the lifecycle and operations of machine learning. Snowflake had an early start in support of language models through last year's acquisition of Applica, now in Private Preview. Applica's language model solves a real business challenge, understanding unstructured data. Users can turn documents such as invoices or legal contracts into structured properties. These documents are now referenceable for analytics, data science and AI, something that is quite challenging in today's environment. Streamlit is the framework of choice for data scientists to create applications and experiences for AI and ML. Over 1,500 LLM-powered Streamlit apps have already been built. GPT Lab is one example. GPT Lab offers pre-trained AI assistance that can be shared across users. We announced our intent to acquire Neeva, a next-generation search technology powered by language models. Engaging with data through natural language is becoming popular with advancements in AI. This will enable Snowflake users and application developers to build rich, search-enabled and conversational experiences. We believe Neeva will increase our opportunity to allow non-technical users to extract value from their data. More broadly, Snowflake continues to enable industries and workloads. In Q1, more than 800 customers engaged with Snowpark for the first time. Approximately 30% of all customers are now using Snowpark on at least a weekly basis, up from 20% at the end of last quarter. Snowpark consumption is up nearly 70% quarter-over-quarter. The Snowflake Connector for ServiceNow is in public preview. Customers can access ServiceNow data inside of the data cloud without needing to manually integrate APIs or third-party tools. ServiceNow data is significant, because it holds a wealth of IT and security data. The Connector is the first so-called native app built by Snowflake. Native apps, which are on Private Preview, run insight to Snowflake governance perimeter and make use of common services. Today, developers waste time convincing customers to expose their data. With native apps, developers can focus on their core interest, application development. They offload] (ph) security and deployment concerns to Snowflake. During the quarter, we also launched the Manufacturing Data Cloud, which focuses on supply chain management as a data problem. Supply chain management is one of the few remaining realms in enterprise software that have struggled the platform itself. Supply change are all somewhat unique and the data siloing problem prevents supply chain visibility essential to managing it. With the Manufacturing Cloud, Snowflake continues to evolve from being a data cloud to also being an operational hub for large enterprises and institution. We also announced that Blue Yonder, one of the largest software companies in supply chain management, will fully re-platform onto Snowflake. Blue Yonder is a key participant in both the manufacturing and the retail data clouds. They are the first major supply chain provider to make this commitment to creating the end-to-end supply chain platform on Snowflake. Supply chain management is a highly network discipline, as the change are typically comprised of numerous different entities. We, therefore, expect significant network effects from this strategic alliance with Blue Yonder. Our Summit conference in June will feature more significant product announcements and we look forward to seeing you there. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Yes. Well, we think that because Amazon is such a large percentage of our overall deployments that they are good proxy, we just know from talking to them that what they experienced, we experienced as well. So, there's definitely a ripple effect because we're in the stack. So, the answer, generally speaking, is yes, we will see that. Microsoft is smaller. So, they're not as predictive of our experience as AWS would be. Yes, Kash, I would say, look, there's -- just to put a little bit more color on, there's optimization, which is just how do we run what we're already running more efficiently and driving a level of savings that way, but there's sort of another layer on top of that. I would call it rationalization. One of the things that we've seen happen over the last couple of quarters is that the CFO is in the business. And this is sort of an expression that we use in enterprise that they're selling is that there is a level of oversight scrutiny that's normally not there. And this is not a frequent occurrence. You only see this happening in fairly severe episodes. In the beginning it's like, \"Hey, we do smaller contracts, short-term contracts,\" but then it's like, \"Hey, you're going to live within your means. Here's the amount of money you're going to spend and you're going to make it work. And you can figure out where you're going to cut to fit into our box.\" So that's really dynamics that we've seen playing out there. Now in terms of your question, when is this all going to be over? These things do run their course, because, in the end, we're settling in. I said in my prepared remarks, things are unsettled, but eventually they will settle. We will settle into new patterns and then we sort of resume from there. But I think as of right now, I think things are still unsettled and people are adjusting, and that we don't have real strong visibility in terms of, \"Okay, when is it all going to be different?\" I don't think it's permanent. Look, like I said, the CFOs in the business given very direct guidance in terms of \"Here's where you need to be,\" then the operating teams are starting to look at, \"Okay, how do we implement this?\" Sometimes the low-hanging fruit is, we'll just cut the data back. The processes might actually not be running as well, okay? So, there is actually cost. But you know what, the cost concern is prevailing at the moment because of the general sentiment that we are. In 2020 and 2021, there was -- it was growth at all costs and the mentality was let it rip. Now we're in the complete inverse of that situation. We know where we have strong certainty, predictability on cost and so on. I don't think that will last. We're just on the other side of the spectrum right now. And we will reconvert to the mean at some point here. Yes. On the sales productivity side, I do think that's very much a macro thing. There comes a point where you can't push any harder. And we have applied the resources, but we're not converting on the resources in a way that we think is optimal. So, is there an execution aspect? There always is, right? I mean, that's just day-to-day sales management. But in all the years of doing this kind of work, I felt like I've always sort of under applied the resource. In hindsight, I thought that I always thought I could have done more. This is definitely a situation where I feel like we have applied tremendous amounts of resource and we've been very, very successful at it. But there comes a point where, okay, we need to become more selective, more prioritized on driving the performance. So, I definitely think it's a macro thing. I mean, the sentiment out there is of a sort that you just can't push us any harder than up to a certain point. Look, I have a long-term fascination with supply chain management, because supply chain management has never been really platformed in terms of software, it's an email spreadsheet operation. It's incredibly inefficient and it's an incredibly high volume opportunity. And the reason that it couldn't be platformed is, first of all, each supply chain is different. So it's very hard to have a standard solution for something that is so variable. But secondly, is the data problem. If you can't establish visibility across all the entities that make up to supply chain, you stand no chance of solving that problem. So, the reason that I find it so interesting for Snowflake is that, look, all the entities in the supply chain will become Snowflake accounts, right? Because that's the way everybody will have visibility to everybody else. And we have a real fighting chance of solving it. Secondly, the processes that run-in supply chain management are extremely computationally intensive and they run in very, very high volume. And of course, Snowflake is ideally suited for taking on those kinds of workloads. So, I really think that's supply chain management will be the most network segment of all industries that we're operating in. And today, the most network segment that we're running in is financial services by far, but I think it will be overtaken by manufacturing and retail in the fullness of time. Because there's absolutely no penetration right there. These are unsolved problems very much in almost in the history of computing. That's how serious that is. So, fantastic historical opportunity for the technology to address. It's Frank. Obviously, customers make the connection between data and the ability to take advantage of the large language models and the natural language interface and then all that kind of stuff, and that's already happening. And the services that are today available on Snowflake, they're also available in the AI space, you can already rig things together and make some interesting progress. But the thing is you need to have highly-curated, highly-optimized data. And then -- that is what we do at Snowflake to really power these models. You cannot just indiscriminately let these things loose on data that is -- that people don't understand in terms of its quality, and its definition, its lineage, and all these kinds of things. So, I think, we are in a really great place. And I said in the prepared remarks, data has a gravitational pull. So, we will attract tremendous demand for these type of workloads. And our strategy is to enable that to the maximum towards the extent possible. Well, I think that the more -- I don't want to say simplistic, it might not be the direct characterization. But for example, running these things on top of, for example, Salesforce data in Snowflake, which is a very common thing, something that we're already doing internally is -- that's going to be available in the second half all over the place. And people will like it. I like it. I mean I prefer it much over using dashboards and things like that, because it just let me asks questions. But they're also relatively simplistic questions. And where it gets harder, when you start asking much, much harder questions, that's when you start finding the limits of these kind of technologies. So I think we're still sort of in the fun-and-games state of the development of this technology. And with the content generation side of this, this technology is fascinating and captivating for people. But asking really hard analytical questions that take people weeks and weeks or even months to figure out, that will take some workforce software to do that in a matter of seconds to be productive that way. So, we're sort of at the top of the hype cycle. The real work really starts now. This is Frank. I'll go first. We view search and chat as really complete evolution under the influence of AI, of our relationship with data and how we interact with it. I think most of us remember, when search first became available, how that's just dramatically changed our relationship with data. I'm personally a search junky. I can't leave it alone. I find it incredibly empowering. But the problem with search has been, it matches own strength, it has zero context. It's not stateful. And now we have the technology to make search incredibly powerful, also to the point that when it can't find it, it can actually generate the code to answer the questions that are posted in search. So, this is incredibly important to basically what we said from the beginning, Snowflake is about mobilizing the world's data, and this is how we're going to do it. I mean search and chats are sort of morphing into a single natural language interface. But the other thing I would caution you, this is not at all about what the natural language interfaces. I mean, a lot of the intelligence that we're talking about is going to be manifested through the interfaces, not just through natural language. Yes. Just Microsoft relationship has been growing faster than the other two cloud platforms that we support. It's been very clear from the top Microsoft that they're viewing Azure as a platform, not as a sort of a single integrated proprietary Microsoft stack. And they've said over and over that we're about choice, we're about innovation. And yes, we will compete, we will compete with Microsoft from day one, and that will -- and we've been very successful in that regard for a whole bunch of different reasons. But people keep on coming, and that's -- and we expect that. And I think that's sort of a net benefit for the world at large. As they get better and better products, then they get more choice. The good news is that I think the relationship is relatively mature, meaning that when there is friction or people who are not following the rules, we have good established processes for addressing and resolving that. And that's incredibly important, right, as we sort of get out of the juvenile state, where things are dysfunctional at the field level. So, I have no reason to believe that, that will not continue in that manner. So, I think Azure will continue to grow and grow faster than the other platforms. Yes. So here's the important thing to understand about Snowpark. Snowpark is the programmability platform for Snowflake. Now originally, I know Snowflake was conceived with SQL interfaces, and that was the mode through which you would address the platform. So this has really sort of opened up a whole host of modalities, if you will, onto the platform. Basically, our posture is, look, if it reads or writes to Snowflake, we want to own these processes. And Snowpark is the platform to achieve that. Now, the supply chain, if you will, how the data comes into Snowflake is through data engineering processes. Often these are Spark workloads and processes. We think they ought to run on Snowpark. And the reason is they're going to be cheaper, they're going to be faster, they're going to be operationally simpler, and they're going to be fully governed, right? So, we think if you are a Snowflake customer and you're not running these processes on Snowpark, you're just missing out in all those four dimensions that I just listed. On the consumption end, it's the same thing. If you're doing analytics, if you're doing data science, if you're doing machine learning, if you're doing AI, if it reads from and writes back to Snowflake, we think that's Snowpark. And we have taken a very emphatic posture to this. We're campaigning Snowpark very, very hard around the world. The interest is tremendously high. As I said in the prepared remarks, we went from 20% in one quarter to 30% of our customers using it on at least a weekly basis. We think that's going to go to 100%. I think Snowpark will become extremely prevalent around the use of Snowflake. Now beyond that, there's a whole wide world that we're obviously also very interested in, and we're going to start at home and own everything, that is there -- that we can own over there. I guess, the number one issue is sentiment out there, just the lack of visibility, the anxiety. Watching CNBC all day doesn't give you any hope. That's absolutely number one. And -- because what we're seeing is that when we're dealing with CTOs and the Chief Data Officers, these people are chomping at the bit, but they are now literally getting stomped. As I said earlier, by the CFO being in the business and saying, well, I guess that's all good and well. But here's how much you're going to spend. You know you're going to get a new contract. You're going to live within the confines of the contract that you have. So really artificially constraining the demand because of the general anxiety that exists in the economy. So that really needs to start lifting. And that will happen. These things run their course. We've been through these episodes before. So I think that's really the requirement. There's plenty of demand out there, absolutely. And with AI right now, I mean, it's going to drive a whole other vector in terms of workload development. It's going to be hard to stop, CFOs or no CFO. Frankly, I'll let Mike weigh in once he stops coughing. But the thing about pricing is, look, physics are physics, a read is a read, a write is a write. And there's economics. It costs a certain amount of money, right? And there's just not that much room other than playing games or temporarily sponsoring or subsidizing different parts of the business to really get a sustained pricing edge on one player or another. We're all converging to very, very similar economics. Where you see huge differences is in the total cost of ownership, and that is not the cost of computing and storage. And that is like, what is the cost to run that technology? And this is where [indiscernible] has a huge advantage. And our customers know that. It's just -- it's reduced skill sets, far fewer people, not having to touch the complexity of the underlying platforms, I mean, on and on and on. I mean, we're more descendants of Apple and Tesla than being a descendants of Hadoop, like some people are in the marketplace, right? So, we have really abstracted the complexity, and that's what generates this TCO advantage. But the raw cost of computing and storage, there's not that much opportunity to be [indiscernible]."

            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Q1 product revenues were $590 million, representing 50% year-over-year growth, and remaining performance obligations grew 31% year-over-year, totaling $3.4 billion. Of the $3.4 billion in RPO, we expect approximately 57% to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. This represents a 40% increase compared to our estimate as of the same quarter last year. Our net revenue retention rate -- excuse me, of 151% includes five new customers with $1 million in trailing 12-month product revenue. Q1 revenue reflects strong performance in a challenging environment. We continue to focus on growth and efficiency. We generated $287 million of non-GAAP adjusted of free cash flow, outperforming our Q1 target. In Q1, consumption varied from month to month. We benefited from strong consumption in February and March. Starting in April, consumption slowed after the Easter holidays through today. The strength in the quarter was driven by our healthcare and manufacturing customers. Financial services customers outperformed our expectations. From a geographic standpoint, we saw in line performance globally with the exception of our SMB and APJ segments. It is challenging to identify a single cause of the consumption slowdown between Easter and today. A few of our largest customers have scrutinized Snowflake costs, as they face headwinds in their own businesses. For example, some organizations have re-evaluated their data retention policies to delete stale and less valuable data. This lowers their storage bill and reduces compute cost. We've worked with a few large customers more recently on these efforts and expect these trends to continue. History has shown that price performance benefits long-term consumption. From a booking standpoint, we saw headwinds globally with the exception of our North American large enterprise segment. This is not due to competitive pressures, but because customers remain hesitant to sign large multi-year deals. Productivity is not where we want it to be and our updated outlook reflects this. Q1 is always a challenging bookings quarter and the current macro environment magnifies that. But we are still not satisfied with our results. We will only invest in areas that yield returns. For that reason, we will prioritize existing sales resources to drive growth before we onboard new capacity. Q1 represented another quarter of continued progress on profitability. Our non-GAAP product gross margin was 77%. More favorable pricing with our cloud service providers, product improvements, scale in our public cloud data centers, and continued growth in large customer accounts will contribute to year-over-year gross margin improvements. Non-GAAP operating margin was 5%, benefiting from revenue outperformance and savings on sales and marketing spend. Our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 46%, positively impacted by strong linearity of collections and some early collections of May receivables. We continue to have a strong cash position with $5 billion in cash, cash equivalent and short-term and long-term investments. We used approximately $192 million of our cash to repurchase approximately 1.4 million to date at an average price of $136. We will continue to opportunistically repurchase shares using our free cash flow. As Frank mentioned, we are acquiring Neeva. We are excited to welcome approximately 40 employees from Neeva to Snowflake, and the full impact is reflected in our outlook. Before turning to guidance, I would like to discuss the recent trends we've been observing. As I mentioned, we have seen slower-than-expected revenue growth since Easter. Contrary to last quarter, the majority of this underperformance is driven by older customers. Although we expect this to reverse, we are flowing these patterns through to the full year due to our lack of predictability and visibility of [customer behavior] (ph). As a result, we're reining in costs until we see a consistent change in consumption. We are still focused on investing in efficient growth with the concentration on continuing to sign new customers, ensuring these customers are migrated quickly and successfully, leveraging our PS team and partner resources, and selling our newer solutions such as Snowpark and Streamlit to win more personas in the enterprise. We are confident that this will ultimately lead to the data cloud network effects we have laid out over the past few years. We still believe we can achieve $10 billion of product revenue in fiscal 2029 with a better margin profile than we laid out last year. Now, let's turn to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect product revenues between $620 million and $625 million, representing year-over-year growth between 33% and 34%. Turning to margins, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, 2% operating margin. And we expect 361 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2024, we expect product revenues of approximately $2.6 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 34%. Turning to profitability, for the full year fiscal 2024, we expect, on a non-GAAP basis, approximately 76% product gross margin, 5% operating margin and 26% adjusted free cash flow margin. And we expect 362 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. We will continue to prioritize hiring in product and engineering. We have slowed our hiring plan for the year, and we expect to add approximately 1,000 employees in fiscal 2024, inclusive of M&A. And lastly, we will host our Investor Day on June 27 in Las Vegas in conjunction with Snowflake Summit, our annual users conference. If you are interested in attending, please email IR@snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. I apologize for all the coughing. Yes. We've fully migrated all of our customers in AWS to Graviton 2, and that's the bulk of where our revenue is. And I want to remind you, there's really three types of optimizations. There's the optimizations by the cloud vendors and that's with better hardware, better performance. Then, there's the optimizations that we do regularly in our software, which improve performance and hence cheaper for our customers. And generally, those two combined, we forecast, so there's a 5% headwind every year to our revenue associated with those. And the third optimization is the one that we really saw in a few of our largest customers, with them just wanting to really change their storage retention policies. Like, one customer went from five to three years, and it's a massive petabytes and petabytes of data. And so, we lose that storage revenue. But on top of that, now your queries run quicker, because you're querying less amounts of data. And we are seeing more customers wanting to do that. And I spoke to some of the hyperscalers, I won't say which one, they confirm they're seeing retention policies change within their customers, wanting to archive more older data. Well, the way we -- there is no change in our forecast methodology and we forecast looking literally at consumption trends on a daily basis, literally four weeks prior to the earnings through yesterday. And what I would say was really unique. This, in the past, is we literally saw four weeks in April where there was no week-over-week growth per se or not material. And we do think that was driven a lot by some of these customers, that's when it happens, some of these big optimizations on storage retention policies. But in a consumption model, customers have the ability to dial it back and they can increase it as well too when they get more confidence in their business. And I can only guide based upon the data we have available to us. So, in terms of what customers are doing actually the number of jobs -- the number of queries actually grew 57% year-over-year in the quarter, it's outpacing our revenue. The queries are just running more efficiently. And that is because of some of the optimizations, both -- if you reduce the amount of storage running queries on, they run faster. It's also the impact you're getting right now of the full Graviton 2 this year versus the quarter from last year. So the number of jobs is actually out -- growth is actually outpacing revenue and just we're becoming so much more efficient for our customers. And on the Neeva, we'll go to Christian, who is here can... No, good question. The newer ones are growing faster. The older, obviously, are the larger dollars. So, when they do optimizations that has a bigger impact. And it's interesting to the net revenue retention for growth within AWS, those customers are materially above where overall company is and that's because we're relatively new to that. So, the Azure Cloud is really starting to take off for us as well. That would be so hard to do. I don't have that data. Each customer is different. That's reflected in the guide that I gave you, the $2.6 billion for the year. I would say that there were a couple of periods in May where it was strong, but it's kind of -- it's okay. But it's not where we want it to be, but that's reflected in the guide now. So, sorry, Karl. We are expecting that there will be week-over-week growth on average with our customers that will compound, but it's at a much lower pace than it was prior, and it's more what we've been seeing in the last four weeks is what we're expecting inside there. I'm not expecting a straight line from where we are today at the end of the year. We can't hear you, Pat. And then with regards to Neeva, Kirk, that's fully baked into the guidance. They have a number of -- well, actually, all of their engineers are very senior engineers, and they're all based in the U.S. They're very expensive people, these people. In the sales organization, we're only doing backfills right now, and we will look at performance management and upgrading people. And we could reallocate heads from one region that's underperforming to another region, but no net new hires. Sorry. Yes. Sorry. We're -- obviously, that's not the only thing I'd look at. I look at pipeline generation, weighted pipeline. I'm typically looking out three to four quarters. I'm looking at -- I sit in on the sales call, every Monday. We're spending a lot of time with reps these days on what is going on within their accounts. And so -- but the most important thing is consumption patterns today are the biggest indicator of the future. And also looking at new products that may come out. It's hard to forecast anything for them, but that gives us somewhat of confidence. We have some big announcements that are going GA towards -- Streamlit it is one of them. We talked about Applica in Private Preview. But Streamlit, we think, will be meaningful. And we're really pleased with what we're seeing in the Snowpark daily credit consumption right now. Thanks. I'm so sorry. We're having a problem here. Yes. I guess, the financial services vertical is doing fine. It was very strong for us. It's still 23% of our revenue and growing quite fast. It was in some of the other areas with some of our bigger customers outside of financial services. Operator, we're having a hard time hearing you. Now, we hear you. Okay. What I would say is we have a lot of customers. We have only moved a fraction of their data that we know they have multi-year plans to go on Snowflake, and that's what gives us the confidence as well as the pipeline of deals. And I'm not just talking to pipeline now. There's deals for next year that I know their long sales cycles, these big customers. That's what gives us the pipeline on top of a lot of the new products we have coming out over the next couple of years."
