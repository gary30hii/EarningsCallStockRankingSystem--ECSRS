The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.\nShawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m on the line with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include, but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic\u2019s severity and duration, healthcare insurer, government and client payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic\u2019s impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope, and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, which are drivers beyond the company\u2019s knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. References to base testing volumes or base business refer to testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compounded annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. So, in the year dominated by the pandemic, Quest brought critical COVID-19 testing to our country, and delivered record revenues, earnings, and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2020. The pandemic has tested our nearly 50,000 employees and they have responded as heroes, by developing COVID-19 tests, building test capacity, innovating new testing models with our retail partners, transporting specimens, delivering results, and of course, supporting our customers.\nMark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $3 billion, up nearly 56% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew approximately 58%, compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services, offset by a modest decline in our base testing revenue. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 26.8% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing 4.5%. As we highlighted in our 2020 outlook update in mid-December, organic testing volumes ordered in our base business were down mid-to-high single digits versus the prior year in October and November. The recovery stalled in late November with organic testing volume trends down high-single-digits versus the prior year in December due to the surge in new infections across the country.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. Well to summarize, I\u2019d like to thank all Quest employees who have worked tirelessly over the past year. They have delivered a significant portion of the country\u2019s COVID-19 testing, while serving the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. Thanks to their heroic efforts, we delivered record revenues, earnings, and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2020. In light of the company\u2019s strong financial performance, we have increased our dividend and share repurchase authorization while maintaining flexibility to pursue our M&A strategy. We look forward to sharing a more in-depth update on our market views and strategy at our upcoming virtual Investor Day to be held on Thursday, March 11. Stay tuned for additional details on that day. Now, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you.  And our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. I guess \u2013 I think I heard you say that you expected molecular reimbursement to trend lower, just wanted to flesh that out to understand that and maybe what have you seen for reimbursement with PHE likely extended for the full-year? And has there been any discussion or thoughts about proactively go into plans and perhaps not continuing to get that sort of inflated PHE reimbursement in exchange maybe for more favorable longer-term pricing escalators? Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to start it?\nMark Guinan: Sure. So, you know, we are expecting, you know, to still do quite well in terms of reimbursement in the near term. We believe we can meet the turnaround times, certainly the threshold that's required to be eligible for the higher rates, and then we get paid, obviously, based on the individual tests.  So, you know, we're still thinking in the near term that our average weighted reimbursement is going to be pretty strong, but we also recognize the reality, you know, the pressure on the industry, from all the various payers, especially the commercial payers, and so therefore, as we mentioned, you know, throughout the first half of the year, we would expect, you know, some reduction in that reimbursement, not something, you know, that would be momentous, but certainly some downward pressure. And as we said, the client area is very, very competitive. So there's, you know, quite a few labs at this point, given the demand that have significant capacity. And so therefore, in the  it\u2019s very, very competitive. You know, in terms of your questions, I'm sure you can appreciate Ralph that first off, we don't feel we're getting paid excessively for COVID PCR, and we feel like we're being paid appropriately. But even if you could exactly forecast the volume of our COVID testing, and forecast the base business, you know, over a period of time, which obviously would be nearly impossible, you know, I'm not sure that we need to trade off anything.  We're very happy with the relationships that we built, as Steve mentioned, with the payers, we've moved away from a focus on price and move toward more of a partnership and a, you know, alignment around value creation, where, you know, they're looking for us to save the money and create value and big piece of that is moving more work to us because we're already \u2013 they're very, you know, high value compared to the rest of the industry and, you know, possible choices for patients. So, you know, good question, Ralph, certainly appreciate it, but for practical and for strategic reasons, because of where we think we are with the payers already with some of these new contracts, certainly not something that we're looking to pursue right now.\nSteve Rusckowski: Let me just add to that. Speaking to demand,  shares that over the course of the last 10 months, we've brought up our capacity considerably, and we're going to continue to build it. And the reason for that is, we want to continue to be prepared in the event that we do have another surge. And then secondly is, we want to make sure we really have a capability to meet turnaround times that are expected in the market.  And over the last 10 months, obviously, a lot of retesting has been for the clinical purpose and what we believe as we entered the second half, and we're having many discussions in this regard, there's going to be a lot more demand for return to work programs with employers, which have been pushed out, as you all know, return to leisure activities, there's a number of cities that have large tourism bases that are thinking about what they need to do to get people back into those venues.  And there will be a lot of activity around just return to life. And I know that we are still trying to figure that out. And that's going to offer us a lot of opportunity in the future. And with that, there's always a COVID test, but there's also a number of services we provide, and those are yet to be defined. So, we're still trying to understand what that second half opportunity would be. But what we see so far, we will continue to have strong demand, but it may take a different form as we get into the second half and as we go into 22. Thanks, Ralph.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thank you.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nJustin Bowers : Hey, good morning. This is Justin Bowers on for Pito. Just with respect to the guide, can you kind of frame the high-end and the low-end for us in terms of your testing assumptions, and then also the through process on the increase in serology testing through the quarter?\nMark Guinan: Yeah. Sure Justin. So, you know it's multivariable. So there's several ways you could come to the high and low-end. So, what I would say is, you know, they're all based on the three major drivers with most of it being on the base volume recovery, and the level of PCR, you know, volume to lesser extent, serology. So, you know, if we don't see a significant fall off from where we stand today, in PCR, or if it, you know, surges up again, you know, because of these variants, or some other unknown factors, certainly that would take us, you know, to the higher-end combined with, you know, if the base business also were to continue to recover and not, you know, go the opposite direction as COVID surged again.  So, there is some negative correlation, obviously, between the two. But if they both move in the same direction, that would move us to the higher-end. And then if for some reason COVID fell off markedly, even more than we're planning, and as we talked about, we are planning for a decline over time in the first six months, as that midpoint, and the base business did not show recovery, or even, you know, potentially take a little bit of step back for economic or other reasons.  And that would take you to the low end, but you know, I can't at this point, provide exact, you know, changes in the base and COVID, because, obviously, there's multiple ways to get to either one, but directionally that's what, you know,  that our guidance with the midpoint being, as I said, you know, a modest recovery, but not full for the first six months of the base business. And then some step off, but still significant COVID testing for the first six months with the second quarter being, you know, markedly lower than the first quarter.\nJustin Bowers: Okay, got it. And then just to clarify the earlier comments, it sounded like the base business right now is kind of running stable month-over-month from December levels, are we interpreting that correctly? And then, just in terms of the molecular tests, reported on the website at, you know, 32.8 million is that the right number, look like kind of a huge step-up from February to January, but more importantly is that kind of where you guys are now for total molecular? And I'll hop back in queue. Thank you.\nMark Guinan: Sure. Steve, do you want to take that or would you like me to.\nSteve Rusckowski: Well let me \u2013 the step-up is, you know the step-up that we've seen based on the strong delivery that we had in the fourth quarter in the beginning of January. So, we are \u2013 as I said in my introductory comments, you know, we are one of the leading providers of COVID-19 testing. Second is, it does not include serology and did ask a question about serology, because we do believe there'll be an increasing role of serology throughout 2021. We seem to see some early indications that there's interest in understanding whether you have the antibodies or not, which might inform patients and physicians around, you know, their urgency of getting vaccinated. And at the same time, we're bringing out a new capability called  testing, and this will allow physicians and patients to see if in fact, they do get the spike protein from the vaccines. And we'll be bringing that out at platforms in the next few weeks. And you know, this can help us, you know, determining the vaccine is being effective.  So, we do believe that there will be some increased demands for serology, and this is on top of what we already do. And serology is providing a really important role for management of the disease, overall surveillance, epidemiology, and in measuring the response of what's happening pre and post-vaccinations and broad population. So, we believe there's an opportunity in front of us in 2021 in that regard.\nShawn Bevec: And Justin, just to close out on your other question, yes, 32.8 million was the total through as of Monday, and that was up 1.8 million over the prior two weeks. So, about 130,000 a day in the prior two weeks. Operate our next question.\nOperator: Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Hey, good morning. Steve, you mentioned the focus of the new administration on COVID testing, can you talk about how you think Quest role might change at all, serving the pandemic? And if we start to see greater adoption of home testing, how do you think Quest is going to be positioned for that?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah, so I think, you know, the new administration is leveraging what we've done in the past as a country and as an industry, and taking it to the next level. I mean, you see the capacity that's out there around the country. Back a few weeks ago, we were doing about 2 million COVID-19 molecular tests. So, obviously up considerably from where we all started last March. But going forward, Jack, I do see that there'll be a change beyond the PCR test. As I mentioned earlier, now there's going to be a greater demand, you know, for programs that get to portions of the population that help us get back to work, back to leisure activities, get back to life. And so, we're having a number of dialogues around that. And that will include the role of antigen testing, and more rapid testing workflows that allow us to see if the fact a person that wants to engage in whatever the activity is, is negative and safe for a reasonable period of time to participate. So, when we get into that world, you know we\u2019ll obviously be providing the testing, but as I said earlier, there's a number of services, and also IT solutions that you need to provide. And, like so much in healthcare, you see one, but we're currently engaged with a number of organizations, a number of municipalities, and a number of corporations, and what they will be doing in this regard, particularly in the second half.  I think, you know, the first quarter is outlined in our guidance  start to see improvement as we get into the second quarter. I think the second quarter will be a telling quarter for us all. And we do see a lot of people getting prepared for, you know, better infection rates, you know, better position for populations to get back to work life and leisure activities, and we're going to start to see more of that and Quest has a significant role in helping in that regard.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then just to follow up, I have a two-parter on unit pricing. I was curious if you could weigh in, do you have any notable commercial contract renewals in 2021? And then maybe more broadly, as you have discussions with commercial payers now, you know, do you feel like you have a little more of a, you know good footing you know in terms of negotiating price given, you know, the role the labs have served, you know, amidst the pandemic?\nSteve Rusckowski: You know, let me start with where you ended, I think our relationship with health plans has never been better. As you've seen over the last number of years, we've increased our presence, we have the best access to lives now that we've had in over a decade. And so, we are in a very strong footing. And also, during the pandemic I\u2019ll share that we were deeply engaged with many of the plans of what they needed to take care of their membership, and also their employees. So, the relationship is continued to strengthen. And as I said, in my introductory remarks, and Mark said, as well, we're shifting the dialogue away from exclusively price to the value we deliver. And when you go back to what we talked about in the past around what we bring to the table in terms of our value proposition around quality, our service performance, our innovation, all at a very affordable price, we believe our value proposition is really second to none. And as I said, you know in the course of the last year, we've done service, look at our reputation in the industry and net promoter scores, and those are quite strong. So, when you bring those facts to the table Jack, our position in terms of working out, the forward-looking relationships has, you know, provided a much stronger foundation, and a better understanding on the other side that we really do deliver a lot more value. So, we're in a good position with our plans. We\u2019re in good position with our contracts. We obviously don't provide specific details, but we feel very good about that. And also, I shared that we continue to make progress with our united relationship with a preferred lab network and the building relationship with Anthem were quite encouraged about as well. So, we feel good about a relationship and the progress we've made, but also the opportunities in front of us to continue to build on what we've been talking about. So, Mark anything you could like to add there?\nMark Guinan: Sure. So Jack, I understand the question and several years ago, I think there was an expectation where, you know people holding their breath, every time we extended a contract with a major payer because it would imply some sort of major price concession. I can tell you, you know, this has become largely invisible to you all, you know unless we talk about it like Anthem, which was really a new contract and brought together a number of states under a single contract, as opposed to having, you know different periods of time in which we were negotiating across the Anthem network. We just extended with a major commercial payer. You didn't hear about it, because there was no price concession. And in fact, we made huge headway with this payer. And, you know, getting them to acknowledge that in the world of PAMA, the whole notion of a discount to the CMS NLA rates no longer will apply going forward. And that, in fact, you know, CMS will be setting the market and that they should feel confident, is a market rate that they can feel comfortable and represent to their prospective or current members.  So, you know, really that's what it's been about, as they all want to make sure that they can say, they've got good prices. And now you've got an external benchmark, you can look to. So, we just extended with a very large national. We do have one coming up this year. But I can assure you that it's not going to be \u2013 it will not come with a major price concessions, you know, we're going to continue to work on the value-based contracting and with that actually comes good pricing that we feel, you know, represents the market, and then these come with upside, whereas we performed, you know, we both share in the benefit of that upside. That's the way we're really contracting in the last couple years and how we would expect to contract going forward.\nJack Meehan: Nice, Thanks, everyone.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.\nAdam Noble: Great, thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Kevin. I just wanted to, I guess double back to your comments around reimbursement for COVID PCR, you know wanted just to confirm that you're assuming throughout the first half, that the PHE is extended so that the Medicare rate, you know with the add-on payment remains 100? And then you talked about the, kind of the commercial reimbursement, you know, potentially declining over time, just any thoughts around kind of what the magnitude of changes on the commercial side you guys could potentially see in PCR?\nMark Guinan: Yeah, sure. I'll comment on then Steve may want to add. So yes, we would expect that as long as the, you know,  continues that this structure with the, you know, opportunity to earn $100 per test from CMS will continue now, you know, that is a very small portion of our volume. But we would expect that however, as I said in the prepared remarks, there is some risk, they could decouple it. There's no guarantee that that will continue. So, and \u2013 you know and not only could they decouple the reimbursement with the , but they could also, like they did January 1 change the approach. However, you know, at this point, yes, we're assuming the highest probability is that as long as the  continues, CMS will continue to pay us under this new method. You know, on commercial, obviously, we're not the only player. And so, you know, while we defend, and, you know, feel like we do a good job of explaining why our reimbursement makes sense, as we've negotiated some, you know, new payment methodologies, including some who wanted to move to the Medicare methodology, and we think we've done a good job, but obviously, there are other labs as well. And, you know, to the extent that other labs, you know, don't do as good a job as we do, there could be additional pressure on us. So that's why it's hard for us to predict exactly where this is going. But certainly, in our mind, you know, we would expect to continue to defend commercial contracts as well to the  seeing the same basis for CMS paying us at that rate should apply to the commercial payers as well. I also want to remind everybody that, as long as the zero patient out of pocket applies, that is also a huge tailwind for us because, you know, to avoid having to build patience, where historically, we've shared that we get about, you know, $0.70 on the dollar, and actually get, you know 100% of that payments from the third party is also a large enhancement to our revenue and our profitability as well. So that's, that's a factor I don't want people to forget about. Steve?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah, just to add to the CMS new methodology for reimbursement. As you know, we are reimbursed at $100 when we report the results in two days and $75 for all other results. And to Mark's comments, we have seen a few payers to look at this model as well. But we're encouraged by the public health emergency extension through 2021. And also, just to share our timeliness of our results are quite good. We have met that threshold of 50% of COVID. Molecular tests resulted in less than two days. We did that in the last few months. And I'll share that, you know, the majority of our testers are resulted in two days or less. So, in my other comments, I did mention that we continue to build capacity, because it just gives us a lot more operational flexibility to meet better turnaround times based upon where the demand is coming from. So, I think we're progressing well. We're very good provider of the test. You know, time is one element and quality and reliability, and also the type of testing we have done, you know, our methodology for PCR tests, both on the LDT side, and obviously, the kits are somewhat consistent throughout the industry, are really quite strong. So, if you look at the accuracy and the quality of our testing, you know, people have come to consider us the gold standard. And I think that will bode us well going forward as well.\nAdam Noble: And if I could just \u2026\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Eugene Kim your line is open, with Wolfe Research.\nEugene Kim: Good morning and thank you for all the color around guidance. Apologies if I missed this, but have you guys provided the average reimbursement levels for the PCR testing in Q4? And can you comment whether you're embedding similar levels in the first half guidance? \nMark Guinan: Yeah. So we didn't specifically call that out, but I can tell you that it did not change much in Q4 from where it was in Q3, you know, so, you know, it was above $90. We, you know, we do have some client bill customers that are less than 100. And we don't, you know, get paid for 100% of the testing, sometimes due to missing date, and so on and so forth. We do get some denials. But you know, certainly north of 90 was AWR previously. Now, we did talk about the fact that we expect that to have some pressure and reduce over time in the first half. That doesn't mean that it absolutely will. But in our guidance, in the midpoint of that guidance, we did make an assumption that, you know, given the new model with the $75, not just with CMS with some commercial payers, we're not going to get paid or 100% of our tests at that 100, where we have been done previously, still a large majority, as Steve said, meet that two-day turnaround time. So, that'll create a little bit of erosion. And then also, I mentioned that, you know, there's a lot of capacity there for a very competitive environment in that client bill arena aside from the third party.\nEugene Kim: Got it, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, on the base business, can I confirm you said, you don't think you'll get back to pre-pandemic levels in first half? And is that compared to 2019 or does that include our  as well? Thank you.\nMark Guinan: Yeah, that is correct. We would \u2013 I said was, you know, as we're looking at the back half, even though we're not giving guidance because there's too much uncertainty around it. We expect it to be back to pre-pandemic levels towards the end of 2021. So, in the first half, we still expect to be down versus 2019. We felt, even though the pandemic didn't start largely for our business till March, easiest compare and how to talk about it is 2019 volumes. We did have a large growth for the first two months of 2020 as we share that in our first quarter earnings call, you know, so that compounds things a little bit on a year-to-year comparison. But, yes, we're going to talk about our volume performance relative to 2019 because it's the cleanest compare for the whole year. \nSteve Rusckowski: And when we speak to that, I heard it in your question. We are looking at organic growth. And so you know, we spoke of a couple of acquisitions that we closed last year. And you know, in our organic discussions we're excluding those and any other deals we might do prospectively. So, it's organic, based business we're talking to.\nMark Guinan: And we think the best representation of utilization, so that's why we think it's important. Our organic performance versus 2019, kind of gives a sense, because of our size and reach. We think were the market overall is performing.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. So, the acquisition revenue will be on top of that. We obviously announced a couple of deals and what we said is, we have a good funnel and anything we might do prospectively be on top of what we said.\nOperator: Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi, great. Thank you and good morning. So, just one quick one. Can you provide a little bit more color on how should we think about the margin progression throughout 2021? And particularly how much of your, with the core business still being down, how much of that is the margin headwind? Just sort of thinking about the dynamics as we go from the first half, the second half with COVID volumes testing coming down, and you've returned to price to be more normal for the core business, just wanted to go get some thoughts on the margin progression of work flow, please? Thank you.\nMark Guinan: Sure. So, it depends, when you when you say is it a headwind? It depends on to what you're comparing it. So, as we, you know, expect the base business to improve. That's a significant margin tailwind versus the prior period, because we are in any given window of time, a highly fixed cost, you know, operation on our base business. And while we took some significant cost actions in the second quarter of last year in response to the significant downturn in our volume, and we've continued to manage our costs very, very tightly to the back half recoveries, and not get out in front of ourselves, you know, we're not planning on any significant restructuring in the near term with, you know, volumes that are down single digits at this point.  So, our cost structure on the basis business is, to some extent, what it is, and we'll add small, you know, pieces that are necessary as it recovers. But that, you know, growth and recovery in that base business sequentially is a nice tailwind. Now, on the other side, as we talked about, you know, expect erosion in our COVID volumes, you know that, you know, greater headwinds, and how those two pieces offset each other is hard to predict slightly, you know,  specifically. But, you know, I would at this point expect that the COVID reduction, more than offsets the base, but at least they do partially offset each other as we as we move forward.  And then the other dynamic is obviously reimbursement on the PCR test. And we shared that we expected some, you know, pressure on that as we go, you know, from the first quarter into the second quarter sequentially, and then likely, even more so in the back half of the year. So, without getting into specifics, those are kind of things you should, you know, specific numbers, those are kind of the things you should think about, as you think about where margins are going to go through the first half and into the second half of 2021.\nDerik de Bruin: Thank you.\nOperator: Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Lisa.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on your comment around the acquisition opportunities. Steve, you know, one of the things that was anticipated that with PAMA there'd be a lot of pressure and you'd see more acquisition opportunities with PAMA now being pushed out, does that change anything? Number one. And number two, when we think about reimbursement, as we've been talking about, for molecular tests, etcetera. I would think a lot of these labs have done well during this period of time, does that change what their expectations are at all around what their business is worth as we think about acquisition opportunities?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. So, thanks Lisa for the question. So, the first part is really about acquisition opportunities around hospitals. And, you know, you see that we announced a couple of deals last year that we were happy we did and that's going to help us and we continue to see a nice funnel for 2021 as well. And as you all know, hospital volumes up and down through 2020. They have recovered for us. However, what we do see is, a lot of renewed interest of looking at their lab strategies, which includes, you know, acquiring their outreach business and includes professional app service agreements, like we just announced in the fourth quarter. Now that relationship we announced in the fourth quarter with Hackensack Meridian Health system is the largest we've ever done. And I can tell you, it took a long time to get there. And I believe the prospective reality of what's happening in the healthcare market this year help bring that to a conclusion. And I believe that that will happen with a number of dialogues we have going on with hospitals right now. So that's one piece. The second is on other commercial laboratories. Yes, you're right. Number of commercial laboratories have jumped into the COVID testing arena. You see it with, you know, all the capacity we've added in the country. However, as that starts to be pulled back, and they start to see what the prospects are, given what we're driving as an industry, with consolidation, with tighter contracts and networks around health plans, we believe that, you know, there still will be a catalyst in the marketplace for us to continue to consolidate. So, yes, there's been a short-term opportunity for a number of labs to take advantage, if you will, the opportunity to provide COVID-19 testing. But as that starts to change, you know, as we get throughout 2021, we believe the realities of what the new world will be with, you know, tighter networks, more consolidation will play nicely into our strategy and allow us to acquire more going forward. And obviously, given our cash position and strong balance sheet, we\u2019re in a very nice position to continue to do that. And also, Lisa, there's been a lot of discussion around all this additional capacity out there.  People have added new systems, and, you know, potentially, does this present a risk for us that these people are going to get into other businesses outside of COVID, like ? You know, we are watching it, you know, obviously, some hospitals have moved their molecular capacity to COVID. And we help them with some of the other work, but for other commercial laboratories and hospitals to use that capacity to get into competing with us, by the way, good example,  that's a long stretch. I mean, there's a lot to \u2013 lot more to getting a client to flip over than the lab capacity, you have to have a Salesforce,  logistic capabilities, you have to do electronic interfaces, you have to work with the physicians, you have to be in a contract with the health plans. So, we are watching it, but at the same time, we're a little, you know, little cautious in, in the belief that some of this will have a significant effect. At the same time, we're watching it carefully to make sure it doesn't. And then we're staying on top of our clients to make sure we serve them well. Thank you.\nMark Guinan : So, if I could add Steve, just a couple things. Lisa, around your question, around our pipeline, at any given point in time, you know, we've got multiple opportunities that we're discussing, I can tell you that, you know, none of the potential sellers that we're speaking to right now are getting, you know expecting to get paid for that PCR bubble. So fortunately, I could see a mentality that, you know, hey, my value has gone up dramatically because of COVID testing. But you know, the people we're talking to right now recognize that that\u2019s short-term, and that should not be a part of the valuation discussion.  And then the, you know, while PAMA gets a pause this year, you know, there\u2019s still, you know, some risk. But more importantly, as you know, we've mentioned, and I'm sure you've seen, it's not just CMS, but the commercial payers are starting to, you know, put pressure on these high hospital outreach rates, you know, re-contracting, that work that's outside, you know, the patients who are in the hospital, either admitted or outpatient, at independent laboratory rate.  So it's not \u2013 this pressure is not just coming from Washington, it's coming from the commercial payers as well. And from quite frankly, patients who, you know don't like those high prices when they have a high deductible plan. So, there's a number of things that are getting the C suites of large hospital systems with outreach to think about. Do they really want to be in this business? And will this be a good time to monetize? And so therefore, I really don't see the pipeline of interest having been impacted over the last 12 months negatively.\nOperator: Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.\nMatt Larew: Hi, good morning. As I think about the various components of your response to COVID-19, and you're role in testing, two things that stick out as step changes from a pre-COVID  capacity, and then consumer engagement. I think the number of patients using QuestDirect has doubled in the last 15 months. So, just curious, what can you do and as we move to sort of a post-COVID world to leverage that increased consumer facing presents consumer engagement, as well as the added capacity that it sounds like you're still bringing on?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. Thanks for the question. And we're very bullish on our consumer strategy. As you all know, we have five strategies for growth, one of which is the consumer strategy and our direct-to-consumer business that we've built over the last several years has done quite well and we do believe that the pandemic has now been an accelerator for that. We're providing COVID-19 testing through that platform. We're going to look at using it for consumer genetics. And as I said, in my introductory comments, interesting part of the pandemic is brought to the forefront the strong role of testing and overall health care. And questioning has been out there more than ever, and our brand has been built. And our brand is really second to none in our industry. And we coupled that with our service performance. And so we have this strong foundation coupled with the change in the marketplace. And we do believe, you know, there's going to be a continuation of the number of consumers that are engaged, that will engage differently with healthcare delivery systems, and how they engage with the physician.  With telehealth, we have a very strong presence with telehealth providers and with integrated delivery systems that offer the telehealth option. But at the same time, a lot of patients as well, and consumers will want to receive their basic health checks and testing online as  so much else in their lives.  And so we're very well-positioned with reputation with capabilities. And so, we are investing in that in a significant way more so than we would have, if we did not have the pandemic. And so, we think about, you know, the growth drivers going forward, and we'll talk about this some more in our Investor Day. We're very bullish about the opportunity we have in front of us around our QuestDirect, but also the consumer opportunity in general.\nOperator: Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. Just one quick one on the deal side. Possible you could frame for us the Hackensack opportunity, the contribution to growth in 2021, and the first half guide? Thank you.\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to take that?\nMark Guinan: Yeah. So, we, you know, we don't typically announce the revenue impact of deals like this, and again, I want to remind you, this is organic. So, this is not something we bought. We worked with Hackensack and demonstrate to them that we can perform the same work they do in their lab at a better cost better value. And you know, for a system that size, you know, they're significant lab spend. So this is \u2013 is going to be quite impactful and beneficial to them, and we see that as a, you know, opportunity, obviously to also get other clients, who will get their attention to see Hackensack, you know, thinks that this will work well, you know, in addition to some of the other hospital systems that we've learned over the last couple of years. So, we're very, very excited about it. It is a large deal. It's the largest deal we've ever done. It will be, you know, material to our growth. And we talked a couple years ago at our Investor Day and we\u2019ll likely give an update on this. We thought we could get more than 100 basis points, and you know, somewhere between 100 basis points to 200 basis points of growth every year from our PLS business and certainly this one is a large contributor to that, and might even give us an opportunity to exceed that. So, you know, very large deal, but you know, we are not going to, we haven't had a historical precedent of pulling out the exact revenue, but it will be noticeable, and material as we go into 2021 and beyond.\nOperator: Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So, I mean, clearly, there's a lot of uncertainty around second half in the trajectory of the combat for more normalized utilization level, but if we step away from the timing and just think about the margin trajectory, how should we think about core margin trajectory from where they were, let's say in the fourth quarter, to where they can expand to as utilization comes back to a more normalized level? So again, the question is more about the margin trajectory, as it relates to utilization, not about the timing. And then my second question is more about, sort of a market demand. So, how do you think about changes in physician behavior patterns? And you know, we're seeing telehealth becoming more integrated into the workflow. So, do you think that there's going to be any impact on longer term lab testing demand curve because of that, I don\u2019t know if the experiences early in the year could shed some light on that?\nSteve Rusckowski : Sure. Mark, you want to take the first part. I\u2019ll take the second.\nMark Guinan: Yes. So, Ricky, obviously, the, you know, size of the revenue we've generated from COVID, which more than offset the base business has materially impacted our margins and expanded them greatly relative to our historical margins. So, as we, you know, progress. We'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but we progress into a future where, you know, COVID testing is still around for, you know, for a while. As Steve said, we don't expect it to go away completely, certainly, by 2022. It's going to be less material to our top line and to our margin.  So, where will our base business be? Once we get back to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, I would expect our base business to be, you know, slightly higher margin than it was pre-pandemic. Because as you look at, you know, our invigorate program, which we continue to drive, even during the pandemic, and you look at the offsets of the pay for is that we usually talk about, including wage inflation and price erosion, you know, given the pause on PAMA this year, and given, you know, the fact that we've done really well and other price concessions, despite, you know, significant increases in our  that was warranted during the pandemic, you know, as we wanted to reward our employees for their incredible contributions in getting us up and running, operating well threw it, and obviously driving strong company results. And when I net all those together, you know, that level of business should be more profitable. And then going forward from that, when we get back to the growth that you saw in 2019, and you saw in the first two months of 2020, and our ability to leverage that growth, you know, I would expect to see margin expansion on the base business, but of course, that will be partially offset for a period of time, as the COVID revenues and margins, you know, fall down. So, you know, longer-term, the good news is, you know, we were on a good path on growth and margin expansion pre-pandemic, and we will, you know, we'll get back there. But for a while, it'll be somewhat masked by the COVID decline that's inevitable, you know, over the next, certainly 18 months or so.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. And the question about physicians, Ricky, we're watching this carefully, because we do believe going back to an earlier question about the consumer activity there will be a transition here now going forward with physicians serving the market in a different way. You know, as we said before, about half the physicians have either sold their practices to integrate delivery systems or have strong affiliations with integrated delivery systems. And, you know, that will be consistent going forward. But the other half of the market, we believe there will be a growing percentage of that portion of physicians that are served by telehealth and we have a very strong position with those telehealth providers, and that was before the pandemic.  And those telehealth providers are not going to work with  of laboratories who will work with a few. And they will have a real type for lab network as you would expect. And as you would expect, Quest would be one of those options. So, we feel good about that. Second, as you see more consolidation going on in physicians and we see what's happening, particularly with one of the health insurance companies, , acquiring physicians and a number of those physician practices, or customers. You think about debt consolidation, and think about their role, not thinking about where they add value bringing all those physicians together. We believe there will be an opportunity for us to work with a consolidator, like , to provide lab services more broadly, and in really reduce the variation they have with other physicians. And just one last point to show that, you know, this world is moving towards tighter network of lab providers. In the fourth quarter of last year, United Healthcare actually announced the removal of lot of network benefit for some of their fully insured members. And so, it's just another example of a major health plan tightening up their network. So, we think the physician side will change and there'll be a different way of providing physician services to patients going forward. And that trend, we believe is a good trend and will provide tailwind for us to consolidate the market.\nOperator: Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Erin.\nErin Wright: Thanks. Thanks so much for sneaking me in. Just a follow up on that competitive landscape and consolidation. So it sounds like you don't expect there to be any sort of meaningful impact on your opportunity around consolidation just even given the dramatically expanded install bases, PCR instruments across the U.S. over the past year. I mean, I would assume that customers do want to monetize those investments to some extent, I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of market share shifting outside of maybe COVID testing that you're seeing already, if that's happening at all? I mean, it sounds like everything still remains an opportunity from an M&A perspective and consolidation standpoint. And then my second question is just on how should we be thinking about the long-term dynamics as it relates to COVID testing? It will obviously diminish with the vaccine rollout, but could it evolve into something more similar to like flu testing in future years? And can you remind us of the flu testing exposure you do have? Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski : Sure. So as I said earlier, we believe that hospitals will be now increasingly looking at their options to become more efficient, given the pressure, the pandemics put on any of them. And we're encouraged by, you know, the level of discussions we had, and, you know, the deals we've closed as an example that this is happening. So, we think that's good. On the commercial laboratory side, we believe that, you know, some have gotten into the COVID testing opportunity, it's provided somewhat of an opportunity for them to get through this year. But as you know, the dust settles and testing volumes go down, you know, the reality of what we talked about in  doesn't change.  And we think there will be many of those that would be looking at their options. And we do believe that COVID testing will continue into 2022. We believe that this, you know will be a virus that we'll have to manage. So, it will be more flu like, and something that will, you know, will be behind us and beyond 2021. And, you know, it's hard for us to scale at this time what that will be. But you should not think that this is going to be the testing opportunity that will go away at the end of this year. But we do believe there will be with us in 2022, as well.  And as far as the flu, you know, we talked about prior earnings call that we have offered a combination panel that when a patient presents itself with symptoms, the physician wants to rule out the flu, and also COVID. And so, we have seen, you know that be accepted, but as you all know, the incidence of flu this year is down considerably because of all our behaviors in the United States. So, that has changed somewhat. Shawn or Mark, you want to add something to food testing in general and exposure to answer the PAMA point of the question?\nMark Guinan: Yeah, I don't have anything to add. Shawn.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. I guess just one quick question. Mark, as I think about your capital deployment, obviously, you're generating a lot of cash. And it sounds like the hospital acquisition opportunities are the pipeline's there, but maybe a little slow in coming through. So, how should we be thinking about your willingness to buy back more aggressively in the front end? You know, and how should we be thinking about, just other capital deployment opportunities, whether it's internal, on the CapEx side for growth? \nMark Guinan: Sure. So, we are investing quite a bit internally. You know, as you may have seen or you will see our, you know, capital spend for 2020. You know, we ended up 418 million, which was above the initial range. A lot of that was related directly to the COVID capital that was necessary. But we certainly have not stepped back on investing internally, because we think that's the best way to drive returns. A lot of that, obviously, is related to our invigorate program. You know, we are moving all of our new  test to a single platform, we continue to move forward on that, and then a big piece of the 2020. And the first half of 2021 was related to Quest and our new facility. Although we started operating in early January, we still have some final set out in equipment to put in a narrow drive some of the spending in the first half. So, we absolutely have a high priority on internal capital. And we'll continue to do so. You can see we guided to 200 million in the first half, which is you know, about 50% of what we spent in 2020 as we step back a little bit from COVID capital, but we have some continued spending on Clifton and then also the normal priorities on which we spend. On share buybacks, as I mentioned, I will give a lot more color on the Investor Day. The reason for that is, you know, we do have some things that we're monitoring around potential cash deployment. We will have greater clarity on as we move over the next couple of weeks. We also wanted to get a little more of 2021, Q1, you know, behind us to see how that performance continues, and what our expectations, you know, for Q2 look like at that point, because every day, every couple of weeks, every month certainly gives us you know, better line of sight and expectations. But, you know, by announced by, you know us seeking and getting approval and announcing a billion dollar increase in our authorization, certainly you correctly are taking that as a signal. And as I said, specifically in my prepared remarks, that we're going to do more share buybacks than we have done historically. And I'll remind you that our capital allocation strategy, which we have not changed to this point is to give the majority of our free cash flow back to our shareholders to our dividend. And our share repurchases, we suspended them for 2020 for a period of time. But even with the 250, you know, we spent in Q4 and the increase in dividend over time, you know, we're behind that 50%. So, we have some catch-up to do. \nSteve Rusckowski: Let me just add to that performance we had in 2020 and the performance that we're indicating, with our guidance in 2021, is affording us an opportunity to invest in our growth strategies. And that includes what we've talked about on this call. Working on the relationships with health plans are gaining traction was presenting our lab strategy view to health systems, hospital health systems, what we're doing around advanced diagnostics, and then finally, what was asked about earlier around the consumer opportunity in front of us. So, implied in the guidance is an increase in investment for those growth drivers to accelerate growth of our base business within 2021, but as we enter 2022 as well. So if there are no further questions. I like to thank everyone for again joining us on this call. We appreciate your continued support and interest and you have a great day. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter and full-year 2020 conference call.

            "name": "Steve Rusckowski",
            "content": "Thanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. So, in the year dominated by the pandemic, Quest brought critical COVID-19 testing to our country, and delivered record revenues, earnings, and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2020. The pandemic has tested our nearly 50,000 employees and they have responded as heroes, by developing COVID-19 tests, building test capacity, innovating new testing models with our retail partners, transporting specimens, delivering results, and of course, supporting our customers. Thanks Mark. Well to summarize, I'd like to thank all Quest employees who have worked tirelessly over the past year. They have delivered a significant portion of the country's COVID-19 testing, while serving the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. Thanks to their heroic efforts, we delivered record revenues, earnings, and cash from operations for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2020. In light of the company's strong financial performance, we have increased our dividend and share repurchase authorization while maintaining flexibility to pursue our M&A strategy. We look forward to sharing a more in-depth update on our market views and strategy at our upcoming virtual Investor Day to be held on Thursday, March 11. Stay tuned for additional details on that day. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Mark, you want to start it? Let me just add to that. Speaking to demand,  shares that over the course of the last 10 months, we've brought up our capacity considerably, and we're going to continue to build it. And the reason for that is, we want to continue to be prepared in the event that we do have another surge. And then secondly is, we want to make sure we really have a capability to meet turnaround times that are expected in the market.  And over the last 10 months, obviously, a lot of retesting has been for the clinical purpose and what we believe as we entered the second half, and we're having many discussions in this regard, there's going to be a lot more demand for return to work programs with employers, which have been pushed out, as you all know, return to leisure activities, there's a number of cities that have large tourism bases that are thinking about what they need to do to get people back into those venues.  And there will be a lot of activity around just return to life. And I know that we are still trying to figure that out. And that's going to offer us a lot of opportunity in the future. And with that, there's always a COVID test, but there's also a number of services we provide, and those are yet to be defined. So, we're still trying to understand what that second half opportunity would be. But what we see so far, we will continue to have strong demand, but it may take a different form as we get into the second half and as we go into 22. Thanks, Ralph. Well let me \u2013 the step-up is, you know the step-up that we've seen based on the strong delivery that we had in the fourth quarter in the beginning of January. So, we are \u2013 as I said in my introductory comments, you know, we are one of the leading providers of COVID-19 testing. Second is, it does not include serology and did ask a question about serology, because we do believe there'll be an increasing role of serology throughout 2021. We seem to see some early indications that there's interest in understanding whether you have the antibodies or not, which might inform patients and physicians around, you know, their urgency of getting vaccinated. And at the same time, we're bringing out a new capability called  testing, and this will allow physicians and patients to see if in fact, they do get the spike protein from the vaccines. And we'll be bringing that out at platforms in the next few weeks. And you know, this can help us, you know, determining the vaccine is being effective.  So, we do believe that there will be some increased demands for serology, and this is on top of what we already do. And serology is providing a really important role for management of the disease, overall surveillance, epidemiology, and in measuring the response of what's happening pre and post-vaccinations and broad population. So, we believe there's an opportunity in front of us in 2021 in that regard. Hi, Jack. Yeah, so I think, you know, the new administration is leveraging what we've done in the past as a country and as an industry, and taking it to the next level. I mean, you see the capacity that's out there around the country. Back a few weeks ago, we were doing about 2 million COVID-19 molecular tests. So, obviously up considerably from where we all started last March. But going forward, Jack, I do see that there'll be a change beyond the PCR test. As I mentioned earlier, now there's going to be a greater demand, you know, for programs that get to portions of the population that help us get back to work, back to leisure activities, get back to life. And so, we're having a number of dialogues around that. And that will include the role of antigen testing, and more rapid testing workflows that allow us to see if the fact a person that wants to engage in whatever the activity is, is negative and safe for a reasonable period of time to participate. So, when we get into that world, you know we'll obviously be providing the testing, but as I said earlier, there's a number of services, and also IT solutions that you need to provide. And, like so much in healthcare, you see one, but we're currently engaged with a number of organizations, a number of municipalities, and a number of corporations, and what they will be doing in this regard, particularly in the second half.  I think, you know, the first quarter is outlined in our guidance  start to see improvement as we get into the second quarter. I think the second quarter will be a telling quarter for us all. And we do see a lot of people getting prepared for, you know, better infection rates, you know, better position for populations to get back to work life and leisure activities, and we're going to start to see more of that and Quest has a significant role in helping in that regard. You know, let me start with where you ended, I think our relationship with health plans has never been better. As you've seen over the last number of years, we've increased our presence, we have the best access to lives now that we've had in over a decade. And so, we are in a very strong footing. And also, during the pandemic I'll share that we were deeply engaged with many of the plans of what they needed to take care of their membership, and also their employees. So, the relationship is continued to strengthen. And as I said, in my introductory remarks, and Mark said, as well, we're shifting the dialogue away from exclusively price to the value we deliver. And when you go back to what we talked about in the past around what we bring to the table in terms of our value proposition around quality, our service performance, our innovation, all at a very affordable price, we believe our value proposition is really second to none. And as I said, you know in the course of the last year, we've done service, look at our reputation in the industry and net promoter scores, and those are quite strong. So, when you bring those facts to the table Jack, our position in terms of working out, the forward-looking relationships has, you know, provided a much stronger foundation, and a better understanding on the other side that we really do deliver a lot more value. So, we're in a good position with our plans. We're in good position with our contracts. We obviously don't provide specific details, but we feel very good about that. And also, I shared that we continue to make progress with our united relationship with a preferred lab network and the building relationship with Anthem were quite encouraged about as well. So, we feel good about a relationship and the progress we've made, but also the opportunities in front of us to continue to build on what we've been talking about. So, Mark anything you could like to add there? Yeah, just to add to the CMS new methodology for reimbursement. As you know, we are reimbursed at $100 when we report the results in two days and $75 for all other results. And to Mark's comments, we have seen a few payers to look at this model as well. But we're encouraged by the public health emergency extension through 2021. And also, just to share our timeliness of our results are quite good. We have met that threshold of 50% of COVID. Molecular tests resulted in less than two days. We did that in the last few months. And I'll share that, you know, the majority of our testers are resulted in two days or less. So, in my other comments, I did mention that we continue to build capacity, because it just gives us a lot more operational flexibility to meet better turnaround times based upon where the demand is coming from. So, I think we're progressing well. We're very good provider of the test. You know, time is one element and quality and reliability, and also the type of testing we have done, you know, our methodology for PCR tests, both on the LDT side, and obviously, the kits are somewhat consistent throughout the industry, are really quite strong. So, if you look at the accuracy and the quality of our testing, you know, people have come to consider us the gold standard. And I think that will bode us well going forward as well. And when we speak to that, I heard it in your question. We are looking at organic growth. And so you know, we spoke of a couple of acquisitions that we closed last year. And you know, in our organic discussions we're excluding those and any other deals we might do prospectively. So, it's organic, based business we're talking to. Yeah. So, the acquisition revenue will be on top of that. We obviously announced a couple of deals and what we said is, we have a good funnel and anything we might do prospectively be on top of what we said. Hi, Lisa. Yeah. So, thanks Lisa for the question. So, the first part is really about acquisition opportunities around hospitals. And, you know, you see that we announced a couple of deals last year that we were happy we did and that's going to help us and we continue to see a nice funnel for 2021 as well. And as you all know, hospital volumes up and down through 2020. They have recovered for us. However, what we do see is, a lot of renewed interest of looking at their lab strategies, which includes, you know, acquiring their outreach business and includes professional app service agreements, like we just announced in the fourth quarter. Now that relationship we announced in the fourth quarter with Hackensack Meridian Health system is the largest we've ever done. And I can tell you, it took a long time to get there. And I believe the prospective reality of what's happening in the healthcare market this year help bring that to a conclusion. And I believe that that will happen with a number of dialogues we have going on with hospitals right now. So that's one piece. The second is on other commercial laboratories. Yes, you're right. Number of commercial laboratories have jumped into the COVID testing arena. You see it with, you know, all the capacity we've added in the country. However, as that starts to be pulled back, and they start to see what the prospects are, given what we're driving as an industry, with consolidation, with tighter contracts and networks around health plans, we believe that, you know, there still will be a catalyst in the marketplace for us to continue to consolidate. So, yes, there's been a short-term opportunity for a number of labs to take advantage, if you will, the opportunity to provide COVID-19 testing. But as that starts to change, you know, as we get throughout 2021, we believe the realities of what the new world will be with, you know, tighter networks, more consolidation will play nicely into our strategy and allow us to acquire more going forward. And obviously, given our cash position and strong balance sheet, we're in a very nice position to continue to do that. And also, Lisa, there's been a lot of discussion around all this additional capacity out there.  People have added new systems, and, you know, potentially, does this present a risk for us that these people are going to get into other businesses outside of COVID, like ? You know, we are watching it, you know, obviously, some hospitals have moved their molecular capacity to COVID. And we help them with some of the other work, but for other commercial laboratories and hospitals to use that capacity to get into competing with us, by the way, good example,  that's a long stretch. I mean, there's a lot to \u2013 lot more to getting a client to flip over than the lab capacity, you have to have a Salesforce,  logistic capabilities, you have to do electronic interfaces, you have to work with the physicians, you have to be in a contract with the health plans. So, we are watching it, but at the same time, we're a little, you know, little cautious in, in the belief that some of this will have a significant effect. At the same time, we're watching it carefully to make sure it doesn't. And then we're staying on top of our clients to make sure we serve them well. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks for the question. And we're very bullish on our consumer strategy. As you all know, we have five strategies for growth, one of which is the consumer strategy and our direct-to-consumer business that we've built over the last several years has done quite well and we do believe that the pandemic has now been an accelerator for that. We're providing COVID-19 testing through that platform. We're going to look at using it for consumer genetics. And as I said, in my introductory comments, interesting part of the pandemic is brought to the forefront the strong role of testing and overall health care. And questioning has been out there more than ever, and our brand has been built. And our brand is really second to none in our industry. And we coupled that with our service performance. And so we have this strong foundation coupled with the change in the marketplace. And we do believe, you know, there's going to be a continuation of the number of consumers that are engaged, that will engage differently with healthcare delivery systems, and how they engage with the physician.  With telehealth, we have a very strong presence with telehealth providers and with integrated delivery systems that offer the telehealth option. But at the same time, a lot of patients as well, and consumers will want to receive their basic health checks and testing online as  so much else in their lives.  And so we're very well-positioned with reputation with capabilities. And so, we are investing in that in a significant way more so than we would have, if we did not have the pandemic. And so, we think about, you know, the growth drivers going forward, and we'll talk about this some more in our Investor Day. We're very bullish about the opportunity we have in front of us around our QuestDirect, but also the consumer opportunity in general. Mark, you want to take that? Sure. Mark, you want to take the first part. I'll take the second. Yeah. And the question about physicians, Ricky, we're watching this carefully, because we do believe going back to an earlier question about the consumer activity there will be a transition here now going forward with physicians serving the market in a different way. You know, as we said before, about half the physicians have either sold their practices to integrate delivery systems or have strong affiliations with integrated delivery systems. And, you know, that will be consistent going forward. But the other half of the market, we believe there will be a growing percentage of that portion of physicians that are served by telehealth and we have a very strong position with those telehealth providers, and that was before the pandemic.  And those telehealth providers are not going to work with  of laboratories who will work with a few. And they will have a real type for lab network as you would expect. And as you would expect, Quest would be one of those options. So, we feel good about that. Second, as you see more consolidation going on in physicians and we see what's happening, particularly with one of the health insurance companies, , acquiring physicians and a number of those physician practices, or customers. You think about debt consolidation, and think about their role, not thinking about where they add value bringing all those physicians together. We believe there will be an opportunity for us to work with a consolidator, like , to provide lab services more broadly, and in really reduce the variation they have with other physicians. And just one last point to show that, you know, this world is moving towards tighter network of lab providers. In the fourth quarter of last year, United Healthcare actually announced the removal of lot of network benefit for some of their fully insured members. And so, it's just another example of a major health plan tightening up their network. So, we think the physician side will change and there'll be a different way of providing physician services to patients going forward. And that trend, we believe is a good trend and will provide tailwind for us to consolidate the market. Hi, Erin. Sure. So as I said earlier, we believe that hospitals will be now increasingly looking at their options to become more efficient, given the pressure, the pandemics put on any of them. And we're encouraged by, you know, the level of discussions we had, and, you know, the deals we've closed as an example that this is happening. So, we think that's good. On the commercial laboratory side, we believe that, you know, some have gotten into the COVID testing opportunity, it's provided somewhat of an opportunity for them to get through this year. But as you know, the dust settles and testing volumes go down, you know, the reality of what we talked about in  doesn't change.  And we think there will be many of those that would be looking at their options. And we do believe that COVID testing will continue into 2022. We believe that this, you know will be a virus that we'll have to manage. So, it will be more flu like, and something that will, you know, will be behind us and beyond 2021. And, you know, it's hard for us to scale at this time what that will be. But you should not think that this is going to be the testing opportunity that will go away at the end of this year. But we do believe there will be with us in 2022, as well.  And as far as the flu, you know, we talked about prior earnings call that we have offered a combination panel that when a patient presents itself with symptoms, the physician wants to rule out the flu, and also COVID. And so, we have seen, you know that be accepted, but as you all know, the incidence of flu this year is down considerably because of all our behaviors in the United States. So, that has changed somewhat. Shawn or Mark, you want to add something to food testing in general and exposure to answer the PAMA point of the question? Let me just add to that performance we had in 2020 and the performance that we're indicating, with our guidance in 2021, is affording us an opportunity to invest in our growth strategies. And that includes what we've talked about on this call. Working on the relationships with health plans are gaining traction was presenting our lab strategy view to health systems, hospital health systems, what we're doing around advanced diagnostics, and then finally, what was asked about earlier around the consumer opportunity in front of us. So, implied in the guidance is an increase in investment for those growth drivers to accelerate growth of our base business within 2021, but as we enter 2022 as well. So if there are no further questions. I like to thank everyone for again joining us on this call. We appreciate your continued support and interest and you have a great day. Take care."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $3 billion, up nearly 56% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew approximately 58%, compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services, offset by a modest decline in our base testing revenue. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 26.8% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing 4.5%. As we highlighted in our 2020 outlook update in mid-December, organic testing volumes ordered in our base business were down mid-to-high single digits versus the prior year in October and November. The recovery stalled in late November with organic testing volume trends down high-single-digits versus the prior year in December due to the surge in new infections across the country. Sure. So, you know, we are expecting, you know, to still do quite well in terms of reimbursement in the near term. We believe we can meet the turnaround times, certainly the threshold that's required to be eligible for the higher rates, and then we get paid, obviously, based on the individual tests.  So, you know, we're still thinking in the near term that our average weighted reimbursement is going to be pretty strong, but we also recognize the reality, you know, the pressure on the industry, from all the various payers, especially the commercial payers, and so therefore, as we mentioned, you know, throughout the first half of the year, we would expect, you know, some reduction in that reimbursement, not something, you know, that would be momentous, but certainly some downward pressure. And as we said, the client area is very, very competitive. So there's, you know, quite a few labs at this point, given the demand that have significant capacity. And so therefore, in the  it's very, very competitive. You know, in terms of your questions, I'm sure you can appreciate Ralph that first off, we don't feel we're getting paid excessively for COVID PCR, and we feel like we're being paid appropriately. But even if you could exactly forecast the volume of our COVID testing, and forecast the base business, you know, over a period of time, which obviously would be nearly impossible, you know, I'm not sure that we need to trade off anything.  We're very happy with the relationships that we built, as Steve mentioned, with the payers, we've moved away from a focus on price and move toward more of a partnership and a, you know, alignment around value creation, where, you know, they're looking for us to save the money and create value and big piece of that is moving more work to us because we're already \u2013 they're very, you know, high value compared to the rest of the industry and, you know, possible choices for patients. So, you know, good question, Ralph, certainly appreciate it, but for practical and for strategic reasons, because of where we think we are with the payers already with some of these new contracts, certainly not something that we're looking to pursue right now. Yeah. Sure Justin. So, you know it's multivariable. So there's several ways you could come to the high and low-end. So, what I would say is, you know, they're all based on the three major drivers with most of it being on the base volume recovery, and the level of PCR, you know, volume to lesser extent, serology. So, you know, if we don't see a significant fall off from where we stand today, in PCR, or if it, you know, surges up again, you know, because of these variants, or some other unknown factors, certainly that would take us, you know, to the higher-end combined with, you know, if the base business also were to continue to recover and not, you know, go the opposite direction as COVID surged again.  So, there is some negative correlation, obviously, between the two. But if they both move in the same direction, that would move us to the higher-end. And then if for some reason COVID fell off markedly, even more than we're planning, and as we talked about, we are planning for a decline over time in the first six months, as that midpoint, and the base business did not show recovery, or even, you know, potentially take a little bit of step back for economic or other reasons.  And that would take you to the low end, but you know, I can't at this point, provide exact, you know, changes in the base and COVID, because, obviously, there's multiple ways to get to either one, but directionally that's what, you know,  that our guidance with the midpoint being, as I said, you know, a modest recovery, but not full for the first six months of the base business. And then some step off, but still significant COVID testing for the first six months with the second quarter being, you know, markedly lower than the first quarter. Sure. Steve, do you want to take that or would you like me to. Sure. So Jack, I understand the question and several years ago, I think there was an expectation where, you know people holding their breath, every time we extended a contract with a major payer because it would imply some sort of major price concession. I can tell you, you know, this has become largely invisible to you all, you know unless we talk about it like Anthem, which was really a new contract and brought together a number of states under a single contract, as opposed to having, you know different periods of time in which we were negotiating across the Anthem network. We just extended with a major commercial payer. You didn't hear about it, because there was no price concession. And in fact, we made huge headway with this payer. And, you know, getting them to acknowledge that in the world of PAMA, the whole notion of a discount to the CMS NLA rates no longer will apply going forward. And that, in fact, you know, CMS will be setting the market and that they should feel confident, is a market rate that they can feel comfortable and represent to their prospective or current members.  So, you know, really that's what it's been about, as they all want to make sure that they can say, they've got good prices. And now you've got an external benchmark, you can look to. So, we just extended with a very large national. We do have one coming up this year. But I can assure you that it's not going to be \u2013 it will not come with a major price concessions, you know, we're going to continue to work on the value-based contracting and with that actually comes good pricing that we feel, you know, represents the market, and then these come with upside, whereas we performed, you know, we both share in the benefit of that upside. That's the way we're really contracting in the last couple years and how we would expect to contract going forward. Yeah, sure. I'll comment on then Steve may want to add. So yes, we would expect that as long as the, you know,  continues that this structure with the, you know, opportunity to earn $100 per test from CMS will continue now, you know, that is a very small portion of our volume. But we would expect that however, as I said in the prepared remarks, there is some risk, they could decouple it. There's no guarantee that that will continue. So, and \u2013 you know and not only could they decouple the reimbursement with the , but they could also, like they did January 1 change the approach. However, you know, at this point, yes, we're assuming the highest probability is that as long as the  continues, CMS will continue to pay us under this new method. You know, on commercial, obviously, we're not the only player. And so, you know, while we defend, and, you know, feel like we do a good job of explaining why our reimbursement makes sense, as we've negotiated some, you know, new payment methodologies, including some who wanted to move to the Medicare methodology, and we think we've done a good job, but obviously, there are other labs as well. And, you know, to the extent that other labs, you know, don't do as good a job as we do, there could be additional pressure on us. So that's why it's hard for us to predict exactly where this is going. But certainly, in our mind, you know, we would expect to continue to defend commercial contracts as well to the  seeing the same basis for CMS paying us at that rate should apply to the commercial payers as well. I also want to remind everybody that, as long as the zero patient out of pocket applies, that is also a huge tailwind for us because, you know, to avoid having to build patience, where historically, we've shared that we get about, you know, $0.70 on the dollar, and actually get, you know 100% of that payments from the third party is also a large enhancement to our revenue and our profitability as well. So that's, that's a factor I don't want people to forget about. Steve? Yeah. So we didn't specifically call that out, but I can tell you that it did not change much in Q4 from where it was in Q3, you know, so, you know, it was above $90. We, you know, we do have some client bill customers that are less than 100. And we don't, you know, get paid for 100% of the testing, sometimes due to missing date, and so on and so forth. We do get some denials. But you know, certainly north of 90 was AWR previously. Now, we did talk about the fact that we expect that to have some pressure and reduce over time in the first half. That doesn't mean that it absolutely will. But in our guidance, in the midpoint of that guidance, we did make an assumption that, you know, given the new model with the $75, not just with CMS with some commercial payers, we're not going to get paid or 100% of our tests at that 100, where we have been done previously, still a large majority, as Steve said, meet that two-day turnaround time. So, that'll create a little bit of erosion. And then also, I mentioned that, you know, there's a lot of capacity there for a very competitive environment in that client bill arena aside from the third party. Yeah, that is correct. We would \u2013 I said was, you know, as we're looking at the back half, even though we're not giving guidance because there's too much uncertainty around it. We expect it to be back to pre-pandemic levels towards the end of 2021. So, in the first half, we still expect to be down versus 2019. We felt, even though the pandemic didn't start largely for our business till March, easiest compare and how to talk about it is 2019 volumes. We did have a large growth for the first two months of 2020 as we share that in our first quarter earnings call, you know, so that compounds things a little bit on a year-to-year comparison. But, yes, we're going to talk about our volume performance relative to 2019 because it's the cleanest compare for the whole year. And we think the best representation of utilization, so that's why we think it's important. Our organic performance versus 2019, kind of gives a sense, because of our size and reach. We think were the market overall is performing. Sure. So, it depends, when you when you say is it a headwind? It depends on to what you're comparing it. So, as we, you know, expect the base business to improve. That's a significant margin tailwind versus the prior period, because we are in any given window of time, a highly fixed cost, you know, operation on our base business. And while we took some significant cost actions in the second quarter of last year in response to the significant downturn in our volume, and we've continued to manage our costs very, very tightly to the back half recoveries, and not get out in front of ourselves, you know, we're not planning on any significant restructuring in the near term with, you know, volumes that are down single digits at this point.  So, our cost structure on the basis business is, to some extent, what it is, and we'll add small, you know, pieces that are necessary as it recovers. But that, you know, growth and recovery in that base business sequentially is a nice tailwind. Now, on the other side, as we talked about, you know, expect erosion in our COVID volumes, you know that, you know, greater headwinds, and how those two pieces offset each other is hard to predict slightly, you know,  specifically. But, you know, I would at this point expect that the COVID reduction, more than offsets the base, but at least they do partially offset each other as we as we move forward.  And then the other dynamic is obviously reimbursement on the PCR test. And we shared that we expected some, you know, pressure on that as we go, you know, from the first quarter into the second quarter sequentially, and then likely, even more so in the back half of the year. So, without getting into specifics, those are kind of things you should, you know, specific numbers, those are kind of the things you should think about, as you think about where margins are going to go through the first half and into the second half of 2021. So, if I could add Steve, just a couple things. Lisa, around your question, around our pipeline, at any given point in time, you know, we've got multiple opportunities that we're discussing, I can tell you that, you know, none of the potential sellers that we're speaking to right now are getting, you know expecting to get paid for that PCR bubble. So fortunately, I could see a mentality that, you know, hey, my value has gone up dramatically because of COVID testing. But you know, the people we're talking to right now recognize that that's short-term, and that should not be a part of the valuation discussion.  And then the, you know, while PAMA gets a pause this year, you know, there's still, you know, some risk. But more importantly, as you know, we've mentioned, and I'm sure you've seen, it's not just CMS, but the commercial payers are starting to, you know, put pressure on these high hospital outreach rates, you know, re-contracting, that work that's outside, you know, the patients who are in the hospital, either admitted or outpatient, at independent laboratory rate.  So it's not \u2013 this pressure is not just coming from Washington, it's coming from the commercial payers as well. And from quite frankly, patients who, you know don't like those high prices when they have a high deductible plan. So, there's a number of things that are getting the C suites of large hospital systems with outreach to think about. Do they really want to be in this business? And will this be a good time to monetize? And so therefore, I really don't see the pipeline of interest having been impacted over the last 12 months negatively. Yeah. So, we, you know, we don't typically announce the revenue impact of deals like this, and again, I want to remind you, this is organic. So, this is not something we bought. We worked with Hackensack and demonstrate to them that we can perform the same work they do in their lab at a better cost better value. And you know, for a system that size, you know, they're significant lab spend. So this is \u2013 is going to be quite impactful and beneficial to them, and we see that as a, you know, opportunity, obviously to also get other clients, who will get their attention to see Hackensack, you know, thinks that this will work well, you know, in addition to some of the other hospital systems that we've learned over the last couple of years. So, we're very, very excited about it. It is a large deal. It's the largest deal we've ever done. It will be, you know, material to our growth. And we talked a couple years ago at our Investor Day and we'll likely give an update on this. We thought we could get more than 100 basis points, and you know, somewhere between 100 basis points to 200 basis points of growth every year from our PLS business and certainly this one is a large contributor to that, and might even give us an opportunity to exceed that. So, you know, very large deal, but you know, we are not going to, we haven't had a historical precedent of pulling out the exact revenue, but it will be noticeable, and material as we go into 2021 and beyond. Yes. So, Ricky, obviously, the, you know, size of the revenue we've generated from COVID, which more than offset the base business has materially impacted our margins and expanded them greatly relative to our historical margins. So, as we, you know, progress. We'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but we progress into a future where, you know, COVID testing is still around for, you know, for a while. As Steve said, we don't expect it to go away completely, certainly, by 2022. It's going to be less material to our top line and to our margin.  So, where will our base business be? Once we get back to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, I would expect our base business to be, you know, slightly higher margin than it was pre-pandemic. Because as you look at, you know, our invigorate program, which we continue to drive, even during the pandemic, and you look at the offsets of the pay for is that we usually talk about, including wage inflation and price erosion, you know, given the pause on PAMA this year, and given, you know, the fact that we've done really well and other price concessions, despite, you know, significant increases in our  that was warranted during the pandemic, you know, as we wanted to reward our employees for their incredible contributions in getting us up and running, operating well threw it, and obviously driving strong company results. And when I net all those together, you know, that level of business should be more profitable. And then going forward from that, when we get back to the growth that you saw in 2019, and you saw in the first two months of 2020, and our ability to leverage that growth, you know, I would expect to see margin expansion on the base business, but of course, that will be partially offset for a period of time, as the COVID revenues and margins, you know, fall down. So, you know, longer-term, the good news is, you know, we were on a good path on growth and margin expansion pre-pandemic, and we will, you know, we'll get back there. But for a while, it'll be somewhat masked by the COVID decline that's inevitable, you know, over the next, certainly 18 months or so. Yeah, I don't have anything to add. Shawn. Sure. So, we are investing quite a bit internally. You know, as you may have seen or you will see our, you know, capital spend for 2020. You know, we ended up 418 million, which was above the initial range. A lot of that was related directly to the COVID capital that was necessary. But we certainly have not stepped back on investing internally, because we think that's the best way to drive returns. A lot of that, obviously, is related to our invigorate program. You know, we are moving all of our new  test to a single platform, we continue to move forward on that, and then a big piece of the 2020. And the first half of 2021 was related to Quest and our new facility. Although we started operating in early January, we still have some final set out in equipment to put in a narrow drive some of the spending in the first half. So, we absolutely have a high priority on internal capital. And we'll continue to do so. You can see we guided to 200 million in the first half, which is you know, about 50% of what we spent in 2020 as we step back a little bit from COVID capital, but we have some continued spending on Clifton and then also the normal priorities on which we spend. On share buybacks, as I mentioned, I will give a lot more color on the Investor Day. The reason for that is, you know, we do have some things that we're monitoring around potential cash deployment. We will have greater clarity on as we move over the next couple of weeks. We also wanted to get a little more of 2021, Q1, you know, behind us to see how that performance continues, and what our expectations, you know, for Q2 look like at that point, because every day, every couple of weeks, every month certainly gives us you know, better line of sight and expectations. But, you know, by announced by, you know us seeking and getting approval and announcing a billion dollar increase in our authorization, certainly you correctly are taking that as a signal. And as I said, specifically in my prepared remarks, that we're going to do more share buybacks than we have done historically. And I'll remind you that our capital allocation strategy, which we have not changed to this point is to give the majority of our free cash flow back to our shareholders to our dividend. And our share repurchases, we suspended them for 2020 for a period of time. But even with the 250, you know, we spent in Q4 and the increase in dividend over time, you know, we're behind that 50%. So, we have some catch-up to do."

I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and/or financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic\u2019s severity and duration, the pandemic\u2019s impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic which are drivers beyond the company\u2019s knowledge and control.

References to base testing volumes or base business refer to testing volumes excluding COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes.  Finally, growth rate associated with our long term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compounded annual growth rates. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.\nStephen Rusckowski: Thanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Quest had a very strong third quarter, benefiting from continued demand from COVID-19 testing as well as the rapid recovery from healthcare utilization. We have performed over 22 million COVID-19 molecular and serology tests to date, more than any other provider. We\u2019ve also developed and introduced several new innovations that are contributing to enabling the country\u2019s ability to return to work, the classroom, and on the athletic field.  I\u2019m extremely proud of all that Quest Diagnostics has accomplished through the COVID-19 pandemic and I want to thank our 47,000 employees for their hard work and dedication.  This morning I\u2019ll discuss our performance for the quarter, our role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and update you on our non-COVID base business, and then Mark will provide more detail on the third quarter results and our updated financial outlook for the remainder of the year. Our financial performance in the third quarter was very strong. For the quarter, total revenue grew by more than 42% to $2.79 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 164% on a reported basis to $4.14 and nearly 145% on an adjusted basis to $4.31. These results reflect continued demand for COVID-19 testing and continued recovery of our base testing volumes as healthcare systems resume non-urgent care and elective surgeries. Organic base testing volumes orders declined high single digits in July and improved in the quarter to mid to high single digit declines in September versus the prior year. Demand for COVID-19 testing came from several areas: clinical testing ordered by healthcare providers as the virus spread throughout much of the country, especially for non COVID-19 pre-surgical patients and people in high risk populations like nursing homes and prisons; in retail testing in our standard network access points, such as our drive-through sites offered across the country by CVS and Wal-Mart; workplace testing as employers sought to return employees to the job and their offices; university testing to facilitate the return of students to campus life, including sports; and our consumer testing direct testing offered by Quest Direct. We\u2019ve also demonstrated innovation and agility in bringing COVID-19 testing to our nation. In the quarter, we were granted an emergency use authorization, or EUA to offer unobserved self-collection. We were the first provider to receive an EUA due to the pandemic or [indiscernible]. Finally, we teamed up with Wal-Mart and DroneUp to pilot a program for contactless delivery of specialty kits using drones.  Also in the quarter, we announced an initiative along with our Quest Diagnostics Foundation to address and reduce healthcare disparities in underserved communities, including those impacted by COVID-19. This value-based commitment builds on our existing work with [indiscernible] health centers and will focus on serving people of color, elderly and underserved populations in locations throughout the United States. Quest plans to donate testing services and fund a range of initiatives estimated to total more than $100 million. Our goal is to improve access to testing and drive awareness of value of diagnostic innovations and managing health. Before updating you on our base business, what I\u2019d like to do is comment on our recent CMS change to Medicare payment for COVID-19 testing and our decision to return the CARES Act funding to the government. In conjunction with our trade association, we\u2019ve been currently reviewing the new reimbursement policy for high throughput COVID-19 molecular testing from CMS will impact laboratory and patients we serve. Last week\u2019s announcement removes uncertainty that was an overhang on COVID-19 testing reimbursement.  Finally, we\u2019re grateful for the CARES Act funding from last spring which provided us at an important time of great uncertainty for our country. Now several months into the pandemic, we no longer require this funding and as a result, we will be returning these funds to the government. That was the right thing to do. We\u2019re making progress on our strategy to accelerate growth in the base business, so as a reminder, the five elements of our strategy to accelerate are to grow more than 2% per year through strategically aligned, accretive acquisitions; expand relationships with health plan and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then finally, support population health with data analytics and extended care services.  Now I\u2019ll share a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Our M&A pipeline remains strong. Since the second quarter, we close our acquisition of Mid America Clinical Laboratories, referred to as MACL, which is Indiana, and we did a couple two small tuck-in acquisitions. Our recent acquisitions have been performing well during the pandemic; for example, our Memorial Hermann outreach acquisition announced earlier this year, as well as this recent MACL acquisition have driven growth in both COVID-19 testing and our base business. We\u2019ve also seen growth in advanced diagnostics from our acquisition of Blueprint Genetics.  The second growth driver, expanding relationships with health plan and hospital health systems is also delivering. Our hospital reference testing volumes excluding COVID-19 have returned to growth year over year. Given the challenges that hospitals are facing, we expect many more to be open to discussions about how Quest can help them achieve their lab strategy, so in professional lab services this year we have logged a record amount of bookings, represent larger and longer term agreements than in the past.  We also continue to make progress on our health plan strategy. Within the UnitedHealthcare preferred laboratory network, we\u2019re helping United reduce out-of-PLN lab spending through the previously announced zero out-of-pocket benefit. In addition, United has added enhancements that reduce the administrative burden for physicians and patients related to those tests requiring preauthorization. Then in August, we entered into a new strategic relationship with Anthem in 12 states. We\u2019re working with Anthem to improve quality and efficiency in delivery of laboratory services. Then finally, additionally we\u2019re working with major national payors to enable their members to access COVID-19 testing through Quest\u2019s relationships with major retailers.  We made progress on our third element of our strategy to accelerate growth by offering the broadest access to innovation. In the quarter, we launched three new combined COVID-19 and respiratory virus tests, reducing time for physician to diagnose and treat patients by identifying nearly 20 viral and bacterial infections from a single swab. We also launched our automated next generation sequencing solution that enables individuals to access genetic testing insights about hereditary diseases at consumer price points through Ancestry Health.  Finally, we grew our direct-to-consumer services in the quarter. Quest Direct test offerings continue to resonate with consumers. In the quarter, we launched our COVID-19 active infection test, offering consumers a choice of using an at-home kit or getting the specimen collection done at a drive-through location. Also, we made remarkable progress in the surge of sign-ups to our My Quest patient portal. Today, roughly 13 million patients have a My Quest account to make appointments or receive their results through their smartphone or their computer. In the third quarter, on average more than 100,000 patients per week signed up for this service. This is more than double the rate we experienced before the pandemic. Now, the second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence by continuing to pursue our goals to reduce our cost base by 3% per year. We also see more opportunities ahead to drive further productivity gains while at the same time enhancing our customer experience and overall service levels.  Here\u2019s a couple of examples. We have standardized on the Siemens immunoassay platform in 14 of our 18 regional laboratories. The solution drives workflow efficiencies and has enabled more than a 50% reduction in our equipment footprint. We are still in the early stages of these realized savings but so far, we\u2019re pleased with this progress. Then also, our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey is being prepared to go live in early 2021. When complete, this state of the art facility will be the most highly automated in our laboratory network and will represent the final regional lab to be converted to our standard operational system, which we call [indiscernible]. This will mark the culmination of a multi-year initiative to simplify, streamline and standardize our regional laboratory operations.  Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark to take you through the results and update you on our outlook. Mark?\nMark Guinan: Thanks Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.79 billion, up roughly 43% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 44% compared to the prior year, which reflected significant demand for COVID-19 testing services offset by a modest decline in base testing volumes. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 19.7% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 3%.  We continued to experience improving performance in our base business in the third quarter. Orders for organic base testing compared to our pre-pandemic business declined high single digits in July and improved to a mid to high single digit decline in September versus the prior year. For the entire third quarter, base testing volumes declined roughly 5% versus the prior year and benefited from recent M&A and the new PLS [indiscernible] that Steve highlighted earlier.  We also experienced a significant contribution from COVID-19 testing during the third quarter, performing approximately 9.9 million molecular tests and 1.5 million serology tests. We exited the third quarter averaging approximately 93,000 COVID-19 molecular and 11,000 serology tests per day. Revenue per requisition increased 20.9% versus the prior year, driven largely by COVID-19 testing. This was partially offset by unit price headwinds of approximately 1.7% in the third quarter, in line with our prior expectations. This included the ongoing impact of PAMA.  Reported operating income was $718 million or 25.8% of revenues compared to $313 million or 16% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $831 million or 29.8% of revenues compared to $349 million or 17.9% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by strong revenue growth in the third quarter, reflecting the relatively high drop-through on incremental volume in our business.  Reported EPS was $4.14 in the quarter compared to $1.56 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $4.31 compared to $1.76 last year.  Cash provided by operations was approximately $1.46 billion year to date through September 30 versus $895 million in the same period last year. Cash from operations in the third quarter includes approximately $138 million of provider relief under the CARES Act. As a result of our strong financial position, we are planning to return the entire CARES Act funding we received, which Steve noted earlier.  Additionally, we are accelerating the redemption of our senior notes maturing in April of 2021. We will use the proceeds of the bond offering that we completed in May 2020 to repay these notes. We expect to complete the early debt redemption in November. Turning to guidance, we raised our full year 2020 outlook as follows: revenues now expected to be between $8.8 billion and $9.1 billion, an increase of approximately 13.9% to 17.8% versus the prior year; reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.22 to $9.22 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9 to $10; cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.75 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. We continue to operate under the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued recovery in the base business as well as demand for and duration of COVID-19 molecular testing are significant swing factors that remain challenging to forecast. With that high degree of uncertainty in mind, please consider the following: the midpoint of our full year outlook generally assumes base testing volumes to remain modestly below last prior year levels as we exit 2020; COVID-19 testing volumes averaging nearly 90,000 tests per day for the molecular test and 10,000 tests per day for the serology test in Q4; COVID-19 molecular reimbursement generally stable with recent trends. Our performance through mid October is slightly above these assumptions, but again our guidance reflects the uncertainty of the current environment. Finally, as Steve mentioned, we are currently in the early stages of launching our recently announced initiatives with the Quest Foundation to reduce heath disparities in underserved communities. As we move forward, we expect to exclude the costs associated with this multi-year initiative in determining our adjusted results.  While we aren\u2019t prepared to share a detailed outlook for 2021 today, I\u2019d like to offer some considerations for next year. First, we are likely to have an easy compare in our base business for much of the year, especially in Q2. Second, demand for COVID-19 testing is likely to persist well into 2021. We believe that molecular PCR testing will continue to play a very important role in diagnosing, tracking and tracing active COVID-19 infections and that there will eventually be a growing need for serology testing as vaccines and additional therapies come to the market. Third, we are working to understand the details of the recent CMS announcement regarding COVID-19 molecular reimbursement for 2021, and finally as a reminder, there will be no Medicare reimbursement costs under PAMA in 2021 given the one-year delay included in the CARES Act. I will now turn it back to Steve.\nStephen Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. To summarize, we had a very strong third quarter and have performed over 22 million COVID-19 molecular and serology tests to date. We\u2019ve also developed and introduced a number of new innovations allowing the country to get back to work, into the classroom, and onto the athletic fields. We\u2019ve seen further signs of recovery in healthcare utilization as our base testing volume continued to recover rapidly throughout the third quarter. Finally, again I\u2019m extremely proud of all that Quest Diagnostics has accomplished throughout this very difficult time, and I thank all the 42,000 people at Quest Diagnostics for all their hard work and dedication. Now we\u2019d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] The first question is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.\nAnn Hynes: Hi, good morning. How\u2019s everything? I just wanted to touch back on your comments, Mark, about the reimbursement for next year. I know that a lot still is unknown, but just for modeling purposes, maybe can you talk about your current turnaround time, what you expect your molecular capacity to be by that time in January, and should we assume would you need to make any more further investments to be able to get that $100 reimbursement for molecular test?  My second question is just about cash flow - obviously it\u2019s very elevated because of all the testing. What do you expect--how do expect to deploy that once you\u2019re able to, and maybe about timing the cash deployment since it\u2019s very elevated? Thanks.\nStephen Rusckowski: Let me start with the operational piece of that, Ann. First of all, we\u2019re running about a capacity of 200,000 tests per day, even though what you heard from our guidance is less than that in terms of actual results. We\u2019ve done that for two reasons. One is to be prepared for the fall where we\u2019re anticipating further demand for COVID-19 testing, and then secondly is when we have more capacity and we result less, it helps us with turnaround time, so I\u2019m happy to share that right now we\u2019re averaging less than two days for testing for COVID-19. What I\u2019ll also say, as I said in my early introductory remarks, we\u2019re trying to understand the exact guidelines, and I\u2019m sure there will be more detail from CMS In terms of recovery--excuse me, reimbursement changes. When we\u2019re looking at turnaround times, we\u2019re looking at it today from specimen collection to results, and that\u2019s also by calendar day, and there will be more specificity on this from CMS but--you know, there will be more clarity around that.  So we\u2019re performing well with, I think, capacity versus our demand, and we\u2019re not stopping there. We\u2019re actually increasing our capacity as we speak. We\u2019re working out some of the last capacity we can get out of some of the new systems we put in place, and secondly we\u2019re looking at applying pooling to some of our IBB platforms, so that should get us to eventually coming out of this year at 250,000 per day versus the 200,000 today, so we should be able to meet the demand and keep our turnaround times at the level I\u2019ve already indicated. Mark?\nMark Guinan: Yes, so just to add to that, Ann, the devil\u2019s in the details. We need to understand exactly when the clock starts on turnaround time. Based on where we think it should end up, we expect to be in very good shape around meeting the criteria. At this point, assume we have to get more than half of those tests turned around in two days or less, and obviously we need clarification and certainty around that, and that\u2019s for obviously Medicare, and we still also need to work through some of the issues with the commercial payors as well to understand how it\u2019s going to work with them. That\u2019s why we\u2019re cautious in terms of committing too much to what this pronouncement by CMS means. We have a lot of work to do, but certainly we\u2019re optimistic as we look at it that we should be able to meet that requirement. On cash flow, as you see, we\u2019re obviously feeling much better about our cash flow at this point. The fact that we\u2019re repaying the debt early from April that we issued as a pre-issuance in May shows our confidence, returning $138 million which of course is deducted from our projection when I said at least $4.75 billion, so we\u2019re expecting a very strong cash year. You know, Steve mentioned we have a very strong M&A pipeline, and I\u2019ve said many time to investors I would prefer to do M&A because when we do it, we\u2019re highly confident that that\u2019s a better return for our shareholders, but we do have very strict criteria. We have to find deals that meet those criteria, so I\u2019m optimistic that we will deploy a chunk of that for M&A and then at some point you can expect us to return to our normal capital strategy as we move forward throughout the calendar year, or early next year.\nAnn Hynes: Great, thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask you about the progression of core volumes for the quarter. I believe you said August core volumes were down mid to high single digits, and then in today\u2019s release I think it also has the September exit rate at about the same level, down mid singles to high singles. This would seem to suggest that the baseline volume return to normal has slowed a little bit. Is that consistent with what you guys have actually experienced, and if so, what do you think needs to happen to see it improve further? If it\u2019s not, what\u2019s the nuance that I\u2019m missing? Then just to put a final point on it, does guidance assume you see a continuing improvement from the September exit rate or basically a continuation at that level? Thank you.\nMark Guinan: Thanks for the question, Stephen. As we mentioned, volume improved from July, so really September versus August is fairly flat, so yes, there was a little stagnation in improvement in the baseline, not completely surprising given the recent uptick in COVID again. So it hasn\u2019t gotten worse for us, but it did not continue its improvement, and that\u2019s why when I talked about what we expect in Q4, we don\u2019t expect a full recovery any time this calendar year. Obviously we have a very broad range - $300 million, so within that range there\u2019s multi variables, but in terms of the base business, we\u2019re not counting on in the middle of that a complete recovery. We\u2019re not expecting it to move materially away from where it\u2019s been the last couple months, but that would kind of get you to that lower end and upper end of the range, depending on that along, of course, with COVID testing as well, where they go from that midpoint. So not counting on anything, but certainly improvement could lead us toward that upper end, and if it eroded a little bit, it could lead us towards the lower end of our guidance.\nStephen Rusckowski: Yes, and we\u2019re watching that carefully. If you go back and hear what I said, we started off July at high single digits, and then also as I indicated in September, it was mid to high, so slight improvement there but we\u2019re watching it as we enter the fourth quarter and as we sit here in the fourth quarter in October.\nOperator: The next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning. I have a question on the gross margins. You came in meaningfully higher than us - clearly we\u2019re seeing the benefits of the return of core volumes. But can you maybe help us quantify, off the gross margin that we saw in the quarter, what is coming from the return of core versus realized price for COVID testing? We understand the reimbursement, but also we\u2019re hearing you talk a lot more about direct-to-consumer testing, which I\u2019m assuming comes with a higher price point, so if we can just get a little bit more clarity on that.\nMark Guinan: Sure, so Ricky, first I\u2019ll confirm that direct-to-consumer does come with a higher price point. Certainly there are other expenses that go with direct-to-consumer. We\u2019ve actually invested incrementally in some marketing to drive awareness and so on, but from a gross margin perspective, the consumer testing is higher than our core business. Recall even though we feel good about that business, it\u2019s still a very small part of our overall enterprise. Then between COVID and base, obviously we don\u2019t get into gross margin on specific test offerings, but the one benefit I will point out on COVID is that there\u2019s no patient responsibility, so when you think about it - and I don\u2019t have the precise numbers, but just let\u2019s say because our overall enterprise, about 20% of our revenues come from patients, if we collect, as we\u2019ve shared, $0.70 on the dollar, you can imagine that there is about a 6% higher margin on that particular business because it\u2019s 100 reimbursed by payors instead of having any patient responsibility, so there is some benefit to the gross margin. But in COVID, it really is unrelated to price and really has everything to do with the coverage policies and not having that inability to collect all the money that we\u2019re due.\nRicky Goldwasser: Great, and just one follow-up, if I may. You gave us some early puts and takes for 2021. We\u2019re starting to hear some companies that are accelerating hiring in preparation for next year. When you think about increasing first serology associated with COVID vaccines, etc., should we assume a step-up in costs related to increased hiring in preparation for that?\nStephen Rusckowski: Yes, so Ricky we managed our workforce carefully over the last six to nine months. As you\u2019ll recall, the second quarter we had to trim down our workforce, so we furloughed over 6,000 people, we reduced work schedules, we cut salaries including myself and Mark and our board, and then we saw the steady recovery in our base business coupled with the COVID testing that we\u2019ve done.  So we\u2019ve reinstated salaries, we have brought back full work weeks and we\u2019ve brought back the vast majority of the furloughed employees, and actually we\u2019ve hired people, so we\u2019ve hired people where we need to hire people, particularly in areas like specimen processing. You can see with the volumes we\u2019re seeing, you have to have a lot of people to receive all these specimens to sort it out before they go into the lab. But I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re still being very, very careful before we add another person. We\u2019re being very careful in overhead, and Mark can go through exactly what\u2019s in our expenses, but we\u2019ve been very limited in hiring in our expense categories and will continue to be very [indiscernible] with our hiring for our overhead with our laboratory operations and our operations in general. The reason for that is we want to make sure we don\u2019t\u2019 get ahead of ourselves. We feel we got good leverage in the third quarter, as you see, and we believe we have a workforce in place to manage the demand we\u2019re getting right now. We\u2019re constantly looking at what we think the future demand will be, but we want to make sure we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves. We indicated what we think the fourth quarter\u2019s going to be. We are building capacity to get more COVID-19 testing done. We have plenty of capacity available for serology without adding a lot of staff, with the exception of some of the volume based jobs as I mentioned, and so as we get deeper into the fourth quarter and we get into the beginning of next year, we\u2019ll then assess if we need to add some people. But so far, we\u2019ve done some modest hiring, we\u2019re back to full workforce, and we\u2019re watching it, frankly, daily and we want to make sure we don\u2019t add people before we need them.\nMark Guinan: Yes, so we don\u2019t have any proactive plans to add resources, Ricky. We\u2019re going to continue to monitor demand in our business, and we have the flexibility generally to ramp in a fairly short window as volumes move in one direction or the other. I can confirm no plan to add to the expense base in Q4 in anticipation of anything next year at this point.\nStephen Rusckowski: And interestingly enough, this is a last point because we do have this natural hedge on this, is despite where we are with the economy, we still have attrition in some of our draws, so we\u2019re in some places still trying to keep up. There are other options for people particularly with some of our non-exempt employment jobs, and therefore if things turn down, we could carefully turn off our spigot as well.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is now open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great, thanks. Good morning. I want to go back to the reimbursement comments, and specifically in your prepared remarks on the CMS reimbursement tweak and it removing an overhang. I guess I just want to be clear on what the expectation is now, sort of post the PHE period, assuming you meet those turnaround times. Does it sustain the $100 level, am I interpreting that right or not?  And then second piece is related just post that PHE period, my understanding is the commercial rate for COVID will be the default to your contracted rate, or there\u2019s a rate negotiation that takes place. Is that correct, and then how should we think of that commercial rate off the $100 baseline? Thanks. \nStephen Rusckowski: Yes, so let me start with where we saw some uncertainty and therefore the word we used, overhang. First of all, for this year we had some uncertainty, as you know, in the third quarter about the emergency order that\u2019s in place, and that was extended to October. We are hopeful that the rate would continue at $100, and it\u2019s our expectation given that the new rate changes with the incentive that we outlined [indiscernible] on January, so therefore we\u2019re assuming the $100 for reimbursement for the remainder of this year. But up until we heard this, there was some uncertainty about 2020. Then secondly, in 2021 remember the original rate was at $51 and it went up to $100, and so therefore the new reimbursement that\u2019s being spoken of, again if you get the turnaround time of two days, you\u2019re at $100, if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s $75, so that removes some of that uncertainty of it reverting back to where it was before we got the bump from $51 to $100.  Mark, do you want to take it on the commercial side?\nMark Guinan: Yes, generally it\u2019s a renegotiation, Ralph. We had provisions in our contracts for new tests, and certainly the high throughput COVID-19 molecular test is one of those, so there is no provision for it to default automatically to any sort of relationship to CMS or what have you. We had to negotiate that, and I was successful in getting it to match CMS\u2019 rate, and certainly as we go forward we\u2019re going to have to continue to talk to our commercial payors and negotiate. There\u2019s no set answer at this point to where commercial reimbursement might go.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is now open.\nJack Meehan: Hey, good morning. Wanted to dig in a little bit on the commentary around core volumes. Just a clarification first - I think you said the core was down mid single digits. Does that include M&A, just to bridge versus the monthly commentary? Then as you look out to 2021, do you think routine demand can return to the pre-COVID baseline or is there some reason why you think it might struggle to get back to 100%?\nMark Guinan: The core volumes, I want to be clear, for the quarter were mid to high single digits with an improvement from July into August, and then fairly flat in September, and that was an apples to apples comparison, so M&A puts those core volumes in a better place and then also some of the new POS deals. But we didn\u2019t want to confound utilization by just reporting the base business. We wanted you to understand the apples to apples, almost same store analysis, and that\u2019s the one where we\u2019re down mid to slightly higher single digits for the full quarter. In terms of next year, like everybody else, we\u2019re trying to figure out how quickly things might recover and to what extent. We\u2019re looking at all the same reports you are. Given the continued [indiscernible] utilization given the potential for the economy to have impact on utilization and other uncertainties, at this point we\u2019re not expecting any time soon to get the base volume back to the pre-pandemic levels, but with that said, it doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t happen. We\u2019re just not at this point assuming it, and while we haven\u2019t given guidance for 2021, we wanted to just give some of our initial thinking. But obviously when we come out with guidance, we\u2019re going to give you specifics around what those assumptions are, and at that point we\u2019ll have a lot more information.\nStephen Rusckowski: Some color around--you know, we\u2019ve got variation around geography and around clinical franchises, so by way of example, New York City has still not recovered and we have a fair business in New York, so if you look at the percentage overall that\u2019s affected by New York not recovering. There\u2019s other parts of the country that are fully recovered, so we\u2019re watching that carefully and we\u2019re watching it by city. If things change by city or state, we can understand the consequence of that.  Then secondly, we\u2019ve got some clinical franchises that are back to pre-pandemic levels but we still have the laggers. We have our prescription drug monitoring business which is still below pre-pandemic levels, so if you look at it from a couple different dimensions, you can understand why we\u2019re below pre-pandemic, and then what it takes to get back to where we were going into 2020 and potentially get above it, it will require some of these areas to get back to normal levels that we saw in the winter months, before we hit the pandemic in March. \nMark Guinan: To Steve\u2019s point, there is a lot of complexity. We actually do have some geographies that are growing year over year, and then we have some like--and it\u2019s really [indiscernible]. If you look at Long Island, you look at Westchester County, you look at New Jersey right outside of Manhattan, they\u2019re in much better shape than Manhattan is, and we aren\u2019t sure whether that has anything to do with physician office and so on. We think it might be fewer commuters going into the city, they\u2019re getting their work done elsewhere instead of while they\u2019re at work during the day. But certainly we don\u2019t have any specific information on that at this point.\nOperator: The next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks for the question. Overall, how are you thinking about the competitive dynamics between the point-of-care rapid testing capabilities in your COVID offerings, or should we be thinking about it as testing to get testing in this sort of environment? Then I guess a broader question here too, how are you thinking about consumer behavior when it comes to diagnostic testing in a post-COVID world? Will this inherently expedite some of your direct-to-consumer initiatives here, or does it change or affect any of those efforts, such as Quest Direct and other consumer initiatives, and will this be dramatically more meaningful from a financial perspective for you in the coming years? Thanks.\nStephen Rusckowski: Yes, thanks. I\u2019ll take the first part around point-of-care solutions. As you know, there\u2019s two point-of-care solutions. One of the point-of-care diagnostic solutions that were out there for some time provided by IBD manufacturers, and for all intents and purposes they were there for a number of months and they provided a role. Then most recently, I believe you are referring to what\u2019s happening with the antigen testing. We do believe there will be a role for antigen testing, particularly for monitoring and surveillance of a population. But we do understand for a lot of reasons why PCR and the return to the lab model is going to continue to be the gold standard. One of the reasons for that, depending upon the quality of the antigen testing that might be applied, there are requirements around reflex testing to PCR for both positives and negatives, and also we believe that physicians do prefer PCR testing, and when we\u2019re offered, it means flu respiratory panel and COVID tests that will be a PCR, and we think with the flu season coming out that we are going to get some demand for it as well. So we believe that antigen testing will be a necessary part of our portfolio and we do expect to be bringing out a solution for antigen testing as part of our services we offer, but it will be complementary to the PCR testing that we\u2019re currently doing. Hopefully that provides some clarity of what we think the role will be. Then finally on the consumer piece, we do believe that there is increased interest in our direct-to-consumer offerings for the basic testing. As you all know, a number of patients have not gone to their doctors as they should. We do believe there is an opportunity for them to have their lipid panel checked for their cholesterol, make sure the statins are working properly - you know, [indiscernible] glucose A1c, sexually transmitted diseases. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve brought up serology testing direct to consumer and most recently COVID-19 testing. We believe there is interest in a very convenient approach to getting testing, and we couple this with a telehealth physician consult as part of our service and we do believe going forward, there is going to be increased demand for both telehealth in terms of its role in our business overall, and then secondly is testing and getting that either indirectly through Quest Direct or getting that through a telehealth provider as well. We\u2019re very well positioned in that regard with our relationships with telehealth companies but also with Quest Direct. Before the pandemic, we kicked this program off, and so we have a nice platform that\u2019s been building up volume and we feel that there\u2019s going to be more opportunities in front of us as the demand, given the circumstances, continues to have a lot of interest from consumers. \nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Donald Hooker from Keybanc. Your line is now open.\nDonald Hooker: Great, good morning. There\u2019s a lot being talked about here, a lot of topics, but one thing that jumped out for me in your prepared remarks was the record bookings in POS. I was wondering if it\u2019s possible to maybe size or scope that. I suspect I know why that might be the case, but I\u2019d also love to hear your perspective on what you think is going on there, if it speaks to maybe the health of the hospital environment as well. \nStephen Rusckowski: Yes, well we\u2019re encouraged. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the hospital business is actually growing again versus last year, and that\u2019s encouraging, and that\u2019s without COVID-19, so that\u2019s an encouraging trend. We see hospitals back in business and we\u2019re seeing the testing that you would expect from those hospitals, and we\u2019re doing well in that marketplace. This is where what we traditionally called our reference testing business. Then in addition to this, over the years we have built up a professional lab services business. This isn\u2019t just a new program - we\u2019ve been working on this for over five or six years, and we\u2019ve built up a nice portfolio of referenceable accounts and that\u2019s serving us well. We are penning a number of long term, multi-year contracts this year that will provide growth for us in \u201921 for certain, and we see continued growing interest from integrated delivery systems on how we can help them with their lab strategy. As you know, many of these hospital systems are having a difficult time through the pandemic, and now speaking with many of the CEOs, and I actually had a conversation Tuesday with one, they\u2019re looking at a variety of options to get more efficient, get more effective. One of the areas that we\u2019ve talked about for years, and I think it\u2019s going to keep building momentum, is walking in and having a conversation around their lab strategy, which includes the reference testing, the sophisticate testing they send out, how it can help save their money through the acute care laboratory. Then it does beg the question of what they do with their outreach business, and in some cases they sell that to us, and that\u2019s what we did with Memorial Hermann this year, with MACL, and we\u2019re seeing more and more prospects.  So it continues to receive strong interest, and this year was really a banner year for bookings, and we\u2019ll see that in the growth in \u201921. Mark, anything you\u2019d like to add to that?\nMark Guinan: Yes Don, as you know, we don\u2019t generally prospectively announce the size of a contract, but what we will see as we report our quarterly results and we talk about our growth and where it\u2019s coming from, the POS contribution, so certainly moving forward you\u2019re going to see the evidence of what Steve just talked about in some of these very large bookings and deals that we\u2019re just starting to implement and that will accelerate our growth into 2021.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is now open.\nKevin Caliendo: Hey guys. I have a two-part question here. I guess I don\u2019t understand why you expect COVID volumes to be down from your current levels given COVID is likely to increase - we\u2019re already seeing the outbreaks for the 4Q. But even if they are, like just say it\u2019s 90 versus the 100 pace that we\u2019re at now, the margin assumption for 4Q is still meaningfully lower. Maybe Ricky was asking about this earlier, but is there any additional costs - bonuses or anything that maybe you\u2019re going to do in the fourth quarter that you didn\u2019t do a year ago, that would suggest the margin sequentially falling, given your guidance?\nMark Guinan: Yes, so I did not intend to imply that PCR volumes will be reduced in Q4. Actually the midpoint of the guidance assumes it stays where it is, where we are right now, and as I shared, through the first couple of weeks of October we\u2019re actually slightly ahead of the midpoint of guidance. I wanted to clarify that. In terms of margin, really nothing of significance. We did have in Q3 a significant catch-up expense on our bonus. As I\u2019m sure you could imagine, early in the year we were projecting to significantly miss our targets, and then Q3 really reversed that and got us to a point where we\u2019re expected to exceed our targets, so in Q4 we would just have, assuming we deliver, the Q4 proportion of that.  So actually, there was in Q3 a significant incremental expense to catch up our bonuses that will not be repeated in Q4, so there\u2019s nothing of huge significance other than there are some of the cost actions that Steve referenced that we have reinstated to normalcy, so we did have some reductions in July on salaries and in Q4, those will be fully to where they were pre-pandemic, and then we did reinstate the 401K match late in Q3 and that will be fully reinstated in Q4. So there are a couple of what I\u2019d call headwinds, but those are really just returning us to pre-pandemic levels, and then normally in Q4 we just have some other margin pressures, given the holidays and some other things that we manage through, but nothing of note. Finally, there is a small amount of incremental investment. I referenced on the things that we\u2019re doing around supporting our consumer business. We want to continue to build that business. We think it\u2019s going to be increasingly important, and so we do have the opportunity given our business performance to invest, and so there\u2019s a little bit of commercial investment into our consumer business that\u2019s a step up from where it\u2019s been in Q3.\nOperator: The next question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nPito Chickering: Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions.  Two quick ones for you. Now that you\u2019ve more experience with the preferred lab networks, what leverage do you think plays a bigger impact with changing consumer behavior? Is it the zero co-pays for the consumer or is it the lower admin burden from the referral sources? Also a quick follow-up on the core organic volumes - you mentioned seeing geographic pressure in New York City. Is geographic weakness a primary driver that you\u2019re seeing across your book of business, or is it more broad-based specialties like Pantox that haven\u2019t recovered yet? Thanks so much.\nStephen Rusckowski: We continue to work on our relationship with UnitedHealthcare. As we said, in \u201919 we made some really good progress picking up share related to the PLN. We had a lot of things to do in the fall of 2019 related to employers, zero out of pocket and preauthorization work, and we really felt good about January and February. We actually did see a nice progression of our volumes and then we hit the pandemic in March.  We continue to work those programs and matter of fact, this week I was spending time with United on this and we continue to work on everything we can do to move more of their lab purchases to the PLN, and obviously specifically to us, and there will be other programs that we\u2019re working with them by geography, by state to be able to make sure that employers and patients and integrated delivery systems understand the value of what we deliver. Remember if you go back to where we started, we believe that by the improvement in access with United and Verizon and Anthem in Georgia as of the time of our last investor day, it afforded us about a $4 billion opportunity in market, and we believe that we should be able to get about 25% of that. We received some of that in 2019 and we believe there\u2019s more opportunity in front of us. So what I can share with you is we continue that work in 2020 and we do expect it will continue to help us pick up some share in \u201921 to accelerate our growth.\nMark Guinan: I just want to remind everyone, Pito, that the zero out of pocket still has a ways to go, so they started with their fully insured small plans and then expanded it, and then it\u2019s going to go out to the sponsored plans. Obviously that\u2019s marketed to the employers who are paying those bills, and the good news is we\u2019re collaborating with them on that and trying to demonstrate how that will save the employers a whole lot of money. To this point, most of the movement has been through other activity, things that United has done to encourage physicians to stop using out-of-network providers, having us go in and show them the benefits of moving that lab ordering to us and the PLN member, but still a lot of runway in front of us in terms of how that might benefit. The lower burden is really just a new thing. We\u2019re putting in some pretty significant requirements around some of the higher cost testing, and they realize that two things - one is that the PLN members can really have more responsible panels or an approach to clinical testing. The second thing is obviously we have good prices as compared to some of the other providers, and we\u2019ve mentioned in the past that some of the managed Medicaid payors, so outside of United, have used this approach in specifically toxicology to drive better value. You know, with toxicology exploding over the last couple years, they put in some very tight restrictions on utilization, and seeing that the national labs tend to do this responsibly and have better prices, they exempted us from a pre-auth. So not only does it make it easier on physicians and patients, but it tends to steer more work to us because the administrative burden is lower. United sees that in the same areas where they\u2019re trying to control some of the growth in high cost testing, but that benefit to us is to come yet.\nOperator: Next question is from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nMatt Larew: Good morning. We\u2019re in the early weeks of the traditional flu season, so I had a couple questions. First, what are your expectations going in with respect to potentially higher vaccine rates or social distancing? What are you hearing from physicians about approaches to flu versus potentially flu with COVID, or flu-RSV-COVID combos in symptomatic versus asymptomatic, and then what are you hearing about with respect to reimbursement on those combo offerings versus the individual analytes? Thanks.\nStephen Rusckowski: Matt, we\u2019re watching it carefully. We believe that when somebody presents themselves with symptoms, they want to rule out COVID, and we believe that PCR testing will be the option. As we mentioned, we brought out a new solution which we feel really good about - with a single swab, you can test for influenza, you can also test for other viral and bacterial issues, and that is going to be very convenient for physicians just to quickly diagnose and then treat the patients effectively.  Now what you bring up, we\u2019re watching it carefully because with all of us being socially distant and all of us doing a better job of hygiene and schools not being entirely back in session, it might actually lower the infection rate this year, but we\u2019re not certain of that, and so we\u2019re watching that. Mark, do you want to talk about reimbursement for some of the--\nMark Guinan: Yes, you know, it\u2019s still to be determined. Basically for reference, CPT code 87631, which is the respiratory multiplex panel with three to five targets is $142 today; 87632, with six to 11 targets, is $218, and then 87631 reflux with 12 to 25 targets is $416, so still to be determined exactly where we come out on this. Still have negotiations with the commercial payors, but at least we could reference in the past for some of these multiplex panels, you know, the reimbursement is reasonable. \nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Next question is from Brian Tanquilut. Your line is now open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys, and congrats on a good quarter.  I guess my question to you guys, you talked about serology and how that plays into the 2021 outlook. How are you thinking about the ramp of that, and what are the conversations right now with payors on potential coverage or likely coverage for serology once the vaccine is out?\nStephen Rusckowski: Yes, we\u2019re doing our share of serology, running around 10,000 per day. We\u2019ve got plenty of capacity in front of us. We believe it\u2019s going to play an increasingly important role as we get into 2021, as the vaccine becomes available. We\u2019re actively engaged with those pharmaceutical companies that are doing the trials for the vaccine and trying to understand where we might play a role [indiscernible] either with the vaccine or post vaccine, and serology has a role there.  We\u2019re also doing some serology population health testing. We\u2019ve done some work for states and we\u2019re doing work for the CDC, and we believe that that work will continue to give us a good handle on what is happening with the progression of disease and have an early warning signal if we\u2019re moving in the wrong direction, so more to come. We\u2019re working through that. We do believe it\u2019s going to be a growing and bigger opportunity in 2021 and more visibility of that as we understand where the vaccine is, understand the progression of where we are with the pandemic.  Then also, we will be bringing new solutions out to the marketplace that will provide more and more utility around serology, and more to come on that. But we\u2019re working on the science and we believe there\u2019s more we can do to contribute towards the pandemic as we go, particularly as we see how the pandemic progresses.\nMark Guinan: In terms of discussions with the payors, it\u2019s still early, Brian. There is not clarity around the exact role that serology is going to play, and while we believe there is going to be an important role, it\u2019s not at a point where we\u2019re in detailed discussions with the payors yet.\nOperator: The next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDerik de Bruin: Hey, great. Thanks for fitting me in. Just a question, a quick question on the impact on the business from pooling. How much of the samples are being pooled right now, and what are the economics on that and the reimbursement for that? How much is your cost savings, and I guess how much of the volumes do you think can ultimately be pooled, realizing the fact is you\u2019ve got to have low pandemic areas to do it. Just your thoughts on that for the business.\nStephen Rusckowski: Yes, sure. Remember we talked about 200,000 tests per day for capacity, and [indiscernible] resulted in the third quarter about 100,000 per day. Roughly 20% to 25% of that volume is done on what we call our LDTs, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been leveraging the pooling capability. It\u2019s particularly useful. It has good improvements in productivity and efficiency where you have low prevalence populations because when you do the pooling, when one well lights up, you have to test for that well, and you get a few 14, 15% positivity rates in locations, the mask doesn\u2019t mark it out any more, so we\u2019re applying it in the right way. It\u2019s primarily around our LDT portion of our capacity. What I mentioned in earlier comments was we\u2019re looking at applying that to our IBD platform as well, and that will be helpful in moving our capacity from 200 up to 250.\nMark Guinan: Yes, and just to remind everyone, as Steve said, the efficiency is really highly dependent on the positivity rate, and while we do save on reagents, it\u2019s not an order of magnitude less expensive. The real economic benefit of pooling comes from capacity increase, so our ability to do more testing and the margins we get on that testing, not a huge difference. There is a benefit but not a huge difference in the cost per individual test that we pool.\nOperator: The next question is from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nLisa Gill: Good morning. I just want to go back to the guidance that Mark gave, or kind of preliminary thoughts for 2021, and just understand a couple things a little bit better. When we think about the base business, what\u2019s your expectation around unemployment trends, and as we think about the near term, what we\u2019ve seen in the last few months, do think that unemployment is having any impact on your core volume? Then secondly, when we think about COVID and we think about PCR testing persisting into 2021, do we think about that just in the first part of the year, and when we think about a potential vaccine, what are your thoughts around PCR testing? I understand your comments around serology, but how do we think about PCR testing playing into a vaccine?\nStephen Rusckowski: Mark, you want to start with \u201921 comments and the economy?\nMark Guinan: Yes, so Lisa, it\u2019s hard to know specifically what\u2019s driving the dampened utilization. Certainly things have opened up a lot more than they were in the spring, so whereas physician offices were closed, I think there was a huge fear in a large part of the population around engaging with the healthcare system at all because of the risk potentially of catching COVID when you went into a physician office. While I wouldn\u2019t suggest that\u2019s eliminated, certainly that has improved dramatically, so there is some overhang left there certainly but the unemployment rate is probably a contributor right now - we don\u2019t know for certain, and we wouldn\u2019t expect that to change dramatically certainly in the next six months, or who knows how long before it might turn around. So we\u2019re being cautious around our thinking for next year, and we wanted to share that. Obviously people will form their own opinions, but we would expect unemployment to have some dampening on utilization going into next year.  In terms of the COVID volumes, we haven\u2019t modeled and we haven\u2019t given guidance for \u201921, but maybe three, six months ago some of us had hoped that COVID might be behind us this calendar year. Clearly, that does not look like it\u2019s going to happen, but all this depends on how quickly the vaccines get rolled out, how effective they are, and even once they get rolled out, we see a role, so whether it\u2019s a level of testing we\u2019re seeing today or something a little less, we expect there to be a meaningful amount of COVID testing, including the PCR testing throughout a reasonable part of next year.\nStephen Rusckowski: Yes, and just to add to that, remember with the economy, and we saw this back in the Great Recession, whatever happens to the economy will affect access, and so access is important to us [indiscernible]. Second is consumer confidence, and we know a large portion of the population is paying for healthcare out of their own pocket, and therefore they\u2019re going to think twice about utilizing it, so we are thinking about that as we think about models in \u201921. Now with that said, if you look at where we are with our base business versus where it was and you think about the math for the full year, it should be an easy comparison, as Mark said in his comments about \u201921. Even if it\u2019s down versus \u201919, just to look at the comparison of what the full year will be for \u201920 versus \u201921, given where we are right now, that makes for an easy comparison. As far as PCR, remember we brought out our first PCR test on March 9 and we\u2019ve been ramping rapidly, so we have not had a full year from PCR. We\u2019re hitting our stride, we\u2019re building capacity because we do anticipate more demand, winter is coming and we\u2019re all anticipating more demand as we enter the winter, clearly in the first quarter, and then we\u2019ll start to see hopefully some of the vaccines. As we all know, those won\u2019t be broadly deployed immediately and the pandemic and the virus will be with us for a large portion of \u201921, so if you think about the full year of \u201921 for COVID-19 versus what we did in 2020, there\u2019s still going to be a lot of volume for testing and you have the full 12 months versus essentially a half year for PCR in 2020. It\u2019s something to think about as you do your models.\nMark Guinan: Yes, and to Steve\u2019s point, for this year based on our guidance expectations, we see our base volume down organically in the high teens, so even if it\u2019s down a couple hundred basis points in 2021, it will still be an easy compare for the full year.\nOperator: The last question is from Mike Newshel with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nMike Newshel: Thank you. Going back to the geographic differences on the core volume rebound you mentioned, just wondering if you\u2019re seeing fluctuations tied specifically to where there are new COVID outbreaks. Is there patient behavior changing and affecting the core business when cases spike [indiscernible] or is that variation just more correlated to how far along local economies are into reopening? Is there volatility at a local level or is it just some states are bouncing back faster than others? \nStephen Rusckowski: Well you know, it\u2019s by states, really the big four states. California shut down first, we saw a steady rebound, they\u2019re still not back to pre-pandemic levels, particularly in some of the large cities like LA. If you go into Texas, we actually saw a good rebound in Texas. We have a great presence in Texas, both in Houston and Dallas, and despite some of the flare-ups we saw in the summer, they still continue to be in the range of where we were pre-pandemic. Look at Florida - it went down in the spring into the summer, there\u2019s still issues in Florida. We\u2019re still not where they were pre-pandemic. Then if you go to the northeast, New York and Boston and Connecticut, actually we\u2019ve seen some nice steady recovery with the exception of, as we\u2019ve indicated earlier, New York City, but specific to the Borough of Manhattan. We still have a ways to go to recover there, so we\u2019re watching those, particularly related to infection rates.  But where we have had some of these flare-ups, interesting enough, like in the States of Texas and Florida in the summer months, it did not have a negative of a consequence to our base business as we saw back in the spring, so we\u2019re watching it carefully. But so far, we\u2019re getting there. Then again, you can\u2019t ignore that clinical franchise element of this because some of the portion of the buy-in effects are related to these specific businesses, like prescription drug monitoring, and there\u2019s other issues related to what it takes to get those back to pre-pandemic levels that are not related to the geography at all. \nMark Guinan: I can\u2019t say they\u2019re precisely negatively correlated, but actually that would be my representation. Areas with the lowest positivity rates, like New York, actually are down the most, so we haven\u2019t seen a huge parallel movement between spikes in COVID over the last several months and a downturn in utilization. It actually has kind of gone in the opposite direction. \nShawn Bevec: Okay, so thank you all for your questions. We appreciate your support on this call today and in general, and we wish you all a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics third quarter 2020 conference call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Guinan",
            "content": "Thanks Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.79 billion, up roughly 43% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 44% compared to the prior year, which reflected significant demand for COVID-19 testing services offset by a modest decline in base testing volumes. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 19.7% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 3%.  We continued to experience improving performance in our base business in the third quarter. Orders for organic base testing compared to our pre-pandemic business declined high single digits in July and improved to a mid to high single digit decline in September versus the prior year. For the entire third quarter, base testing volumes declined roughly 5% versus the prior year and benefited from recent M&A and the new PLS [indiscernible] that Steve highlighted earlier.  We also experienced a significant contribution from COVID-19 testing during the third quarter, performing approximately 9.9 million molecular tests and 1.5 million serology tests. We exited the third quarter averaging approximately 93,000 COVID-19 molecular and 11,000 serology tests per day. Revenue per requisition increased 20.9% versus the prior year, driven largely by COVID-19 testing. This was partially offset by unit price headwinds of approximately 1.7% in the third quarter, in line with our prior expectations. This included the ongoing impact of PAMA.  Reported operating income was $718 million or 25.8% of revenues compared to $313 million or 16% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $831 million or 29.8% of revenues compared to $349 million or 17.9% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was driven by strong revenue growth in the third quarter, reflecting the relatively high drop-through on incremental volume in our business.  Reported EPS was $4.14 in the quarter compared to $1.56 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $4.31 compared to $1.76 last year.  Cash provided by operations was approximately $1.46 billion year to date through September 30 versus $895 million in the same period last year. Cash from operations in the third quarter includes approximately $138 million of provider relief under the CARES Act. As a result of our strong financial position, we are planning to return the entire CARES Act funding we received, which Steve noted earlier.  Additionally, we are accelerating the redemption of our senior notes maturing in April of 2021. We will use the proceeds of the bond offering that we completed in May 2020 to repay these notes. We expect to complete the early debt redemption in November. Turning to guidance, we raised our full year 2020 outlook as follows: revenues now expected to be between $8.8 billion and $9.1 billion, an increase of approximately 13.9% to 17.8% versus the prior year; reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.22 to $9.22 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9 to $10; cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.75 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. We continue to operate under the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued recovery in the base business as well as demand for and duration of COVID-19 molecular testing are significant swing factors that remain challenging to forecast. With that high degree of uncertainty in mind, please consider the following: the midpoint of our full year outlook generally assumes base testing volumes to remain modestly below last prior year levels as we exit 2020; COVID-19 testing volumes averaging nearly 90,000 tests per day for the molecular test and 10,000 tests per day for the serology test in Q4; COVID-19 molecular reimbursement generally stable with recent trends. Our performance through mid October is slightly above these assumptions, but again our guidance reflects the uncertainty of the current environment. Finally, as Steve mentioned, we are currently in the early stages of launching our recently announced initiatives with the Quest Foundation to reduce heath disparities in underserved communities. As we move forward, we expect to exclude the costs associated with this multi-year initiative in determining our adjusted results.  While we aren't prepared to share a detailed outlook for 2021 today, I'd like to offer some considerations for next year. First, we are likely to have an easy compare in our base business for much of the year, especially in Q2. Second, demand for COVID-19 testing is likely to persist well into 2021. We believe that molecular PCR testing will continue to play a very important role in diagnosing, tracking and tracing active COVID-19 infections and that there will eventually be a growing need for serology testing as vaccines and additional therapies come to the market. Third, we are working to understand the details of the recent CMS announcement regarding COVID-19 molecular reimbursement for 2021, and finally as a reminder, there will be no Medicare reimbursement costs under PAMA in 2021 given the one-year delay included in the CARES Act. I will now turn it back to Steve. Yes, so just to add to that, Ann, the devil's in the details. We need to understand exactly when the clock starts on turnaround time. Based on where we think it should end up, we expect to be in very good shape around meeting the criteria. At this point, assume we have to get more than half of those tests turned around in two days or less, and obviously we need clarification and certainty around that, and that's for obviously Medicare, and we still also need to work through some of the issues with the commercial payors as well to understand how it's going to work with them. That's why we're cautious in terms of committing too much to what this pronouncement by CMS means. We have a lot of work to do, but certainly we're optimistic as we look at it that we should be able to meet that requirement. On cash flow, as you see, we're obviously feeling much better about our cash flow at this point. The fact that we're repaying the debt early from April that we issued as a pre-issuance in May shows our confidence, returning $138 million which of course is deducted from our projection when I said at least $4.75 billion, so we're expecting a very strong cash year. You know, Steve mentioned we have a very strong M&A pipeline, and I've said many time to investors I would prefer to do M&A because when we do it, we're highly confident that that's a better return for our shareholders, but we do have very strict criteria. We have to find deals that meet those criteria, so I'm optimistic that we will deploy a chunk of that for M&A and then at some point you can expect us to return to our normal capital strategy as we move forward throughout the calendar year, or early next year. Thanks for the question, Stephen. As we mentioned, volume improved from July, so really September versus August is fairly flat, so yes, there was a little stagnation in improvement in the baseline, not completely surprising given the recent uptick in COVID again. So it hasn't gotten worse for us, but it did not continue its improvement, and that's why when I talked about what we expect in Q4, we don't expect a full recovery any time this calendar year. Obviously we have a very broad range - $300 million, so within that range there's multi variables, but in terms of the base business, we're not counting on in the middle of that a complete recovery. We're not expecting it to move materially away from where it's been the last couple months, but that would kind of get you to that lower end and upper end of the range, depending on that along, of course, with COVID testing as well, where they go from that midpoint. So not counting on anything, but certainly improvement could lead us toward that upper end, and if it eroded a little bit, it could lead us towards the lower end of our guidance. Sure, so Ricky, first I'll confirm that direct-to-consumer does come with a higher price point. Certainly there are other expenses that go with direct-to-consumer. We've actually invested incrementally in some marketing to drive awareness and so on, but from a gross margin perspective, the consumer testing is higher than our core business. Recall even though we feel good about that business, it's still a very small part of our overall enterprise. Then between COVID and base, obviously we don't get into gross margin on specific test offerings, but the one benefit I will point out on COVID is that there's no patient responsibility, so when you think about it - and I don't have the precise numbers, but just let's say because our overall enterprise, about 20% of our revenues come from patients, if we collect, as we've shared, $0.70 on the dollar, you can imagine that there is about a 6% higher margin on that particular business because it's 100 reimbursed by payors instead of having any patient responsibility, so there is some benefit to the gross margin. But in COVID, it really is unrelated to price and really has everything to do with the coverage policies and not having that inability to collect all the money that we're due. Yes, so we don't have any proactive plans to add resources, Ricky. We're going to continue to monitor demand in our business, and we have the flexibility generally to ramp in a fairly short window as volumes move in one direction or the other. I can confirm no plan to add to the expense base in Q4 in anticipation of anything next year at this point. Yes, generally it's a renegotiation, Ralph. We had provisions in our contracts for new tests, and certainly the high throughput COVID-19 molecular test is one of those, so there is no provision for it to default automatically to any sort of relationship to CMS or what have you. We had to negotiate that, and I was successful in getting it to match CMS' rate, and certainly as we go forward we're going to have to continue to talk to our commercial payors and negotiate. There's no set answer at this point to where commercial reimbursement might go. The core volumes, I want to be clear, for the quarter were mid to high single digits with an improvement from July into August, and then fairly flat in September, and that was an apples to apples comparison, so M&A puts those core volumes in a better place and then also some of the new POS deals. But we didn't want to confound utilization by just reporting the base business. We wanted you to understand the apples to apples, almost same store analysis, and that's the one where we're down mid to slightly higher single digits for the full quarter. In terms of next year, like everybody else, we're trying to figure out how quickly things might recover and to what extent. We're looking at all the same reports you are. Given the continued [indiscernible] utilization given the potential for the economy to have impact on utilization and other uncertainties, at this point we're not expecting any time soon to get the base volume back to the pre-pandemic levels, but with that said, it doesn't mean it couldn't happen. We're just not at this point assuming it, and while we haven't given guidance for 2021, we wanted to just give some of our initial thinking. But obviously when we come out with guidance, we're going to give you specifics around what those assumptions are, and at that point we'll have a lot more information. To Steve's point, there is a lot of complexity. We actually do have some geographies that are growing year over year, and then we have some like--and it's really [indiscernible]. If you look at Long Island, you look at Westchester County, you look at New Jersey right outside of Manhattan, they're in much better shape than Manhattan is, and we aren't sure whether that has anything to do with physician office and so on. We think it might be fewer commuters going into the city, they're getting their work done elsewhere instead of while they're at work during the day. But certainly we don't have any specific information on that at this point. Yes Don, as you know, we don't generally prospectively announce the size of a contract, but what we will see as we report our quarterly results and we talk about our growth and where it's coming from, the POS contribution, so certainly moving forward you're going to see the evidence of what Steve just talked about in some of these very large bookings and deals that we're just starting to implement and that will accelerate our growth into 2021. Yes, so I did not intend to imply that PCR volumes will be reduced in Q4. Actually the midpoint of the guidance assumes it stays where it is, where we are right now, and as I shared, through the first couple of weeks of October we're actually slightly ahead of the midpoint of guidance. I wanted to clarify that. In terms of margin, really nothing of significance. We did have in Q3 a significant catch-up expense on our bonus. As I'm sure you could imagine, early in the year we were projecting to significantly miss our targets, and then Q3 really reversed that and got us to a point where we're expected to exceed our targets, so in Q4 we would just have, assuming we deliver, the Q4 proportion of that.  So actually, there was in Q3 a significant incremental expense to catch up our bonuses that will not be repeated in Q4, so there's nothing of huge significance other than there are some of the cost actions that Steve referenced that we have reinstated to normalcy, so we did have some reductions in July on salaries and in Q4, those will be fully to where they were pre-pandemic, and then we did reinstate the 401K match late in Q3 and that will be fully reinstated in Q4. So there are a couple of what I'd call headwinds, but those are really just returning us to pre-pandemic levels, and then normally in Q4 we just have some other margin pressures, given the holidays and some other things that we manage through, but nothing of note. Finally, there is a small amount of incremental investment. I referenced on the things that we're doing around supporting our consumer business. We want to continue to build that business. We think it's going to be increasingly important, and so we do have the opportunity given our business performance to invest, and so there's a little bit of commercial investment into our consumer business that's a step up from where it's been in Q3. I just want to remind everyone, Pito, that the zero out of pocket still has a ways to go, so they started with their fully insured small plans and then expanded it, and then it's going to go out to the sponsored plans. Obviously that's marketed to the employers who are paying those bills, and the good news is we're collaborating with them on that and trying to demonstrate how that will save the employers a whole lot of money. To this point, most of the movement has been through other activity, things that United has done to encourage physicians to stop using out-of-network providers, having us go in and show them the benefits of moving that lab ordering to us and the PLN member, but still a lot of runway in front of us in terms of how that might benefit. The lower burden is really just a new thing. We're putting in some pretty significant requirements around some of the higher cost testing, and they realize that two things - one is that the PLN members can really have more responsible panels or an approach to clinical testing. The second thing is obviously we have good prices as compared to some of the other providers, and we've mentioned in the past that some of the managed Medicaid payors, so outside of United, have used this approach in specifically toxicology to drive better value. You know, with toxicology exploding over the last couple years, they put in some very tight restrictions on utilization, and seeing that the national labs tend to do this responsibly and have better prices, they exempted us from a pre-auth. So not only does it make it easier on physicians and patients, but it tends to steer more work to us because the administrative burden is lower. United sees that in the same areas where they're trying to control some of the growth in high cost testing, but that benefit to us is to come yet. Yes, you know, it's still to be determined. Basically for reference, CPT code 87631, which is the respiratory multiplex panel with three to five targets is $142 today; 87632, with six to 11 targets, is $218, and then 87631 reflux with 12 to 25 targets is $416, so still to be determined exactly where we come out on this. Still have negotiations with the commercial payors, but at least we could reference in the past for some of these multiplex panels, you know, the reimbursement is reasonable. In terms of discussions with the payors, it's still early, Brian. There is not clarity around the exact role that serology is going to play, and while we believe there is going to be an important role, it's not at a point where we're in detailed discussions with the payors yet. Yes, and just to remind everyone, as Steve said, the efficiency is really highly dependent on the positivity rate, and while we do save on reagents, it's not an order of magnitude less expensive. The real economic benefit of pooling comes from capacity increase, so our ability to do more testing and the margins we get on that testing, not a huge difference. There is a benefit but not a huge difference in the cost per individual test that we pool. Yes, so Lisa, it's hard to know specifically what's driving the dampened utilization. Certainly things have opened up a lot more than they were in the spring, so whereas physician offices were closed, I think there was a huge fear in a large part of the population around engaging with the healthcare system at all because of the risk potentially of catching COVID when you went into a physician office. While I wouldn't suggest that's eliminated, certainly that has improved dramatically, so there is some overhang left there certainly but the unemployment rate is probably a contributor right now - we don't know for certain, and we wouldn't expect that to change dramatically certainly in the next six months, or who knows how long before it might turn around. So we're being cautious around our thinking for next year, and we wanted to share that. Obviously people will form their own opinions, but we would expect unemployment to have some dampening on utilization going into next year.  In terms of the COVID volumes, we haven't modeled and we haven't given guidance for '21, but maybe three, six months ago some of us had hoped that COVID might be behind us this calendar year. Clearly, that does not look like it's going to happen, but all this depends on how quickly the vaccines get rolled out, how effective they are, and even once they get rolled out, we see a role, so whether it's a level of testing we're seeing today or something a little less, we expect there to be a meaningful amount of COVID testing, including the PCR testing throughout a reasonable part of next year. Yes, and to Steve's point, for this year based on our guidance expectations, we see our base volume down organically in the high teens, so even if it's down a couple hundred basis points in 2021, it will still be an easy compare for the full year. I can't say they're precisely negatively correlated, but actually that would be my representation. Areas with the lowest positivity rates, like New York, actually are down the most, so we haven't seen a huge parallel movement between spikes in COVID over the last several months and a downturn in utilization. It actually has kind of gone in the opposite direction."

            "name": "Stephen Rusckowski",
            "content": "Thanks Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Quest had a very strong third quarter, benefiting from continued demand from COVID-19 testing as well as the rapid recovery from healthcare utilization. We have performed over 22 million COVID-19 molecular and serology tests to date, more than any other provider. We've also developed and introduced several new innovations that are contributing to enabling the country's ability to return to work, the classroom, and on the athletic field.  I'm extremely proud of all that Quest Diagnostics has accomplished through the COVID-19 pandemic and I want to thank our 47,000 employees for their hard work and dedication.  This morning I'll discuss our performance for the quarter, our role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and update you on our non-COVID base business, and then Mark will provide more detail on the third quarter results and our updated financial outlook for the remainder of the year. Our financial performance in the third quarter was very strong. For the quarter, total revenue grew by more than 42% to $2.79 billion. Earnings per share increased by more than 164% on a reported basis to $4.14 and nearly 145% on an adjusted basis to $4.31. These results reflect continued demand for COVID-19 testing and continued recovery of our base testing volumes as healthcare systems resume non-urgent care and elective surgeries. Organic base testing volumes orders declined high single digits in July and improved in the quarter to mid to high single digit declines in September versus the prior year. Demand for COVID-19 testing came from several areas: clinical testing ordered by healthcare providers as the virus spread throughout much of the country, especially for non COVID-19 pre-surgical patients and people in high risk populations like nursing homes and prisons; in retail testing in our standard network access points, such as our drive-through sites offered across the country by CVS and Wal-Mart; workplace testing as employers sought to return employees to the job and their offices; university testing to facilitate the return of students to campus life, including sports; and our consumer testing direct testing offered by Quest Direct. We've also demonstrated innovation and agility in bringing COVID-19 testing to our nation. In the quarter, we were granted an emergency use authorization, or EUA to offer unobserved self-collection. We were the first provider to receive an EUA due to the pandemic or [indiscernible]. Finally, we teamed up with Wal-Mart and DroneUp to pilot a program for contactless delivery of specialty kits using drones.  Also in the quarter, we announced an initiative along with our Quest Diagnostics Foundation to address and reduce healthcare disparities in underserved communities, including those impacted by COVID-19. This value-based commitment builds on our existing work with [indiscernible] health centers and will focus on serving people of color, elderly and underserved populations in locations throughout the United States. Quest plans to donate testing services and fund a range of initiatives estimated to total more than $100 million. Our goal is to improve access to testing and drive awareness of value of diagnostic innovations and managing health. Before updating you on our base business, what I'd like to do is comment on our recent CMS change to Medicare payment for COVID-19 testing and our decision to return the CARES Act funding to the government. In conjunction with our trade association, we've been currently reviewing the new reimbursement policy for high throughput COVID-19 molecular testing from CMS will impact laboratory and patients we serve. Last week's announcement removes uncertainty that was an overhang on COVID-19 testing reimbursement.  Finally, we're grateful for the CARES Act funding from last spring which provided us at an important time of great uncertainty for our country. Now several months into the pandemic, we no longer require this funding and as a result, we will be returning these funds to the government. That was the right thing to do. We're making progress on our strategy to accelerate growth in the base business, so as a reminder, the five elements of our strategy to accelerate are to grow more than 2% per year through strategically aligned, accretive acquisitions; expand relationships with health plan and hospital health systems; offer the broadest access to diagnostic innovation; be recognized as the consumer friendly provider of diagnostic information services; and then finally, support population health with data analytics and extended care services.  Now I'll share a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Our M&A pipeline remains strong. Since the second quarter, we close our acquisition of Mid America Clinical Laboratories, referred to as MACL, which is Indiana, and we did a couple two small tuck-in acquisitions. Our recent acquisitions have been performing well during the pandemic; for example, our Memorial Hermann outreach acquisition announced earlier this year, as well as this recent MACL acquisition have driven growth in both COVID-19 testing and our base business. We've also seen growth in advanced diagnostics from our acquisition of Blueprint Genetics.  The second growth driver, expanding relationships with health plan and hospital health systems is also delivering. Our hospital reference testing volumes excluding COVID-19 have returned to growth year over year. Given the challenges that hospitals are facing, we expect many more to be open to discussions about how Quest can help them achieve their lab strategy, so in professional lab services this year we have logged a record amount of bookings, represent larger and longer term agreements than in the past.  We also continue to make progress on our health plan strategy. Within the UnitedHealthcare preferred laboratory network, we're helping United reduce out-of-PLN lab spending through the previously announced zero out-of-pocket benefit. In addition, United has added enhancements that reduce the administrative burden for physicians and patients related to those tests requiring preauthorization. Then in August, we entered into a new strategic relationship with Anthem in 12 states. We're working with Anthem to improve quality and efficiency in delivery of laboratory services. Then finally, additionally we're working with major national payors to enable their members to access COVID-19 testing through Quest's relationships with major retailers.  We made progress on our third element of our strategy to accelerate growth by offering the broadest access to innovation. In the quarter, we launched three new combined COVID-19 and respiratory virus tests, reducing time for physician to diagnose and treat patients by identifying nearly 20 viral and bacterial infections from a single swab. We also launched our automated next generation sequencing solution that enables individuals to access genetic testing insights about hereditary diseases at consumer price points through Ancestry Health.  Finally, we grew our direct-to-consumer services in the quarter. Quest Direct test offerings continue to resonate with consumers. In the quarter, we launched our COVID-19 active infection test, offering consumers a choice of using an at-home kit or getting the specimen collection done at a drive-through location. Also, we made remarkable progress in the surge of sign-ups to our My Quest patient portal. Today, roughly 13 million patients have a My Quest account to make appointments or receive their results through their smartphone or their computer. In the third quarter, on average more than 100,000 patients per week signed up for this service. This is more than double the rate we experienced before the pandemic. Now, the second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence by continuing to pursue our goals to reduce our cost base by 3% per year. We also see more opportunities ahead to drive further productivity gains while at the same time enhancing our customer experience and overall service levels.  Here's a couple of examples. We have standardized on the Siemens immunoassay platform in 14 of our 18 regional laboratories. The solution drives workflow efficiencies and has enabled more than a 50% reduction in our equipment footprint. We are still in the early stages of these realized savings but so far, we're pleased with this progress. Then also, our new flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey is being prepared to go live in early 2021. When complete, this state of the art facility will be the most highly automated in our laboratory network and will represent the final regional lab to be converted to our standard operational system, which we call [indiscernible]. This will mark the culmination of a multi-year initiative to simplify, streamline and standardize our regional laboratory operations.  Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark to take you through the results and update you on our outlook. Mark? Thanks Mark. To summarize, we had a very strong third quarter and have performed over 22 million COVID-19 molecular and serology tests to date. We've also developed and introduced a number of new innovations allowing the country to get back to work, into the classroom, and onto the athletic fields. We've seen further signs of recovery in healthcare utilization as our base testing volume continued to recover rapidly throughout the third quarter. Finally, again I'm extremely proud of all that Quest Diagnostics has accomplished throughout this very difficult time, and I thank all the 42,000 people at Quest Diagnostics for all their hard work and dedication. Now we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Let me start with the operational piece of that, Ann. First of all, we're running about a capacity of 200,000 tests per day, even though what you heard from our guidance is less than that in terms of actual results. We've done that for two reasons. One is to be prepared for the fall where we're anticipating further demand for COVID-19 testing, and then secondly is when we have more capacity and we result less, it helps us with turnaround time, so I'm happy to share that right now we're averaging less than two days for testing for COVID-19. What I'll also say, as I said in my early introductory remarks, we're trying to understand the exact guidelines, and I'm sure there will be more detail from CMS In terms of recovery--excuse me, reimbursement changes. When we're looking at turnaround times, we're looking at it today from specimen collection to results, and that's also by calendar day, and there will be more specificity on this from CMS but--you know, there will be more clarity around that.  So we're performing well with, I think, capacity versus our demand, and we're not stopping there. We're actually increasing our capacity as we speak. We're working out some of the last capacity we can get out of some of the new systems we put in place, and secondly we're looking at applying pooling to some of our IBB platforms, so that should get us to eventually coming out of this year at 250,000 per day versus the 200,000 today, so we should be able to meet the demand and keep our turnaround times at the level I've already indicated. Mark? Yes, and we're watching that carefully. If you go back and hear what I said, we started off July at high single digits, and then also as I indicated in September, it was mid to high, so slight improvement there but we're watching it as we enter the fourth quarter and as we sit here in the fourth quarter in October. Yes, so Ricky we managed our workforce carefully over the last six to nine months. As you'll recall, the second quarter we had to trim down our workforce, so we furloughed over 6,000 people, we reduced work schedules, we cut salaries including myself and Mark and our board, and then we saw the steady recovery in our base business coupled with the COVID testing that we've done.  So we've reinstated salaries, we have brought back full work weeks and we've brought back the vast majority of the furloughed employees, and actually we've hired people, so we've hired people where we need to hire people, particularly in areas like specimen processing. You can see with the volumes we're seeing, you have to have a lot of people to receive all these specimens to sort it out before they go into the lab. But I'll tell you, we're still being very, very careful before we add another person. We're being very careful in overhead, and Mark can go through exactly what's in our expenses, but we've been very limited in hiring in our expense categories and will continue to be very [indiscernible] with our hiring for our overhead with our laboratory operations and our operations in general. The reason for that is we want to make sure we don't' get ahead of ourselves. We feel we got good leverage in the third quarter, as you see, and we believe we have a workforce in place to manage the demand we're getting right now. We're constantly looking at what we think the future demand will be, but we want to make sure we don't get ahead of ourselves. We indicated what we think the fourth quarter's going to be. We are building capacity to get more COVID-19 testing done. We have plenty of capacity available for serology without adding a lot of staff, with the exception of some of the volume based jobs as I mentioned, and so as we get deeper into the fourth quarter and we get into the beginning of next year, we'll then assess if we need to add some people. But so far, we've done some modest hiring, we're back to full workforce, and we're watching it, frankly, daily and we want to make sure we don't add people before we need them. And interestingly enough, this is a last point because we do have this natural hedge on this, is despite where we are with the economy, we still have attrition in some of our draws, so we're in some places still trying to keep up. There are other options for people particularly with some of our non-exempt employment jobs, and therefore if things turn down, we could carefully turn off our spigot as well. Yes, so let me start with where we saw some uncertainty and therefore the word we used, overhang. First of all, for this year we had some uncertainty, as you know, in the third quarter about the emergency order that's in place, and that was extended to October. We are hopeful that the rate would continue at $100, and it's our expectation given that the new rate changes with the incentive that we outlined [indiscernible] on January, so therefore we're assuming the $100 for reimbursement for the remainder of this year. But up until we heard this, there was some uncertainty about 2020. Then secondly, in 2021 remember the original rate was at $51 and it went up to $100, and so therefore the new reimbursement that's being spoken of, again if you get the turnaround time of two days, you're at $100, if you don't, it's $75, so that removes some of that uncertainty of it reverting back to where it was before we got the bump from $51 to $100.  Mark, do you want to take it on the commercial side? Some color around--you know, we've got variation around geography and around clinical franchises, so by way of example, New York City has still not recovered and we have a fair business in New York, so if you look at the percentage overall that's affected by New York not recovering. There's other parts of the country that are fully recovered, so we're watching that carefully and we're watching it by city. If things change by city or state, we can understand the consequence of that.  Then secondly, we've got some clinical franchises that are back to pre-pandemic levels but we still have the laggers. We have our prescription drug monitoring business which is still below pre-pandemic levels, so if you look at it from a couple different dimensions, you can understand why we're below pre-pandemic, and then what it takes to get back to where we were going into 2020 and potentially get above it, it will require some of these areas to get back to normal levels that we saw in the winter months, before we hit the pandemic in March. Yes, thanks. I'll take the first part around point-of-care solutions. As you know, there's two point-of-care solutions. One of the point-of-care diagnostic solutions that were out there for some time provided by IBD manufacturers, and for all intents and purposes they were there for a number of months and they provided a role. Then most recently, I believe you are referring to what's happening with the antigen testing. We do believe there will be a role for antigen testing, particularly for monitoring and surveillance of a population. But we do understand for a lot of reasons why PCR and the return to the lab model is going to continue to be the gold standard. One of the reasons for that, depending upon the quality of the antigen testing that might be applied, there are requirements around reflex testing to PCR for both positives and negatives, and also we believe that physicians do prefer PCR testing, and when we're offered, it means flu respiratory panel and COVID tests that will be a PCR, and we think with the flu season coming out that we are going to get some demand for it as well. So we believe that antigen testing will be a necessary part of our portfolio and we do expect to be bringing out a solution for antigen testing as part of our services we offer, but it will be complementary to the PCR testing that we're currently doing. Hopefully that provides some clarity of what we think the role will be. Then finally on the consumer piece, we do believe that there is increased interest in our direct-to-consumer offerings for the basic testing. As you all know, a number of patients have not gone to their doctors as they should. We do believe there is an opportunity for them to have their lipid panel checked for their cholesterol, make sure the statins are working properly - you know, [indiscernible] glucose A1c, sexually transmitted diseases. As we've mentioned, we've brought up serology testing direct to consumer and most recently COVID-19 testing. We believe there is interest in a very convenient approach to getting testing, and we couple this with a telehealth physician consult as part of our service and we do believe going forward, there is going to be increased demand for both telehealth in terms of its role in our business overall, and then secondly is testing and getting that either indirectly through Quest Direct or getting that through a telehealth provider as well. We're very well positioned in that regard with our relationships with telehealth companies but also with Quest Direct. Before the pandemic, we kicked this program off, and so we have a nice platform that's been building up volume and we feel that there's going to be more opportunities in front of us as the demand, given the circumstances, continues to have a lot of interest from consumers. Yes, well we're encouraged. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the hospital business is actually growing again versus last year, and that's encouraging, and that's without COVID-19, so that's an encouraging trend. We see hospitals back in business and we're seeing the testing that you would expect from those hospitals, and we're doing well in that marketplace. This is where what we traditionally called our reference testing business. Then in addition to this, over the years we have built up a professional lab services business. This isn't just a new program - we've been working on this for over five or six years, and we've built up a nice portfolio of referenceable accounts and that's serving us well. We are penning a number of long term, multi-year contracts this year that will provide growth for us in '21 for certain, and we see continued growing interest from integrated delivery systems on how we can help them with their lab strategy. As you know, many of these hospital systems are having a difficult time through the pandemic, and now speaking with many of the CEOs, and I actually had a conversation Tuesday with one, they're looking at a variety of options to get more efficient, get more effective. One of the areas that we've talked about for years, and I think it's going to keep building momentum, is walking in and having a conversation around their lab strategy, which includes the reference testing, the sophisticate testing they send out, how it can help save their money through the acute care laboratory. Then it does beg the question of what they do with their outreach business, and in some cases they sell that to us, and that's what we did with Memorial Hermann this year, with MACL, and we're seeing more and more prospects.  So it continues to receive strong interest, and this year was really a banner year for bookings, and we'll see that in the growth in '21. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that? We continue to work on our relationship with UnitedHealthcare. As we said, in '19 we made some really good progress picking up share related to the PLN. We had a lot of things to do in the fall of 2019 related to employers, zero out of pocket and preauthorization work, and we really felt good about January and February. We actually did see a nice progression of our volumes and then we hit the pandemic in March.  We continue to work those programs and matter of fact, this week I was spending time with United on this and we continue to work on everything we can do to move more of their lab purchases to the PLN, and obviously specifically to us, and there will be other programs that we're working with them by geography, by state to be able to make sure that employers and patients and integrated delivery systems understand the value of what we deliver. Remember if you go back to where we started, we believe that by the improvement in access with United and Verizon and Anthem in Georgia as of the time of our last investor day, it afforded us about a $4 billion opportunity in market, and we believe that we should be able to get about 25% of that. We received some of that in 2019 and we believe there's more opportunity in front of us. So what I can share with you is we continue that work in 2020 and we do expect it will continue to help us pick up some share in '21 to accelerate our growth. Matt, we're watching it carefully. We believe that when somebody presents themselves with symptoms, they want to rule out COVID, and we believe that PCR testing will be the option. As we mentioned, we brought out a new solution which we feel really good about - with a single swab, you can test for influenza, you can also test for other viral and bacterial issues, and that is going to be very convenient for physicians just to quickly diagnose and then treat the patients effectively.  Now what you bring up, we're watching it carefully because with all of us being socially distant and all of us doing a better job of hygiene and schools not being entirely back in session, it might actually lower the infection rate this year, but we're not certain of that, and so we're watching that. Mark, do you want to talk about reimbursement for some of the-- Yes, we're doing our share of serology, running around 10,000 per day. We've got plenty of capacity in front of us. We believe it's going to play an increasingly important role as we get into 2021, as the vaccine becomes available. We're actively engaged with those pharmaceutical companies that are doing the trials for the vaccine and trying to understand where we might play a role [indiscernible] either with the vaccine or post vaccine, and serology has a role there.  We're also doing some serology population health testing. We've done some work for states and we're doing work for the CDC, and we believe that that work will continue to give us a good handle on what is happening with the progression of disease and have an early warning signal if we're moving in the wrong direction, so more to come. We're working through that. We do believe it's going to be a growing and bigger opportunity in 2021 and more visibility of that as we understand where the vaccine is, understand the progression of where we are with the pandemic.  Then also, we will be bringing new solutions out to the marketplace that will provide more and more utility around serology, and more to come on that. But we're working on the science and we believe there's more we can do to contribute towards the pandemic as we go, particularly as we see how the pandemic progresses. Yes, sure. Remember we talked about 200,000 tests per day for capacity, and [indiscernible] resulted in the third quarter about 100,000 per day. Roughly 20% to 25% of that volume is done on what we call our LDTs, and that's where we've been leveraging the pooling capability. It's particularly useful. It has good improvements in productivity and efficiency where you have low prevalence populations because when you do the pooling, when one well lights up, you have to test for that well, and you get a few 14, 15% positivity rates in locations, the mask doesn't mark it out any more, so we're applying it in the right way. It's primarily around our LDT portion of our capacity. What I mentioned in earlier comments was we're looking at applying that to our IBD platform as well, and that will be helpful in moving our capacity from 200 up to 250. Mark, you want to start with '21 comments and the economy? Yes, and just to add to that, remember with the economy, and we saw this back in the Great Recession, whatever happens to the economy will affect access, and so access is important to us [indiscernible]. Second is consumer confidence, and we know a large portion of the population is paying for healthcare out of their own pocket, and therefore they're going to think twice about utilizing it, so we are thinking about that as we think about models in '21. Now with that said, if you look at where we are with our base business versus where it was and you think about the math for the full year, it should be an easy comparison, as Mark said in his comments about '21. Even if it's down versus '19, just to look at the comparison of what the full year will be for '20 versus '21, given where we are right now, that makes for an easy comparison. As far as PCR, remember we brought out our first PCR test on March 9 and we've been ramping rapidly, so we have not had a full year from PCR. We're hitting our stride, we're building capacity because we do anticipate more demand, winter is coming and we're all anticipating more demand as we enter the winter, clearly in the first quarter, and then we'll start to see hopefully some of the vaccines. As we all know, those won't be broadly deployed immediately and the pandemic and the virus will be with us for a large portion of '21, so if you think about the full year of '21 for COVID-19 versus what we did in 2020, there's still going to be a lot of volume for testing and you have the full 12 months versus essentially a half year for PCR in 2020. It's something to think about as you do your models. Well you know, it's by states, really the big four states. California shut down first, we saw a steady rebound, they're still not back to pre-pandemic levels, particularly in some of the large cities like LA. If you go into Texas, we actually saw a good rebound in Texas. We have a great presence in Texas, both in Houston and Dallas, and despite some of the flare-ups we saw in the summer, they still continue to be in the range of where we were pre-pandemic. Look at Florida - it went down in the spring into the summer, there's still issues in Florida. We're still not where they were pre-pandemic. Then if you go to the northeast, New York and Boston and Connecticut, actually we've seen some nice steady recovery with the exception of, as we've indicated earlier, New York City, but specific to the Borough of Manhattan. We still have a ways to go to recover there, so we're watching those, particularly related to infection rates.  But where we have had some of these flare-ups, interesting enough, like in the States of Texas and Florida in the summer months, it did not have a negative of a consequence to our base business as we saw back in the spring, so we're watching it carefully. But so far, we're getting there. Then again, you can't ignore that clinical franchise element of this because some of the portion of the buy-in effects are related to these specific businesses, like prescription drug monitoring, and there's other issues related to what it takes to get those back to pre-pandemic levels that are not related to the geography at all."

Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now, I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.\nShawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I'm on the line with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results, include but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and, or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic's severity and duration, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. healthcare system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope, and effectiveness of federal, state, and local governmental responses to the pandemic, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS from continuing operations, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. References to base testing volumes or base business refer to base testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth, are compounded annual growth rates. Now, here's Steve Rusckowski.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, in one of the most challenging periods of our history, Quest Diagnostics stepped up and expanded COVID-19 testing for the country, and delivered stronger than expected performance in the second quarter. Second quarter results were driven by COVID-19 testing and the rapid recovery of our base testing volume. I'm very proud of Quest employees who have been on the frontlines of healthcare, answering the call, and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. So, this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the quarter, our role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and update you on our non-COVID base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on the second quarter results and our financial position. We have reinstated our financial outlook for the remainder of the year with a broad range, which reflects uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Mark will talk about our outlook in an underlying subject [ph] just in a few minutes. Our financial performance in the second quarter was stronger than anticipated, also lower than the same period of 2019. For the quarter, total revenues declined approximately 6% to $1.83 billion. Earnings per share decreased by approximately 10% on a reported basis, so $1.36; and approximately 18% on an adjusted basis, so $1.42. These results were driven by a strong bounce back in our base testing volumes for March and April, as the healthcare system began to resume non-urgent care and elective surgeries sooner than we had anticipated. Heavy demand for COVID-19 molecular testing helped partially offset the base volume decline as well. Demand came in from a number of areas with the continuing spread of the virus throughout most of the country, the pent-up need to test non-COVID-19 pre-surgical patients, people in high-risk populations like nursing homes and prisons, the proliferation of retail testing sites, and finally, employer interest in testing employees before they return to work. Quest Diagnostics has continued to play a pivotal role in bringing COVID-19 testing capacity to the nation. We performed roughly 8.5 million COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests, and more than 2.5 million antibody or serology tests. We now have the capacity to perform up to 130,000 molecular diagnostic tests today, double the capacity since mid-May. Over the next couple of weeks, we expect to have the capacity to perform approximately 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests per day. Cumulatively, Quest has delivered nearly 20% of all the testing included in this country. Working together with large national retailers like Walmart and CVS, we've built a new model for consumers to access testing. We're also supporting HHS and state drive-through testing initiatives across the country. I'm very proud of the progress we have made in rapidly scaling up capacity since the pandemic began. However, demand for testing has soared in recent weeks. And we are providing testing results in about two days for the highest priority patients, and the average turnaround time for non-priority patients is at least seven days. So, we're doing everything we can to bring more COVID-19 molecular testing to patients and speed the delivery of test results. We continue to add testing platforms and work with our suppliers to ensure access to testing equipment, reagents, and personal protective equipment. We're exploring a range of new technology options, like last week, the FDA granted Quest the nation's first emergency use authorization to use specimen pooling for COVID-19 molecular testing. This technique, which is commonly used with blood banking, will help expand capacity, especially among populations with low estimates. Through our lab referral program, we're partnering with other quality laboratories to expand our available capacity. And in recognition of the magnitude of the current demand for testing, we have asked customers to help us prioritize patients we test for COVID-19 at this time. Quest colleagues have stepped up in so many ways over the last few months to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Our company has been central to the crisis response, and I'm proud of our employees on frontlines who are serving patients, customers, and communities every day. In June, we offered financial assistance to about 23,000 of our frontline colleagues and their supervisors to encourage increased expenses during the pandemic. In April, we took us a series of temporary workforce actions to manage our costs. These included the furloughs, reduced hours, and pay cuts for salaried employees. And then today, I am very pleased to report that a vast majority of these actions were reversed a month earlier to enable us to continue to respond to our customers' increased demand for testing. Since March, we've been fighting COVID-19, but we've also been focused on accelerating growth in the base business. And as a reminder, the five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth are to grow more than 2% per year through accretive [indiscernible] acquisitions, to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems, to offer the broadest access to diagnostics innovation, be recognized as a consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services, and then finally, support population health and data analytics in extended care services. Now, let me take you through a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Through the pandemic, the M&A environment understandably slowed. But despite that, we were able to complete the acquisition of a Memorial Hermann outreach business in April, and are pleased with the early progress. We also recently announced our plan to acquire all of Mid America Clinical Laboratories, or MACL. Once we complete this transaction expected this quarter, Quest will wholly own MACL's laboratory in Indianapolis, and about 50 patient service centers across Indiana. Also, we'll provide professional lab services under a long-term agreement for 30 hospital labs owned and operated by MACL founding hospitals, Ascension St. Vincent and Community Health Network. Our M&A pipeline remains strong. Given the many challenges that hospitals will face, we expect many more to be open to discussions about how Quest can help them achieve their lab strategies. At the same time, we know that all our regional laboratories have had their own challenges. This could also produce more opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. If anything, the pandemic could be an additional catalyst to help drive industry consolidation. Some transactions in the pipeline that were paused because of the pandemic are being revisited, based on the new realities that the healthcare system is experiencing at this time. We also continue to make progress on our health plans strategy. We entered our second year of being a member of your UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network, and we are pleased with the results to date. We have met or exceeded key quality metrics, such as electronic ordering and resulting, and patient service center appointment rates. We've also secured business for more than 180 out of network UHC labs, saving money for patients and lowering the overall cost of care. We look forward to making continued progress with the Preferred Lab Network in the second year. Over the last few months, we've seen a remarkable surge in the sign-ups of our MyQuest patient portal. Today, more than 11 million patients have a MyQuest account to make appointments and receive their results through their smartphone or computer. Since late April, we've seen a more than three-fold increase in weekly registrations, which accelerated at the end of the second quarter. We believe that our patients see and appreciate the ease and convenience of our consumer experience. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the results. Mark?\nMark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.3 billion, down 6.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 5.7% compared to the prior year. Although revenue declined year-over-year, our second quarter results were stronger than we communicated back in June, reflecting the stronger than expected recovery in base testing volumes, as well as growing demand for COVID-19 testing services. Volumes, measured by the number of requisitions, decreased 17.7% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing approximately 50 basis points. Testing volumes in the company's base business declined approximately 34% versus the prior year. In April, base volumes declined in excess of 50% compared to last year, as stay at home measures were implemented across the U.S., hospitals began to limit elective procedures, and many physician offices were temporarily closed for business. Base volume trends began to improve in May, down more than 30%, as stay at home measures [Technical Difficulty], many hospitals reintroduced elective procedures, and some physician offices reopened. The base volume recovery continued in June, down less than 15%, as the trends in May gained momentum. Throughout the quarter, the strongest recoveries were observed in the states that opened more quickly than others, such as Texas and Florida. As we exited June, base volume declines had moderated to approximately high single digits. However, due to the recent spike in COVID-19 cases across the country and the rollback of several state reopening plans, we have seen a slight softening of our base business in early July. While base testing volumes remain down year-over-year, COVID-19 testing was a meaningful offset in the second quarter. We exited the second quarter averaging approximately 110,000 and 26,000 COVID-19 molecular and serology tests respectively each day. Over the next couple of weeks, we expect to have the capacity to perform 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests per day. Revenue per requisition increased 15.3% versus the prior year, primarily driven by reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing. Unit price headwinds were slightly less than 2% in the second quarter, in line with our prior expectations. This includes the ongoing impact PAMA. Reported operating income was $283 million or 15.5% of revenues, compared to $307 million or 15.7% of revenues last year. Reported operating income second quarter includes $65 million of proceeds from the CARES Act. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $294 million or 16.1% of revenues, compared to $352 million or 18% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was due to the significant decline in revenue associated with our base testing volumes, partially offset by COVID-19 testing and our cost reduction actions. Adjusted operating income does not include proceeds from the CARES Act. Reported EPS was $1.36 in the quarter, compared to $1.51 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.42, compared to $1.73 last year. Cash provided by operations was $602 million year-to-date through June 30, versus $596 million in the same period last year. Cash from operations in the second quarter included the $65 million of provider disbursements under the CARES Act I just mentioned. Our financial position remains very strong. During the second quarter, we amended our revolving credit facility, allowing us greater financial flexibility. We completed a $550 million debt offering in May, which may be used to redeem or repay our senior notes due in 2021. Given the better than expected second quarter results, our debt to EBITDA ratio was only slightly above where we ended Q1. We ended the quarter with nearly $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Finally, our Board of Directors remains committed to the company's quarterly dividend at this time. This morning, we reissued our full-year 2020 outlook as follows. Revenue is expected to be between $8 billion and $8.6 billion, an increase of approximately 3.5% to 11.3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $5.66 and $7.66, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $6.60 and $8.60 8 per share. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.25 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $375 million and 400 million. We continue to operate under extremely uncertain conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is evident in the wider than usual outlook ranges we shared in our quarterly press release today. As you consider our new 2020 outlook, I'd like to share the following considerations and assumptions. First, regarding base testing volumes, we expect base testing volumes to remain below prior year levels for the remainder of the year. While the magnitude of the year-over-year decline is likely to fluctuate geographically as states throttle reopening phases, our current outlook does not contemplate the magnitude of base volume declines observed in April and May, and the low end of the outlook assumes an average 20% decline in base testing volumes through the remainder of the year. Regarding molecular COVID-19 testing demand and capacity, we continue to drive towards molecular COVID-19 testing capacity of 150,000 tests per day over the next couple of weeks. Keep in mind this represents peak capacity, operating under optimal conditions. Due to various factors, such as routine maintenance and planned downtime, we generally operate at somewhat under peak capacity. We expect demand for molecular COVID-19 testing to remain high, at least through the third quarter. Please note, that the low end of our outlook assumes recent molecular COVID-19 testing volume trends continue at a similar level throughout the third quarter and then step down in the fourth quarter. Regarding Medicare reimbursement from the molecular COVID-19 testing the existing $100 Medicare reimbursement for molecular COVID-19 testing is tied to the public health emergency declared by HHS. HHS officials have recently indicated they plan to extend the public health emergency for an additional 90 days beyond the current expiration of July 25. Our outlook assumes this level of reimbursement continues through late October. To be clear, we believe HHS to continue the Public Health Emergency while the crisis continues and we are not aware of any plans for it to end. Regarding COVID-19 serology testing, COVID-19 serology testing also continues to help offset declines in base testing volumes. We continue to believe there is meaningful potential within serology testing but rising customer demand remains in front of us. Regarding the cost actions we've undertaken, as Steve mentioned, we have rolled back many of these cost actions we took in April with most remaining actions expected end of July. Finally, as we develop this outlook we contemplated a range of potential outcomes in the second half of 2020. The low end assumes the variability and uncertainty I just described. We have greater degree of visibility in the third quarter and there are far more unknowns in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we currently expect third quarter results to be stronger than the fourth quarter. I will now turn it back to Steve.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. With the sunrise in the second quarter, Quest Diagnostics step up and rapidly expanded COVID-19 testing for the country and delivered stronger than expected performance. Looking forward to the rest of the year, we will continue to expand COVID-19 testing capacity while also serving the unmet needs of healthcare community and drive our strategy to accelerate growth. We reinstated our financial outlook for the full year of 2020 with the broad range, which reflects the continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Finally, I'm very proud of our Quest employees who have been on the frontlines of health care, answering the call and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes: Great, thank you. Again, I want to thank everyone across for what they're doing. I have two questions regarding testing. Could you clarify the comments you made on serology testing, the assumptions in guidance? I think you used the words, it's in front of us. Does that mean you do not have a meaningful contribution for serology testing in 2020 and if so do you think it's more of a 2021 contribution when the vaccine comes out? Then my second question would be around just molecular testing, the pooling that you announced Monday. Should we think about that as just the ability to turn around faster or do you ultimately think it's going to increase the capacity over the 100 to 2000 per day? Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: So it sounds good. Well, on serology we are doing serology as we speak. We brought that up in April. We have in our outlook for the year some serology volume. What I will say is there is growing evidence of the value of serology. There has been some debate of the evidence that would suggest if you have the antibodies that, in fact, it provides the ability for a period of time. It is clear that people are starting to weigh in that, in fact, those antibodies do provide confidence that there will not be a re-infection. As that confidence builds and as we get into the fall and into next year, I do believe there will be a pickup in serology particularly as we start to think about who should get the vaccine and who should not get the vaccine. So I think some of that is in front of us, but we do have some of that in our outlook. As far as molecular testing and pooling in the numbers that I provided particularly getting to 150,000 per day in a couple of weeks, some portion of that will be driven by the opportunities we see with pooling. Some portion of that is also driven by adding new systems and new resources to increase our capacity. What I'll say is we're not stopping there. There's opportunities in front of us beyond that 150,000.\nMark Guinan: I just would like to add in certainly, serology testing is meaningful and we shared in Steve's prepared remarks we've done 2.5 million. That's certainly meaningful. It's just different than molecular where the demand is exceeding our capacity. We had shared earlier that we had capacity of 200,000 serology tests a day with an expectation that demand could possibly be at that level. For various reasons, it's nowhere near that. But certainly, the amount of serology testing we're doing is very meaningful to Quest and is one of the offsets to the base business decline right now.\nAnn Hynes: All right, thanks.\nOperator: Next, we have Stephen Baxter from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nStephen Baxter: Thanks for the question. I also wanted to ask about the molecular testing. Can you talk a little bit about how you referral patterns have looked throughout the quarter and what percentage of that testing volume is now coming from return-to-work? My thought process was that if you are currently utilizing close to full capacity in the molecular side and the return to work opportunity is still largely in front of you, you potentially have pretty high visibility even going out into Q4, one way or another, as there sort of a natural hedge built in there. Then just as my follow-up, it looks like DSOs increased very meaningfully during the quarter. I was hoping you could discuss that a little bit and whether you're seeing any collection challenges or delays with the COVID testing. Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Sure. First, as far as demand, where is it coming from. In our prepared remarks, we took about the different elements of demand and what I'll share with you is that we have demand right now that is exceeding our capacity and we're doing what we can to obviously bring up the capacity. Also, we said in prepared remarks is working with our customers and clients on prioritizing those specimens that we're getting in to make sure we're testing the most urgent need in the country and we're making progress. As we bring up the capacity and we manage our demand over the next several weeks and get into August, we believe as we get through August and into September, we'll have a higher level of capacity, but also a higher level of demand and we'll be able to get to turnaround times that are in the acceptable levels that we've had in the past. So it's in front of us. We're working hard getting there and I think all elements that you described will allow us to be successful through the next several weeks. As far as demand, Steve, you talked about return to work programs. It's starting to come into our demand. We're managing it with employers. We also see in front of us the demand for return to universities and colleges. There'll be a lot of testing required in the month of August around that. We also see physicians bringing up their offices and more physicians are actually sending us persons that they've collected. So we see that adding to the demand. Then there has been broader access and broader availability of testing where people have now at access to asymptomatic testing and very convenient locations. Then I mentioned that our remarks the access we provided with CVS stores and also with Walmart has increased the demand. So, I would say across the board, it's growing in all areas. We do believe though as we get into the September months when we hope there is still a number of employers that are bringing employees back to the office or to work that we are going to be in a place where our capacity will meet the demand that we see in our funnels.\nMark Guinan: Stephen, did you ask about pacing concessions? I didn't quite pick up your last question.\nStephen Baxter: Yes. It just looks to me that the DSOs were up a bit maybe [ph] 5 days -- maybe sequentially something like. I just want to know whether COVID testing or other collection and things with you guys might want to talk about with these things.\nMark Guinan: That's really formulaic approach. Cash collections are stronger as expected. We did have some delayed billing around COVID testing because the payers needed to update their systems and many of them needed 30 days or more to do that so we were holding on some billing, but I can assure you that at this point in terms of our reserves and our cash collections and everything we're very, very comfortable with where we're in our balance sheet. As you can see the operating cash flow was benefited from the CARES Act. $65 million was pretty strong year-over-year despite the depressed volumes revenues and earnings in the second quarter.\nStephen Baxter: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Hey, good morning. So first of all, congrats on the trajectory. Wanted to get your thoughts on one of the top questions I've been getting to the labs, which is how can you convert the short-term opportunity from testing and make your long-term growth rate more durably higher? I was curious to get your take on that. And then, Mark, what does the guidance assume for incremental margins on testing in the second half versus reinvestment and are there any things that you can accelerate to try and improve the longer term trajectory of the business?\nSteve Rusckowski: Let me start with we're going into second half and clearly, our base business is going to continue to be down versus 2019. We are hopeful that we'll start to continue to see some recovery in the back half of the year, but we're not necessarily contemplating any of that in our outlook for 2020. As we get into 2021 it goes back to us continue to work our strategy for accelerated growth and we do believe we have the right strategies and we wanted to share with you in our prepared remarks that we're working those hard. I actually believe that the strategies are actually more appropriate given the pandemic than they were before. So if you think through those, one is, we do believe there could be more acquisitions in front of us for growth through acquisitions. We announced the two deals recently that will prepare us nicely in the back half of the year for growth through acquisitions and sets us up for 2021 too with that carry over on that and the funnel that we're seeing and we're going to push on that front. It will give us some nice growth through acquisitions as we keep on working those in the back half help us in 2021. Second is as far as organic growth in our base business, we continue to work our relationships with the health plans. I would say that our work in the preferred lab network with United is going well. We're going to continue to gain share with them and we're pushing that same type of approach in concept with many peers throughout our route or contracts and we believe there is an opportunity for us to pick up share as we've said in our strategy. We also continue to work with hospitals. We talked about the Mako systems, professional lab services deal. We have a number that are being finalized as we speak that we feel good about and those will give us continued organic growth next year. Then also as we think about our advanced diagnostics and the capabilities we're bringing to the marketplace with gene sequencing and consumer genetic offerings, we believe those strategies will give us some nice opportunities for continued growth next year. So we're continuing to push on the base business growth platform. At the same time, we'll have some natural recovery in our base business as the economy and as healthcare recovers and also through acquisitions. We think we'll be in a good place as we get into 2021 to deliver on that objective that we have of 2% growth through acquisitions. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that?\nMark Guinan: Sure. To answer your EBIT question about margin dropdown, Jack. As we've shared in the past in a short window, we are a highly fixed cost business on our base business, so generally any plus or minus will be 80% or so drop through. It's really supplies and reagents that are the variable costs. The most of it, everything from their logistics infrastructure to phlebotomy to even largely the labour in the laboratory in a window is fixed so variation, good or bad around the base business has a very high drop through. Although we certainly have good margins on our COVID testing there is more variable cost in the COVID testing so it's not quite as high a variable margin on any sort of plus or minus is from our base case, but still very attractive.\nJack Meehan: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning and thank you for all the details. So my question is on the guidance. Mark, you obviously highlighted the assumptions on the low end of the range. Just trying to understand better what you assuming at the high end and especially when we think about molecular testing. I think you're expecting that at the low end that there is going to be a step down in the fourth quarter. So just trying to understand the rationale for that. What type of environment do you see where we're going to see a step down in molecular? What are you assuming at the high end? Then, when we think about just the future of COVID-19 addressable market in relation to vaccine administration as it relates to the molecular are you in any conversations with the vaccine manufacturers and in how do you think -- what do you think the role of testing will be in relation to the vaccine?\nMark Guinan: I'll let you handle the vaccine question, then I'll just talk about the assumptions. Ricky, I appreciate the question. If there is one thing that has been demonstrated over the last several months is we don't have the ability to predict some of these things so I don't think any of us here envisioned a 50% decline in our business in April even when the pandemic first started. Then on the other side, we didn't expect the fast recovery that we saw throughout May and June, given what had happened in April. So we want to recognize that some of these things are out of our control and we want to talk about some ranges of potential outcomes and how they might impact our financial results to take away a little bit and hopefully a large degree of that uncertainty, we've been living with over the last couple of months where people were wondering what might be happening at Quest. But when we talk about PCR molecular volumes falling off in Q4, it's not because we have a vision of that happening, but we had to make some assumptions in the guidance. Since that's several months away and we've shown that even a month or two in the future it's hard to predict that, we didn't expect the surge in June that happened. Therefore we're just being I think appropriately cautious and explaining what those assumptions are, so we don't have any sense that it will follow-up. I think all of us for society are hoping it will follow-up as the infection rate dampens but also note that some of the non-clinical work, the work we're doing for return-to-work for employers and students should be heavy in Q3 and some of that we might expect to step down in Q4. So, that is one driver that might lead you to believe that demand would dampen a little bit in Q4, but it's not as if we know how the virus is going to proceed and the infection rate and certainly some people would say that when we get the flu season, we might even have another spike. So we don't know but we wanted to be very clear around those assumptions.\nSteve Rusckowski: Ricky, on your question about next year and specifically the vaccine. So, first of all, we believe there will be COVID-19 testing next year in 2021. Second is, if we assume we'll have a vaccine next year or sometime, and you go back to what I said earlier about the role of serology and evaluating and prioritizing who should get the vaccine, we do believe there will be a role of testing in 2021 for us. Then finally, in terms of working with those that are developing the vaccine, we are actively in conversations of using our data in a productive way to recruit patients. Some of this is around the vaccine development but also using our data to help with the donation of plasma for the country. So, good use of our data, which is part of our strategy again for growth -- the user data, the smart way as a diagnostic information services provider to help with the pandemic.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Your line is open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Hey, good morning. Sorry to harp on this, but I do want to go back to the guidance. Because when you first updated in early June, you expected breakeven is slightly positive for the quarter, you obviously ended up at $1.42. That essentially implies all of the two key earnings came in June. So if I just run rate that number for six months, I'm already at $8.40 [ph] in earnings before I even contemplate the over $2 you put up in the first half. So -- and again, my guess is COVID testing trajectory moves higher and assuming some continued core recovers, I'm still struggling a little bit to understand the offsets or the headwinds on what appears a pretty extremely conservative range, particularly at the lower end, but just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else.\nMark Guinan: Well, we laid out for you in pretty detailed fashion in the low end. So you can take a look at those assumptions. And,, you can have your own point of view, and that's why we wanted to be very, very clear about that assumption. So your notion that Q2 earnings were all pretty much in June is spot on. And the issue with multiplying that times six for the back half would be a couple things. One is our base business was down exiting the month high single digits of average 15 in June. And the question is, is that sustainable? We'll take a step back, we'll look at worse. We don't know. So certainly, if it were to improve, or were to hold for the whole six months, would say down 10% versus that 20% assumption on our floor, that would make a material difference for the business. And as I just described, at an 80% drop down, you can do some of the math, but our core business was about $2 billion on quarter before COVID. So you know, 1000 basis points is a pretty significant difference on revenue and OM. On the PCR, we shared that we're assuming the volumes dropped down in Q4, not because we have any foreknowledge, but because as I said, return to work and back to school will largely be behind us, and because we don't know. So we want to be cautious about putting on a guidance that counts on the level of PCR testing that at this point is unpredictable. Obviously, we go through Q3 and we get better knowledge towards Q4 and see a need to update that, we would do so. But, given how things have moved around, we want to be really careful. The other thing is, as I said, we fully expect, if we continue to have high levels of COVID and ease-of-testing [ph] that the Federal Emergency will continue, but because that's unpredictable, it could actually be revoked at any time. We want to be very careful about assumptions on reimbursement for our molecular tests. And so, at this point, we're only building in that reimbursement through a 90-day extension, since that's been voiced by HHS. And while we would hope and expect if COVID continues that that reimbursement will continue into Q4, that would make a very significant difference as well. But that is not in either the bottom or the high-end of our current guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Two questions for you, back to the pooling option, that I would have assumed a larger multiplier effect for geographic areas with a low posit testing rates. As you progress into the third quarter, is there a reason why that can't scale to provide a much larger multiplier effect? And what would hold it back from being that large of an impact? And the second question is, as we look into 2021, and if there's a decline in COVID testing, both molecular and serology in the US, is there any discussions about providing testing capabilities for other countries that don't have the testing infrastructure?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, so let me start with pooling. So what you mentioned is true, that is, it's more beneficial in areas that have low prevalence. We've started to ramp up our capacity that will be driven for getting some nice boost in our capacity, which we're planning for, as I mentioned, to get to that 150 [ph] in a couple of weeks. So we're going to apply those concepts in our laboratory developed test locations and try to steer it towards the low prevalence areas to be able to get the best bang for the buck. So we'll push that and the multiplier is considerable when you have low prevalence, so that would be very helpful to bringing up our capacity. We'll keep on pushing on it. As far as testing for non-US geographies, frankly, we are focused entirely for all-intensive purposes on the US. We could consider it in 2021, but it's not in our plans right now and we haven't spent a lot of time thinking about it, as we sit here dealing with the pandemic in the US.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we have Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo: Hi, thanks, and thanks for taking my call. I want to get to the assumption around the vaccine and how to think about this. So if we were to assume a vaccine becomes available January 1, there's a billion doses or whatever the number might be, how do you anticipate the vaccine being distributed and administered along with testing? Are you suggesting that first people would get serology testing to figure out who would need the vaccine or? We can imagine that this vaccine is going to be administered quickly to the entire population. So take me through how you would expect to model out the administration of the vaccine along with testing.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, well, obviously, this is beyond Quest Diagnostics and rationing or prioritizing who should get it first, and what's the progression and how you distribute it throughout the United States. But like with other vaccines, you'd like to get it to the higher-risk groups. And the higher risk groups are those groups that we actually tested initially, higher on the priority list for COVID testing. And so, those were with pre-existing conditions, over the age of 65, and obviously, people that have been compromised with other respiratory illnesses in the past. So independent of serology and antibody testing, my assumption would be those at-risk groups would be high on the priority list. And then, the second priority list would be everyone else. And if, in fact, you were to test positive for the antibodies, then my sense is there will be evidence at that point that will suggest that, in fact, you'll have immunity for a period of time. And the question will be, how much of this would be public policy versus independent choice of whether you want to have the vaccine or not. That's all speculative on my part, a lot to be determined. First of all, where the vaccine will come from, when it's going to be available, how much will the US get. And also, this is going to be I'm sure debated throughout the United States as we get into it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much, and good morning. Steve, I just wanted to follow back up on reimbursement. So, you talked about Medicare. Can you talk about the commercial market? So, it's the anticipation that the commercial market will just follow Medicare through the emergency pricing and what's your anticipation post-emergency pricing, should it be rolled back, number one. And number two, we've heard in the market that some of the health plans are pushing back on multiple tests done on individuals. What's been your experience so far?\nSteve Rusckowski: Sure, sure. So first of all, we do have an assumption that commercial rates are aligned with Medicare rates and, Mark, why don't you just remind everyone what we have in the outlook going forward as far as our assumptions for reimbursement?\nMark Guinan: So we -- the emergency use -- obviously the Federal Emergency expires on July 25th. HHS has expressed a view that they're going to extend that 90 days, so we've built that $100 price which is not our AWR, you know, we don't fully get $100; but that $100 priced into our -- pretty much our full book. And so, the commercial as we shared previously, the commercial payers pretty much fell in line with the Medicare reimbursement rates as a couple of additional state Medicaid plans that didn't quite get there. But for the most part, we get that price from everybody, regardless of who they are. Therefore, we would expect that to continue. So, as long as the Medicare rate stays up, that doesn't mean there wouldn't be some pressure, but we would expect the commercial payers to stay in line with that, because obviously, if it stays, there's a federal emergency, and it'd be hard to argue. They should be cutting the rate for a test that's quite so important. And nonetheless, we will get some pressure. Once we get through that, where the commercial rates end up, obviously, we will take a position that says it shouldn't be less than Medicare. It will be very transparent with what our costs are and the continued importance of that test, even post-emergency and we'll do our best to keep it at the Medicare rate and not something less than that. But that's still -- it's obviously still in front of us.\nSteve Rusckowski: As far as payment policy, reimbursement policy, it is evolving. What I'll share is that frequency policies, first of all, as we all know, you could test negative one week and the next week, it'd be positive. So therefore, it's quite important that people feel that they should get tested if they've been exposed, and if, in fact, they believe that they might have some early symptoms. So, we'll continue to take that as the position and I think by and large people support that notion, but you have seen positions taken on return-to-work programs that employers are moving with, and in many cases, these employees are self-insured. So it's sort of a moot issue, what pocket it comes from. But for those fully insured employers, there is positions by some of the insurers that that's not included in their healthcare reimbursement policies. So therefore, it should be paid for by the employers. And then equally with universities and colleges, whether the students -- free on campus testing is included in the reimbursement like a physical would be, if they're going back to school or playing sports or going -- there's some debate around that. So I would say, characterize it as people are debating some of this. We're seeing kind of a growing trend with some of this. And then, also as we evolve, we're trying to understand who should get tested and who should not get tested. There is even some question of whether, after you've been tested positive and out for 14 days right now, most people are operating on a protocol that you get retested again, but there's some views that maybe that second test to verify your negative is not of great value, and therefore, this might help reduce the demand that we have on the system right now. So that's being debated, as well. So it's evolving, a lot of discussion. And Mark, anything you'd like to add to reimbursement in general on COVID?\nMark Guinan: I would just add that we have not had a significant amount, it would be very few of any denials or frequency limitations. So, while things might evolve, Lisa, to this point, we've not run into issues with the payers around frequency for the molecular tests, and for the return-to-work and back-to-school programs, we are not taking the risk on those. So we are either arranging client bill where we get paid directly contractually by the customer, or in some cases where they think they have coverage from the payer, we have a fall back to where, if we do get a denial, then we have a right to bill the client directly. So, we think we're protecting ourselves for the financial standpoint, we have not run into headwinds less far from the payers on frequency [indiscernible].\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Larew from William Blair. Your line is open.\nMatt Larew: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about how pair mix is trending in the base business, obviously, with the rising unemployment, but also, I suspect that patients in the commercial population may have been quicker to seek services as restrictions were relaxed, and I wanted to follow up on the opportunity for back-to-work and back-to-school. Just curious what discussions you've had and what role lab-based testing might play versus rapid testing? And then, perhaps there is an opportunity for Quest to play a role model not only in testing, but managing the testing strategies for employers, cities or companies, or schools?\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to take the first part of this around payments? I think that was the question.\nMark Guinan: Yes, I'm sorry, Matt, what is your specific question? Can you repeat it?\nMatt Larew: Sure. Just payer mix; how that trended through the quarter in the base business?\nMark Guinan: Yes, payer mix did not change materially. The one thing we did see was an increase in uninsured. So beyond that, I don't think there was any -- and we rarely see -- given our size, we rarely see material changes of payer mix and this was no exception. So certainly, the drop in utilization did not impact people with certain payers more than others. The one that we did see was more uninsured.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, Matt. On return to work programs and university role of let's say point of care devices, we are looking at all those devices and where they can help us, particularly around surveillance. And what we're finding for the initial testing, if you will, the gold standard is the PCR test for like a diagnostic workup and then secondly is for serology or blood based test is the gold standard. The sensitivity and specificity of both those are the best. Still to this day, and there are few devices -- there are a few devices that are coming to the marketplace that are -- that are offering we think an opportunity for us to include that in our services that we provide to both employers and to universities, specifically. Some of the antigen devices are coming to the marketplace we're looking at, you know those devices and some of the sensitivity around 85% which is lower than our sensitivity but for surveillance and in combination with possibly serology and just overall biometric screening of some form, it could be a helpful set of tools for us to manage a population over time. So, we are thinking about how we'll include those in our services to employers and also to universities as they have surveillance for their populations going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Brian\nMark Guinan: Hi, Brian.\nBrian Tanquilut: [Technical Difficulty].\nSteve Rusckowski: Brian, you're breaking up.\nBrian Tanquilut: I'm sorry. Yes, how's this? Better?\nSteve Rusckowski: Much better, much better. Yes.\nBrian Tanquilut: Okay. Yes. So how do you think about the strategy in terms of balancing, increasing capacity beyond that 150,000 tests per day versus the uncertainty of not knowing how big this opportunity really could be? And what are the limiting factors right now that prevent you from pushing that up to say 200 or 250 a day?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. Well, first of all, as I mentioned, on my earlier remarks, we are going to push it beyond 150. And we do see capacity -- excuse me do we do see demand going forward, that's going to be beyond 150. And we do believe we'll get to a point where our capacity will meet that demand. And so we will get there. We'll go beyond the 150. And the limiting factors are, you know, combination of machines. So getting, you know, the IVD test systems and laboratory test equipment, and particularly for laboratory developed tests. It's not just the platforms, the PCR platforms, but in our setup, you know, there's actually two other pieces that you need to consider. It's the extraction and then second is the liquid handling. And it's been some machine constraints on us for getting those systems to be able to bring up -- bring up more and more capacity, but we're working with all our suppliers to get as much as we can get to bring our capacity and take it beyond the 150. The second is just manpower. Yes, we're running 24x7. And as I mentioned in my remarks, you know, doing 8.5 million tests over the last four months, our teams are working nonstop. Remember, this is in our microbiology department that has gone from the backwater of the laboratory to front and center. And we have capacity limits around the people and those that are trained adequately to deliver on this. And then third is just, you know, physically we need to get, you know these systems in place, we need to have the adequate controls and training in place. And that just takes some time. And then fourth is, you know, the reagents. We are rate limited by how much juice we get to run all our different platform. And we're working with our suppliers and getting more. We have had some shortages with some of the suppliers and that has not helped our ability to deliver results. And so we're working actively to, you know, get them to, first of all, give us more and then secondly to be reliable, what they commit to delivering again. So now, I will also say that everyone is working incredibly well together, the IVD manufacturers working with the task force, White House working at future ideas of where we can get more capacity, we're all pushing hard to get more and more capacity. But to answer your question, those are the rate limiting factors around what we need to do to get beyond 150. But we will get it beyond 150. That's where we want to be to be able to meet the demand we see, particularly as we get into the late August, early September time.\nMark Guinan: And Brian, you know, to be clear, you didn't ask this directly, but we are not being conservative. We are doing everything we can. The challenges are not financial, you know, willingness to spend more capital or for that matter, operational expense to get things up and running. They're all operational in our ability to get more equipment and, as Steve said, multiple pieces of equipment, and to get them operating and to get the people who are trained to do it. And we are, you know, moving as quickly as possible. As you said, we doubled our capacity from mid-May, you know, we're expecting another 20,000 per day increase from where we are today over the next several weeks. And then as Steve said, we're going to go beyond that. So there's no, you know, hesitancy to add capacity because of uncertainty and demand. We're doing everything we can to increase our capacity and certainly to reduce turnaround times.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Your line is open.\nEric Coldwell: Hey, thank you very much. Maybe just a couple of quick housekeeping first. I know you said that your guidance assumes PCR volumes declined in 4Q versus 3Q, I'm just curious can you give us a sense on how much what you're expecting for average daily volume in PCR in 4Q that's implicit in your guidance assumption?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, so, you know, Eric, I'm sure you can appreciate that, you know, it's not as if we have a point estimate, forecasts, you know, for every number within that range or even the high-end range, because we've got, you know, multiple factors that can move things material, you know, certainly as we mentioned, the base volume, decline or improvement relative to our assumptions is very material to the outcome. And then that PCR, you know, volume is very, very material, as well. And then finally, the reimbursement rate, you know, beyond the 90-day extension is very, very important. So, you know, there's multi variable so, you know, I really can't answer directly, but, you know, specific number because, you know, we're running scenario planning, but I would tell you that at this point, we have a significant reduction in Q4 demand to get to these guidance numbers. So it's not small, it's fairly significant. And again, not because we know that's what's going to happen, but just given the uncertainty of the volumes and the knowledge that the return to work and back to school volumes will largely be gone by Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we have Derik de Bruin from Bank of America, your line is open.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi, good morning. Two questions. The first one being, can you give a little bit of color on some of the rebounds in the different categories? And then you've noted some softening in July. So can you talk about what you've sort of seen oncology versus clinchem versus pathology, just to give us a flavor on how you're seeing sort of hiccups?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So let me characterize it this way; in primary care, I'll put OB/GYNs [ph] in that as well. We've seen a nice rebound as physicians have opened back up their offices and call back some of their patients. In some cases they have extended hours; so we've seen a nice bounce back on that piece of our demand. Secondly, as we are seeing some nice recovery in some of those -- some of those procedures that might have been pent-up and our pathology tissues have actually rebounded in a good way. We're not sure it's entirely sustainable because there might be some of this is reacted to the pent-up demand that is coming back to us that we lost in April and May and we started to see it in June that will come into the summer. And that's why when we talk about outlook, we are cautious to make sure that we're not taking the June run rate as our run rate forever in the summer. We actually might see some slowdown related to that being absorbed, if you will, through the system. And then we'll get to the run rate that we should expect for a reasonable period of time in Q3. And then, some of our other businesses; we have our life insurance business, frankly, that's down considerably, we haven't seen a big recovery there. Our pre-employment drug testing business is starting to come back as employers start to hire people but is down considerably versus 2019. Our employer population health business where we do wellness programs for employers is down considerably, many of those events have been cancelled. So, I would say it's really a wide variation with the best being primary care and the worst being those that are tied to the economy, and in general, constraints around normal programs like life insurance and wellness and hiring people. So Mark, anything you'd like to add that?\nMark Guinan: Yes. I would just add that most of our base business has come back proportionally. As Steve said, oncology has really picked up recently over the last couple of weeks; we'll see how much of that was deferred pent-up demand. But the one category, it's not just in pre-employment but prescription drug monitoring; so the whole drug testing area, that's lagged a little bit some of the other franchises within the base business, not just in our employer business.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Mike Newshel from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nMike Newshel: Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on pooling. Is there a specific positivity rate threshold you have in mind where pooling makes sense in a particular state and region? And I know you get full reimbursement for each specimen, but how much does pooling change your cost structure? Is there a big incremental margin difference versus testing single specimens?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So, you know, think about, you know, the best is obviously the lowest and where we pool, and we could put four specimens in a well, you know, like quadruples, your throughput per batch, if you will, and if there is zero positives, then you get it all. Where you have positives within that run, you have to test those -- that whole well, and, you know, that obviously starts to eat into the productivity game. So, the best is lower than 2%. We actually have a number of states and geographies that are in that range. Actually, right now the Northeast is doing quite well. We hope that is sustained. And then, as you start to go up to high single digits, it starts to lose it's effectiveness because of all the retesting you need to do. So clearly, less than 5% is in the sweet spot, and greater than 5% starts to get marginally worth it. But we have plenty -- if we look at pooling; again, pooling is applied to our laboratory developed tests, it's a piece of our capacity, it's going to give us more capacity to get us to that 150, and also, we believe beyond. But we're not just doing pooling to get more capacity, we're adding new systems and processes and people everything we talked about earlier. So, it will give us some of the capacity but there's other things we're doing as well.\nMark Guinan: And just a reminder, that pooling is only currently possible on our LDT. And so therefore, you know, it's not as if it's going to be an expander across our whole network, and we can prioritize low prevalence areas or that LDT to a certain extent or to a large extent. And so to Steve's point, we're going to target the areas that we currently have low positivity rates. But the biggest benefit is while we do get costs -- some cost savings on reagents when you can do four samples at once instead of a single one, even despite some retesting; it's really the benefit of the capacity. So, being able to serve more people with the same equipments and more patients is really the benefit, much larger, although there is a certainly a cost of sales savings that comes with pooling.\nOperator: And we have no other questions. Thank you.\nSteve Rusckowski: Okay. Well, we appreciate the time on the phone. We appreciate the extent of your interest in our business. And we hope you, like us, are appreciative of everyone at Quest and what we're doing, and we appreciate your support as well. So have a great day everybody.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics second quarter 2020 conference call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Rusckowski",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Well, in one of the most challenging periods of our history, Quest Diagnostics stepped up and expanded COVID-19 testing for the country, and delivered stronger than expected performance in the second quarter. Second quarter results were driven by COVID-19 testing and the rapid recovery of our base testing volume. I'm very proud of Quest employees who have been on the frontlines of healthcare, answering the call, and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. So, this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the quarter, our role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and update you on our non-COVID base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on the second quarter results and our financial position. We have reinstated our financial outlook for the remainder of the year with a broad range, which reflects uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Mark will talk about our outlook in an underlying subject [ph] just in a few minutes. Our financial performance in the second quarter was stronger than anticipated, also lower than the same period of 2019. For the quarter, total revenues declined approximately 6% to $1.83 billion. Earnings per share decreased by approximately 10% on a reported basis, so $1.36; and approximately 18% on an adjusted basis, so $1.42. These results were driven by a strong bounce back in our base testing volumes for March and April, as the healthcare system began to resume non-urgent care and elective surgeries sooner than we had anticipated. Heavy demand for COVID-19 molecular testing helped partially offset the base volume decline as well. Demand came in from a number of areas with the continuing spread of the virus throughout most of the country, the pent-up need to test non-COVID-19 pre-surgical patients, people in high-risk populations like nursing homes and prisons, the proliferation of retail testing sites, and finally, employer interest in testing employees before they return to work. Quest Diagnostics has continued to play a pivotal role in bringing COVID-19 testing capacity to the nation. We performed roughly 8.5 million COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests, and more than 2.5 million antibody or serology tests. We now have the capacity to perform up to 130,000 molecular diagnostic tests today, double the capacity since mid-May. Over the next couple of weeks, we expect to have the capacity to perform approximately 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests per day. Cumulatively, Quest has delivered nearly 20% of all the testing included in this country. Working together with large national retailers like Walmart and CVS, we've built a new model for consumers to access testing. We're also supporting HHS and state drive-through testing initiatives across the country. I'm very proud of the progress we have made in rapidly scaling up capacity since the pandemic began. However, demand for testing has soared in recent weeks. And we are providing testing results in about two days for the highest priority patients, and the average turnaround time for non-priority patients is at least seven days. So, we're doing everything we can to bring more COVID-19 molecular testing to patients and speed the delivery of test results. We continue to add testing platforms and work with our suppliers to ensure access to testing equipment, reagents, and personal protective equipment. We're exploring a range of new technology options, like last week, the FDA granted Quest the nation's first emergency use authorization to use specimen pooling for COVID-19 molecular testing. This technique, which is commonly used with blood banking, will help expand capacity, especially among populations with low estimates. Through our lab referral program, we're partnering with other quality laboratories to expand our available capacity. And in recognition of the magnitude of the current demand for testing, we have asked customers to help us prioritize patients we test for COVID-19 at this time. Quest colleagues have stepped up in so many ways over the last few months to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Our company has been central to the crisis response, and I'm proud of our employees on frontlines who are serving patients, customers, and communities every day. In June, we offered financial assistance to about 23,000 of our frontline colleagues and their supervisors to encourage increased expenses during the pandemic. In April, we took us a series of temporary workforce actions to manage our costs. These included the furloughs, reduced hours, and pay cuts for salaried employees. And then today, I am very pleased to report that a vast majority of these actions were reversed a month earlier to enable us to continue to respond to our customers' increased demand for testing. Since March, we've been fighting COVID-19, but we've also been focused on accelerating growth in the base business. And as a reminder, the five elements of our strategy to accelerate growth are to grow more than 2% per year through accretive [indiscernible] acquisitions, to expand relationships with health plans and hospital health systems, to offer the broadest access to diagnostics innovation, be recognized as a consumer-friendly provider of diagnostic information services, and then finally, support population health and data analytics in extended care services. Now, let me take you through a few highlights from our strategy to accelerate growth. Through the pandemic, the M&A environment understandably slowed. But despite that, we were able to complete the acquisition of a Memorial Hermann outreach business in April, and are pleased with the early progress. We also recently announced our plan to acquire all of Mid America Clinical Laboratories, or MACL. Once we complete this transaction expected this quarter, Quest will wholly own MACL's laboratory in Indianapolis, and about 50 patient service centers across Indiana. Also, we'll provide professional lab services under a long-term agreement for 30 hospital labs owned and operated by MACL founding hospitals, Ascension St. Vincent and Community Health Network. Our M&A pipeline remains strong. Given the many challenges that hospitals will face, we expect many more to be open to discussions about how Quest can help them achieve their lab strategies. At the same time, we know that all our regional laboratories have had their own challenges. This could also produce more opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. If anything, the pandemic could be an additional catalyst to help drive industry consolidation. Some transactions in the pipeline that were paused because of the pandemic are being revisited, based on the new realities that the healthcare system is experiencing at this time. We also continue to make progress on our health plans strategy. We entered our second year of being a member of your UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network, and we are pleased with the results to date. We have met or exceeded key quality metrics, such as electronic ordering and resulting, and patient service center appointment rates. We've also secured business for more than 180 out of network UHC labs, saving money for patients and lowering the overall cost of care. We look forward to making continued progress with the Preferred Lab Network in the second year. Over the last few months, we've seen a remarkable surge in the sign-ups of our MyQuest patient portal. Today, more than 11 million patients have a MyQuest account to make appointments and receive their results through their smartphone or computer. Since late April, we've seen a more than three-fold increase in weekly registrations, which accelerated at the end of the second quarter. We believe that our patients see and appreciate the ease and convenience of our consumer experience. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the results. Mark? Thanks, Mark. With the sunrise in the second quarter, Quest Diagnostics step up and rapidly expanded COVID-19 testing for the country and delivered stronger than expected performance. Looking forward to the rest of the year, we will continue to expand COVID-19 testing capacity while also serving the unmet needs of healthcare community and drive our strategy to accelerate growth. We reinstated our financial outlook for the full year of 2020 with the broad range, which reflects the continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Finally, I'm very proud of our Quest employees who have been on the frontlines of health care, answering the call and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? So it sounds good. Well, on serology we are doing serology as we speak. We brought that up in April. We have in our outlook for the year some serology volume. What I will say is there is growing evidence of the value of serology. There has been some debate of the evidence that would suggest if you have the antibodies that, in fact, it provides the ability for a period of time. It is clear that people are starting to weigh in that, in fact, those antibodies do provide confidence that there will not be a re-infection. As that confidence builds and as we get into the fall and into next year, I do believe there will be a pickup in serology particularly as we start to think about who should get the vaccine and who should not get the vaccine. So I think some of that is in front of us, but we do have some of that in our outlook. As far as molecular testing and pooling in the numbers that I provided particularly getting to 150,000 per day in a couple of weeks, some portion of that will be driven by the opportunities we see with pooling. Some portion of that is also driven by adding new systems and new resources to increase our capacity. What I'll say is we're not stopping there. There's opportunities in front of us beyond that 150,000. Sure. First, as far as demand, where is it coming from. In our prepared remarks, we took about the different elements of demand and what I'll share with you is that we have demand right now that is exceeding our capacity and we're doing what we can to obviously bring up the capacity. Also, we said in prepared remarks is working with our customers and clients on prioritizing those specimens that we're getting in to make sure we're testing the most urgent need in the country and we're making progress. As we bring up the capacity and we manage our demand over the next several weeks and get into August, we believe as we get through August and into September, we'll have a higher level of capacity, but also a higher level of demand and we'll be able to get to turnaround times that are in the acceptable levels that we've had in the past. So it's in front of us. We're working hard getting there and I think all elements that you described will allow us to be successful through the next several weeks. As far as demand, Steve, you talked about return to work programs. It's starting to come into our demand. We're managing it with employers. We also see in front of us the demand for return to universities and colleges. There'll be a lot of testing required in the month of August around that. We also see physicians bringing up their offices and more physicians are actually sending us persons that they've collected. So we see that adding to the demand. Then there has been broader access and broader availability of testing where people have now at access to asymptomatic testing and very convenient locations. Then I mentioned that our remarks the access we provided with CVS stores and also with Walmart has increased the demand. So, I would say across the board, it's growing in all areas. We do believe though as we get into the September months when we hope there is still a number of employers that are bringing employees back to the office or to work that we are going to be in a place where our capacity will meet the demand that we see in our funnels. Let me start with we're going into second half and clearly, our base business is going to continue to be down versus 2019. We are hopeful that we'll start to continue to see some recovery in the back half of the year, but we're not necessarily contemplating any of that in our outlook for 2020. As we get into 2021 it goes back to us continue to work our strategy for accelerated growth and we do believe we have the right strategies and we wanted to share with you in our prepared remarks that we're working those hard. I actually believe that the strategies are actually more appropriate given the pandemic than they were before. So if you think through those, one is, we do believe there could be more acquisitions in front of us for growth through acquisitions. We announced the two deals recently that will prepare us nicely in the back half of the year for growth through acquisitions and sets us up for 2021 too with that carry over on that and the funnel that we're seeing and we're going to push on that front. It will give us some nice growth through acquisitions as we keep on working those in the back half help us in 2021. Second is as far as organic growth in our base business, we continue to work our relationships with the health plans. I would say that our work in the preferred lab network with United is going well. We're going to continue to gain share with them and we're pushing that same type of approach in concept with many peers throughout our route or contracts and we believe there is an opportunity for us to pick up share as we've said in our strategy. We also continue to work with hospitals. We talked about the Mako systems, professional lab services deal. We have a number that are being finalized as we speak that we feel good about and those will give us continued organic growth next year. Then also as we think about our advanced diagnostics and the capabilities we're bringing to the marketplace with gene sequencing and consumer genetic offerings, we believe those strategies will give us some nice opportunities for continued growth next year. So we're continuing to push on the base business growth platform. At the same time, we'll have some natural recovery in our base business as the economy and as healthcare recovers and also through acquisitions. We think we'll be in a good place as we get into 2021 to deliver on that objective that we have of 2% growth through acquisitions. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that? Ricky, on your question about next year and specifically the vaccine. So, first of all, we believe there will be COVID-19 testing next year in 2021. Second is, if we assume we'll have a vaccine next year or sometime, and you go back to what I said earlier about the role of serology and evaluating and prioritizing who should get the vaccine, we do believe there will be a role of testing in 2021 for us. Then finally, in terms of working with those that are developing the vaccine, we are actively in conversations of using our data in a productive way to recruit patients. Some of this is around the vaccine development but also using our data to help with the donation of plasma for the country. So, good use of our data, which is part of our strategy again for growth -- the user data, the smart way as a diagnostic information services provider to help with the pandemic. Yes, so let me start with pooling. So what you mentioned is true, that is, it's more beneficial in areas that have low prevalence. We've started to ramp up our capacity that will be driven for getting some nice boost in our capacity, which we're planning for, as I mentioned, to get to that 150 [ph] in a couple of weeks. So we're going to apply those concepts in our laboratory developed test locations and try to steer it towards the low prevalence areas to be able to get the best bang for the buck. So we'll push that and the multiplier is considerable when you have low prevalence, so that would be very helpful to bringing up our capacity. We'll keep on pushing on it. As far as testing for non-US geographies, frankly, we are focused entirely for all-intensive purposes on the US. We could consider it in 2021, but it's not in our plans right now and we haven't spent a lot of time thinking about it, as we sit here dealing with the pandemic in the US. Yes, well, obviously, this is beyond Quest Diagnostics and rationing or prioritizing who should get it first, and what's the progression and how you distribute it throughout the United States. But like with other vaccines, you'd like to get it to the higher-risk groups. And the higher risk groups are those groups that we actually tested initially, higher on the priority list for COVID testing. And so, those were with pre-existing conditions, over the age of 65, and obviously, people that have been compromised with other respiratory illnesses in the past. So independent of serology and antibody testing, my assumption would be those at-risk groups would be high on the priority list. And then, the second priority list would be everyone else. And if, in fact, you were to test positive for the antibodies, then my sense is there will be evidence at that point that will suggest that, in fact, you'll have immunity for a period of time. And the question will be, how much of this would be public policy versus independent choice of whether you want to have the vaccine or not. That's all speculative on my part, a lot to be determined. First of all, where the vaccine will come from, when it's going to be available, how much will the US get. And also, this is going to be I'm sure debated throughout the United States as we get into it. Sure, sure. So first of all, we do have an assumption that commercial rates are aligned with Medicare rates and, Mark, why don't you just remind everyone what we have in the outlook going forward as far as our assumptions for reimbursement? As far as payment policy, reimbursement policy, it is evolving. What I'll share is that frequency policies, first of all, as we all know, you could test negative one week and the next week, it'd be positive. So therefore, it's quite important that people feel that they should get tested if they've been exposed, and if, in fact, they believe that they might have some early symptoms. So, we'll continue to take that as the position and I think by and large people support that notion, but you have seen positions taken on return-to-work programs that employers are moving with, and in many cases, these employees are self-insured. So it's sort of a moot issue, what pocket it comes from. But for those fully insured employers, there is positions by some of the insurers that that's not included in their healthcare reimbursement policies. So therefore, it should be paid for by the employers. And then equally with universities and colleges, whether the students -- free on campus testing is included in the reimbursement like a physical would be, if they're going back to school or playing sports or going -- there's some debate around that. So I would say, characterize it as people are debating some of this. We're seeing kind of a growing trend with some of this. And then, also as we evolve, we're trying to understand who should get tested and who should not get tested. There is even some question of whether, after you've been tested positive and out for 14 days right now, most people are operating on a protocol that you get retested again, but there's some views that maybe that second test to verify your negative is not of great value, and therefore, this might help reduce the demand that we have on the system right now. So that's being debated, as well. So it's evolving, a lot of discussion. And Mark, anything you'd like to add to reimbursement in general on COVID? Mark, you want to take the first part of this around payments? I think that was the question. Yes, Matt. On return to work programs and university role of let's say point of care devices, we are looking at all those devices and where they can help us, particularly around surveillance. And what we're finding for the initial testing, if you will, the gold standard is the PCR test for like a diagnostic workup and then secondly is for serology or blood based test is the gold standard. The sensitivity and specificity of both those are the best. Still to this day, and there are few devices -- there are a few devices that are coming to the marketplace that are -- that are offering we think an opportunity for us to include that in our services that we provide to both employers and to universities, specifically. Some of the antigen devices are coming to the marketplace we're looking at, you know those devices and some of the sensitivity around 85% which is lower than our sensitivity but for surveillance and in combination with possibly serology and just overall biometric screening of some form, it could be a helpful set of tools for us to manage a population over time. So, we are thinking about how we'll include those in our services to employers and also to universities as they have surveillance for their populations going forward. Hi, Brian Brian, you're breaking up. Much better, much better. Yes. Yes. Well, first of all, as I mentioned, on my earlier remarks, we are going to push it beyond 150. And we do see capacity -- excuse me do we do see demand going forward, that's going to be beyond 150. And we do believe we'll get to a point where our capacity will meet that demand. And so we will get there. We'll go beyond the 150. And the limiting factors are, you know, combination of machines. So getting, you know, the IVD test systems and laboratory test equipment, and particularly for laboratory developed tests. It's not just the platforms, the PCR platforms, but in our setup, you know, there's actually two other pieces that you need to consider. It's the extraction and then second is the liquid handling. And it's been some machine constraints on us for getting those systems to be able to bring up -- bring up more and more capacity, but we're working with all our suppliers to get as much as we can get to bring our capacity and take it beyond the 150. The second is just manpower. Yes, we're running 24x7. And as I mentioned in my remarks, you know, doing 8.5 million tests over the last four months, our teams are working nonstop. Remember, this is in our microbiology department that has gone from the backwater of the laboratory to front and center. And we have capacity limits around the people and those that are trained adequately to deliver on this. And then third is just, you know, physically we need to get, you know these systems in place, we need to have the adequate controls and training in place. And that just takes some time. And then fourth is, you know, the reagents. We are rate limited by how much juice we get to run all our different platform. And we're working with our suppliers and getting more. We have had some shortages with some of the suppliers and that has not helped our ability to deliver results. And so we're working actively to, you know, get them to, first of all, give us more and then secondly to be reliable, what they commit to delivering again. So now, I will also say that everyone is working incredibly well together, the IVD manufacturers working with the task force, White House working at future ideas of where we can get more capacity, we're all pushing hard to get more and more capacity. But to answer your question, those are the rate limiting factors around what we need to do to get beyond 150. But we will get it beyond 150. That's where we want to be to be able to meet the demand we see, particularly as we get into the late August, early September time. Yes, so, you know, Eric, I'm sure you can appreciate that, you know, it's not as if we have a point estimate, forecasts, you know, for every number within that range or even the high-end range, because we've got, you know, multiple factors that can move things material, you know, certainly as we mentioned, the base volume, decline or improvement relative to our assumptions is very material to the outcome. And then that PCR, you know, volume is very, very material, as well. And then finally, the reimbursement rate, you know, beyond the 90-day extension is very, very important. So, you know, there's multi variable so, you know, I really can't answer directly, but, you know, specific number because, you know, we're running scenario planning, but I would tell you that at this point, we have a significant reduction in Q4 demand to get to these guidance numbers. So it's not small, it's fairly significant. And again, not because we know that's what's going to happen, but just given the uncertainty of the volumes and the knowledge that the return to work and back to school volumes will largely be gone by Q4. Yes. So let me characterize it this way; in primary care, I'll put OB/GYNs [ph] in that as well. We've seen a nice rebound as physicians have opened back up their offices and call back some of their patients. In some cases they have extended hours; so we've seen a nice bounce back on that piece of our demand. Secondly, as we are seeing some nice recovery in some of those -- some of those procedures that might have been pent-up and our pathology tissues have actually rebounded in a good way. We're not sure it's entirely sustainable because there might be some of this is reacted to the pent-up demand that is coming back to us that we lost in April and May and we started to see it in June that will come into the summer. And that's why when we talk about outlook, we are cautious to make sure that we're not taking the June run rate as our run rate forever in the summer. We actually might see some slowdown related to that being absorbed, if you will, through the system. And then we'll get to the run rate that we should expect for a reasonable period of time in Q3. And then, some of our other businesses; we have our life insurance business, frankly, that's down considerably, we haven't seen a big recovery there. Our pre-employment drug testing business is starting to come back as employers start to hire people but is down considerably versus 2019. Our employer population health business where we do wellness programs for employers is down considerably, many of those events have been cancelled. So, I would say it's really a wide variation with the best being primary care and the worst being those that are tied to the economy, and in general, constraints around normal programs like life insurance and wellness and hiring people. So Mark, anything you'd like to add that? Yes. So, you know, think about, you know, the best is obviously the lowest and where we pool, and we could put four specimens in a well, you know, like quadruples, your throughput per batch, if you will, and if there is zero positives, then you get it all. Where you have positives within that run, you have to test those -- that whole well, and, you know, that obviously starts to eat into the productivity game. So, the best is lower than 2%. We actually have a number of states and geographies that are in that range. Actually, right now the Northeast is doing quite well. We hope that is sustained. And then, as you start to go up to high single digits, it starts to lose it's effectiveness because of all the retesting you need to do. So clearly, less than 5% is in the sweet spot, and greater than 5% starts to get marginally worth it. But we have plenty -- if we look at pooling; again, pooling is applied to our laboratory developed tests, it's a piece of our capacity, it's going to give us more capacity to get us to that 150, and also, we believe beyond. But we're not just doing pooling to get more capacity, we're adding new systems and processes and people everything we talked about earlier. So, it will give us some of the capacity but there's other things we're doing as well. Okay. Well, we appreciate the time on the phone. We appreciate the extent of your interest in our business. And we hope you, like us, are appreciative of everyone at Quest and what we're doing, and we appreciate your support as well. So have a great day everybody."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.3 billion, down 6.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 5.7% compared to the prior year. Although revenue declined year-over-year, our second quarter results were stronger than we communicated back in June, reflecting the stronger than expected recovery in base testing volumes, as well as growing demand for COVID-19 testing services. Volumes, measured by the number of requisitions, decreased 17.7% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing approximately 50 basis points. Testing volumes in the company's base business declined approximately 34% versus the prior year. In April, base volumes declined in excess of 50% compared to last year, as stay at home measures were implemented across the U.S., hospitals began to limit elective procedures, and many physician offices were temporarily closed for business. Base volume trends began to improve in May, down more than 30%, as stay at home measures [Technical Difficulty], many hospitals reintroduced elective procedures, and some physician offices reopened. The base volume recovery continued in June, down less than 15%, as the trends in May gained momentum. Throughout the quarter, the strongest recoveries were observed in the states that opened more quickly than others, such as Texas and Florida. As we exited June, base volume declines had moderated to approximately high single digits. However, due to the recent spike in COVID-19 cases across the country and the rollback of several state reopening plans, we have seen a slight softening of our base business in early July. While base testing volumes remain down year-over-year, COVID-19 testing was a meaningful offset in the second quarter. We exited the second quarter averaging approximately 110,000 and 26,000 COVID-19 molecular and serology tests respectively each day. Over the next couple of weeks, we expect to have the capacity to perform 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests per day. Revenue per requisition increased 15.3% versus the prior year, primarily driven by reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing. Unit price headwinds were slightly less than 2% in the second quarter, in line with our prior expectations. This includes the ongoing impact PAMA. Reported operating income was $283 million or 15.5% of revenues, compared to $307 million or 15.7% of revenues last year. Reported operating income second quarter includes $65 million of proceeds from the CARES Act. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $294 million or 16.1% of revenues, compared to $352 million or 18% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was due to the significant decline in revenue associated with our base testing volumes, partially offset by COVID-19 testing and our cost reduction actions. Adjusted operating income does not include proceeds from the CARES Act. Reported EPS was $1.36 in the quarter, compared to $1.51 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.42, compared to $1.73 last year. Cash provided by operations was $602 million year-to-date through June 30, versus $596 million in the same period last year. Cash from operations in the second quarter included the $65 million of provider disbursements under the CARES Act I just mentioned. Our financial position remains very strong. During the second quarter, we amended our revolving credit facility, allowing us greater financial flexibility. We completed a $550 million debt offering in May, which may be used to redeem or repay our senior notes due in 2021. Given the better than expected second quarter results, our debt to EBITDA ratio was only slightly above where we ended Q1. We ended the quarter with nearly $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Finally, our Board of Directors remains committed to the company's quarterly dividend at this time. This morning, we reissued our full-year 2020 outlook as follows. Revenue is expected to be between $8 billion and $8.6 billion, an increase of approximately 3.5% to 11.3% versus the prior year. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $5.66 and $7.66, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $6.60 and $8.60 8 per share. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.25 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be between $375 million and 400 million. We continue to operate under extremely uncertain conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is evident in the wider than usual outlook ranges we shared in our quarterly press release today. As you consider our new 2020 outlook, I'd like to share the following considerations and assumptions. First, regarding base testing volumes, we expect base testing volumes to remain below prior year levels for the remainder of the year. While the magnitude of the year-over-year decline is likely to fluctuate geographically as states throttle reopening phases, our current outlook does not contemplate the magnitude of base volume declines observed in April and May, and the low end of the outlook assumes an average 20% decline in base testing volumes through the remainder of the year. Regarding molecular COVID-19 testing demand and capacity, we continue to drive towards molecular COVID-19 testing capacity of 150,000 tests per day over the next couple of weeks. Keep in mind this represents peak capacity, operating under optimal conditions. Due to various factors, such as routine maintenance and planned downtime, we generally operate at somewhat under peak capacity. We expect demand for molecular COVID-19 testing to remain high, at least through the third quarter. Please note, that the low end of our outlook assumes recent molecular COVID-19 testing volume trends continue at a similar level throughout the third quarter and then step down in the fourth quarter. Regarding Medicare reimbursement from the molecular COVID-19 testing the existing $100 Medicare reimbursement for molecular COVID-19 testing is tied to the public health emergency declared by HHS. HHS officials have recently indicated they plan to extend the public health emergency for an additional 90 days beyond the current expiration of July 25. Our outlook assumes this level of reimbursement continues through late October. To be clear, we believe HHS to continue the Public Health Emergency while the crisis continues and we are not aware of any plans for it to end. Regarding COVID-19 serology testing, COVID-19 serology testing also continues to help offset declines in base testing volumes. We continue to believe there is meaningful potential within serology testing but rising customer demand remains in front of us. Regarding the cost actions we've undertaken, as Steve mentioned, we have rolled back many of these cost actions we took in April with most remaining actions expected end of July. Finally, as we develop this outlook we contemplated a range of potential outcomes in the second half of 2020. The low end assumes the variability and uncertainty I just described. We have greater degree of visibility in the third quarter and there are far more unknowns in the fourth quarter. Therefore, we currently expect third quarter results to be stronger than the fourth quarter. I will now turn it back to Steve. I just would like to add in certainly, serology testing is meaningful and we shared in Steve's prepared remarks we've done 2.5 million. That's certainly meaningful. It's just different than molecular where the demand is exceeding our capacity. We had shared earlier that we had capacity of 200,000 serology tests a day with an expectation that demand could possibly be at that level. For various reasons, it's nowhere near that. But certainly, the amount of serology testing we're doing is very meaningful to Quest and is one of the offsets to the base business decline right now. Stephen, did you ask about pacing concessions? I didn't quite pick up your last question. That's really formulaic approach. Cash collections are stronger as expected. We did have some delayed billing around COVID testing because the payers needed to update their systems and many of them needed 30 days or more to do that so we were holding on some billing, but I can assure you that at this point in terms of our reserves and our cash collections and everything we're very, very comfortable with where we're in our balance sheet. As you can see the operating cash flow was benefited from the CARES Act. $65 million was pretty strong year-over-year despite the depressed volumes revenues and earnings in the second quarter. Sure. To answer your EBIT question about margin dropdown, Jack. As we've shared in the past in a short window, we are a highly fixed cost business on our base business, so generally any plus or minus will be 80% or so drop through. It's really supplies and reagents that are the variable costs. The most of it, everything from their logistics infrastructure to phlebotomy to even largely the labour in the laboratory in a window is fixed so variation, good or bad around the base business has a very high drop through. Although we certainly have good margins on our COVID testing there is more variable cost in the COVID testing so it's not quite as high a variable margin on any sort of plus or minus is from our base case, but still very attractive. I'll let you handle the vaccine question, then I'll just talk about the assumptions. Ricky, I appreciate the question. If there is one thing that has been demonstrated over the last several months is we don't have the ability to predict some of these things so I don't think any of us here envisioned a 50% decline in our business in April even when the pandemic first started. Then on the other side, we didn't expect the fast recovery that we saw throughout May and June, given what had happened in April. So we want to recognize that some of these things are out of our control and we want to talk about some ranges of potential outcomes and how they might impact our financial results to take away a little bit and hopefully a large degree of that uncertainty, we've been living with over the last couple of months where people were wondering what might be happening at Quest. But when we talk about PCR molecular volumes falling off in Q4, it's not because we have a vision of that happening, but we had to make some assumptions in the guidance. Since that's several months away and we've shown that even a month or two in the future it's hard to predict that, we didn't expect the surge in June that happened. Therefore we're just being I think appropriately cautious and explaining what those assumptions are, so we don't have any sense that it will follow-up. I think all of us for society are hoping it will follow-up as the infection rate dampens but also note that some of the non-clinical work, the work we're doing for return-to-work for employers and students should be heavy in Q3 and some of that we might expect to step down in Q4. So, that is one driver that might lead you to believe that demand would dampen a little bit in Q4, but it's not as if we know how the virus is going to proceed and the infection rate and certainly some people would say that when we get the flu season, we might even have another spike. So we don't know but we wanted to be very clear around those assumptions. Well, we laid out for you in pretty detailed fashion in the low end. So you can take a look at those assumptions. And,, you can have your own point of view, and that's why we wanted to be very, very clear about that assumption. So your notion that Q2 earnings were all pretty much in June is spot on. And the issue with multiplying that times six for the back half would be a couple things. One is our base business was down exiting the month high single digits of average 15 in June. And the question is, is that sustainable? We'll take a step back, we'll look at worse. We don't know. So certainly, if it were to improve, or were to hold for the whole six months, would say down 10% versus that 20% assumption on our floor, that would make a material difference for the business. And as I just described, at an 80% drop down, you can do some of the math, but our core business was about $2 billion on quarter before COVID. So you know, 1000 basis points is a pretty significant difference on revenue and OM. On the PCR, we shared that we're assuming the volumes dropped down in Q4, not because we have any foreknowledge, but because as I said, return to work and back to school will largely be behind us, and because we don't know. So we want to be cautious about putting on a guidance that counts on the level of PCR testing that at this point is unpredictable. Obviously, we go through Q3 and we get better knowledge towards Q4 and see a need to update that, we would do so. But, given how things have moved around, we want to be really careful. The other thing is, as I said, we fully expect, if we continue to have high levels of COVID and ease-of-testing [ph] that the Federal Emergency will continue, but because that's unpredictable, it could actually be revoked at any time. We want to be very careful about assumptions on reimbursement for our molecular tests. And so, at this point, we're only building in that reimbursement through a 90-day extension, since that's been voiced by HHS. And while we would hope and expect if COVID continues that that reimbursement will continue into Q4, that would make a very significant difference as well. But that is not in either the bottom or the high-end of our current guidance. So we -- the emergency use -- obviously the Federal Emergency expires on July 25th. HHS has expressed a view that they're going to extend that 90 days, so we've built that $100 price which is not our AWR, you know, we don't fully get $100; but that $100 priced into our -- pretty much our full book. And so, the commercial as we shared previously, the commercial payers pretty much fell in line with the Medicare reimbursement rates as a couple of additional state Medicaid plans that didn't quite get there. But for the most part, we get that price from everybody, regardless of who they are. Therefore, we would expect that to continue. So, as long as the Medicare rate stays up, that doesn't mean there wouldn't be some pressure, but we would expect the commercial payers to stay in line with that, because obviously, if it stays, there's a federal emergency, and it'd be hard to argue. They should be cutting the rate for a test that's quite so important. And nonetheless, we will get some pressure. Once we get through that, where the commercial rates end up, obviously, we will take a position that says it shouldn't be less than Medicare. It will be very transparent with what our costs are and the continued importance of that test, even post-emergency and we'll do our best to keep it at the Medicare rate and not something less than that. But that's still -- it's obviously still in front of us. I would just add that we have not had a significant amount, it would be very few of any denials or frequency limitations. So, while things might evolve, Lisa, to this point, we've not run into issues with the payers around frequency for the molecular tests, and for the return-to-work and back-to-school programs, we are not taking the risk on those. So we are either arranging client bill where we get paid directly contractually by the customer, or in some cases where they think they have coverage from the payer, we have a fall back to where, if we do get a denial, then we have a right to bill the client directly. So, we think we're protecting ourselves for the financial standpoint, we have not run into headwinds less far from the payers on frequency [indiscernible]. Yes, I'm sorry, Matt, what is your specific question? Can you repeat it? Yes, payer mix did not change materially. The one thing we did see was an increase in uninsured. So beyond that, I don't think there was any -- and we rarely see -- given our size, we rarely see material changes of payer mix and this was no exception. So certainly, the drop in utilization did not impact people with certain payers more than others. The one that we did see was more uninsured. Hi, Brian. And Brian, you know, to be clear, you didn't ask this directly, but we are not being conservative. We are doing everything we can. The challenges are not financial, you know, willingness to spend more capital or for that matter, operational expense to get things up and running. They're all operational in our ability to get more equipment and, as Steve said, multiple pieces of equipment, and to get them operating and to get the people who are trained to do it. And we are, you know, moving as quickly as possible. As you said, we doubled our capacity from mid-May, you know, we're expecting another 20,000 per day increase from where we are today over the next several weeks. And then as Steve said, we're going to go beyond that. So there's no, you know, hesitancy to add capacity because of uncertainty and demand. We're doing everything we can to increase our capacity and certainly to reduce turnaround times. Yes. I would just add that most of our base business has come back proportionally. As Steve said, oncology has really picked up recently over the last couple of weeks; we'll see how much of that was deferred pent-up demand. But the one category, it's not just in pre-employment but prescription drug monitoring; so the whole drug testing area, that's lagged a little bit some of the other franchises within the base business, not just in our employer business. And just a reminder, that pooling is only currently possible on our LDT. And so therefore, you know, it's not as if it's going to be an expander across our whole network, and we can prioritize low prevalence areas or that LDT to a certain extent or to a large extent. And so to Steve's point, we're going to target the areas that we currently have low positivity rates. But the biggest benefit is while we do get costs -- some cost savings on reagents when you can do four samples at once instead of a single one, even despite some retesting; it's really the benefit of the capacity. So, being able to serve more people with the same equipments and more patients is really the benefit, much larger, although there is a certainly a cost of sales savings that comes with pooling."

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.I would now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead please.\nShawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I'm on the line with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer.During this call we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense. References to adjusted operating income for all periods excludes amortization expense. Finally, growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We are definitely living in extraordinary times. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we all live, work and engage with one another. While the crisis will likely continue to impact our lives in the weeks and months ahead, one thing we can be highly certain of -- we will get through this.So this morning, I will discuss our performance before the crisis hit, the impact the crisis has had in our role in it, and the actions we are taking to mitigate the impact going forward. And then Mark will provide more detail on the first quarter results and our financial position.Our financial performance in the first quarter was off to a strong start in January and February. Through February year-to-date, total revenues grew more than 4%. Total revenues grew more than 6%. Even after adjusting for the calendar benefit and favorable weather in the first two months of the year, organic volume grew more than 4%.However, in March, social distancing and shelter-in-place measures were instituted to combat the spread of COVID-19 and we began to see substantial declines in our business. In the last two weeks of the quarter, we experienced a reduction of volumes in excess of 40%.We saw the impact across all metropolitan markets, not just in hot spots like New York City. In April, volume declines continue to intensify as we are seeing signs that volume declines are bottoming out at around 50% to 60%. As you know, Quest Diagnostics has played a pivotal role in bringing COVID-19 testing capacity to the nation.Since we launched COVID-19 testing with a molecular laboratory developed tests, performed at our Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory at San Juan Capistrano, California. We have performed and reported results of nearly 1 million test to providers and patients across the United States. This is approximately a quarter of all testing done in the United States.We continue to provide testing for -- from 12 laboratories. Through these laboratories who are now able to perform more than 50,000 COVID-19 tests per day. We've also limited our backlog with a current turnaround time of one to two days and less than one day for priority hospital patients.We\u2019ve maximized our output by effectively managing the global supply chain. This has enabled us to have sufficient supplies to collect specimens for patients, runner test and also protect our employees. This has been a team effort that requires a great deal of collaboration.Since early March, we've been in regular contact with the federal government and state and local governments. And this has happened at all levels. We're working closely together with our payers, IVD manufacturers, retailers and our trade associations to bring as much testing capacity as possible to the American people.We've also joined forces with Walmart to make our drive through testing sites available to anyone who may be exhibiting symptoms of the virus, as well as all health care workers and first responders, whether or not they're exhibiting symptoms. We're currently operating in approximately 10 sites in 5 states and have line of sight to approximately 20 locations by the end of the month. There are no out-of-pocket costs for testing at these sites.We're also supporting state and local government COVID-19 testing efforts across the country. Finally, we are pleased to see CMS decide to increase the reimbursement for high throughput molecular COVID-19 testing to $100 last week. This is a strong recognition of the vital role laboratories are playing to support the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we hope to see other payors follow CMS's lead.As we look to the next phase of managing the virus, we've begun to perform antibody testing, which could be useful in improving our understanding of infection rates in a certain area, as well as providing a likely indication of immunity for an individual.Antibody testing, also known as serology testing is a blood based test. We're moving from a testing pilot in which we initially supported a handful of hospitals and health systems to making the test available to all of our customers nationwide using a variety of test platforms.By mid-May, we anticipate having the capacity to perform over 200,000 antibody tests per day. I'm very proud of how our Quest colleagues have stepped up in so many ways. There are so many heroes at Quest from our scientific and medical staffs who have quickly brought up and validated new tests, through our operations teams, to our procurement teams, to our front line phlebotomists, couriers, pilots and specimen processors. And we've taken extra precautions to protect our employees with mandatory temperature checks at our labs and require use of protective equipment such as gloves, lab coats, masks, face shields, all this very depended on circumstances.Our employees take pride in their work because so many Americans depend on the insights of our testing delivers to make decisions to improve care. These efforts for all of us are inspiring. COVID-19 testing is critical to managing the pandemic. And while the volume of testing is substantial, it is that nearly enough to offset the reductions we're seeing in the rest of our business.During this difficult time, we're managing the business for the realities of today and to assure its long-term health. While we cannot say with precision. What the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have in our business, we do know it will have significant impact in our [technical difficulty]. We are taking actions to mitigate that impact.At the end of March, we withdrew our full-year 2020 outlook because we no longer had confidence in the outlook we provided in January. And we have taken a series of temporary actions to manage our workforce costs and conserve cash, to support the business and to navigate our way through the pandemic.This started with a 25% pay cut for me and reductions for salaried employees ranging from 20% for the most senior executives to 5% depending on level. Each of the members of our company's Board of Directors will forego 25% of their cash compensation. These pay reductions will be in place for 12 weeks.We've also suspended contributions to our 401(k) and deferred compensation plans through the remainder of the year. We've approved furloughs for more than 5,500 employees, or approximately 12% of our workforce whose work has diminished and also have indicated an interest to us. We've reduced hours for non-exempt employees where possible and as necessary. And then finally we\u2019ve reduced overtime, frozen virtually all hiring and promotions; and dismissed temporary and contract workers.We're taking a balanced approach to implement these difficult measures. We also want to maintain flexibility because we know when the crisis ends, our volumes will begin to recover and we'll need our colleagues more than ever. This is a challenging time for all of us and in response to that we've established an employee relief fund for those colleagues who need assistance. Importantly, none of these changes will impact our ability to deliver critical COVID-19 testing.Now, I'd like to cover a few other topics. The passage of the CARES Act, the M&A environment and some early thoughts on how the lab industry may evolve in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act became law in late March, delivering much needed stimulus the country as we battle this crisis. The stimulus package included a number of benefits request and other health care providers.First, the Act provided coverage for critical COVID-19 testing at no out-of-pocket costs for nearly all patients. Second, regarding PAMA, the CARES Act suspended the PAMA price cuts that had been scheduled for 2021. In addition, the new round of data collection has been delayed another year into the first quarter of 2022 and will continue to use data from the first quarter of 2019. This is important as it allows ample time to implement the recommendations of the MedPAC study to identify a better way to collect the data that reflects private market rates as Congress initially intended.Third, the Act appropriates $100 billion to health care providers for expenses or lost revenues that are attributed to COVID-19. Quest received approximately $65 million from the initial tranche of the $30 billion distributed to providers earlier this month. Finally, Medicare sequestration will be suspended from May to December this year. This 8-month sequestration holiday will afford us a small benefit.Now, turning to the M&A environment, we continue to make progress. We're pleased that we completed the Memorial Hermann transaction as well as its integration phase, and this is an important complex relationship with a very prominent healthcare system.There are other transactions in the pipeline that we were very close to announcing before the crisis. While they are on hold, our strong conviction is that these discussions will resume, which will be in the third quarter and will be a very good position at that point to complete those transactions.And then finally, I'd like to share some thoughts on industry dynamics, post crisis. Given the many challenges that hospitals will face, we expect many to be open to discussions about Quest and how we can help them achieve their lab strategy. At the same time, we know that many smaller regional labs have had their own challenges. This could produce opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. If any, the crisis could be an additional catalyst to drive the consolidation we've been forecasting for several years.Before I close, I just want to say once again how proud I\u2019m to be part of the Quest team at this historic time. Our employees have stepped up in every way to serve the nation during this time of need. The challenges have brought all of us at Quest closer together, changing the way we work and collaborate, making us stronger as a team. We have become more agile, customer-focused and unified. We will emerge from this crisis stronger with substantial opportunities in front of us.Now, I would like to turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the results as well as our thoughts on our financial position. Mark?\nMark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.82 billion, down 3.7% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 3.8% compared to the prior year. As Steve noted earlier, our business performance was strong in January and February, but we experienced a substantial decline in volumes in March. Volume measured by the number of requisitions decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes declined 2.7%.Before describing some of the volume trends we saw in March and early April, I do want to spend a moment on the strong performance of our business prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through February, year-to-date total revenue growth was just over 4%, with organic revenue growth of just over 3.5%.Total volume growth was strong at 6.3%. Volume through February included a calendar benefit due in part to leap year, as well as mild winter weather. Adjusting for these benefits and the impact of acquisitions, organic volume growth in the first two months of 2020 was nearly 4.5%, indicating that the strong progress you made in 2019 continued into 2020.As we moved into March, we started to see single-digit volume declines through the first two weeks of the month. Stay-at-home measures were implemented in several states by the third week of March, volume declines accelerated to nearly 40%. And by the last week of the month, volume declines across the business started to approach 50%.So far in April, we have indications that volume declines have stabilized in the 50% to 60% range. These declines include the benefit of COVID-19 molecular testing, which has been running at approximately 30,000 tests per day on average or approximately 6% volume growth through April.Revenue per requisition declined 1.2% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher reimbursement pressure. Unit price headwinds were slightly more than 2% in the first quarter in line with our prior expectations. This includes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of approximately 100 basis points.Reported operating income was $175 million or 9.6% of revenues compared to $248 million or 13.2% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $225 million or 12.3% of revenues compared to $286 million or 15.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was entirely due to declining revenue in March as a result of COVID-19.Note that operating margin was up meaningfully year-over-year through February, primarily driven by the strong volume and revenue growth highlighted previously. Reported EPS was $0.73 in the quarter compared to a $1.20 a year-ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.94 compared to $1.40 last year.Cash provided by operations was $247 million in the first quarter versus $275 million last year. I'd like to take a moment to discuss our financial position and our ability to access additional capital. As of March 31, we had $342 million of cash on hand and $1.3 billion of borrowing capacity was available under existing credit facilities. These facilities consist of $529 million available under our secured receivables credit facility and $750 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of March 31.In April, we borrowed $100 million under our secured receivables credit facility and $100 million under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Our secured receivables facility is subject to certain financial covenants with respect to the receivables that comprise the borrowing base and secure the borrowings under the facility.Our unsecured revolving credit facility is also subject to certain financial covenants to limitations on indebtedness. In particular, the unsecured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 3.5x EBITDA as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of March 31, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants.The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact our ability to comply with these covenants, beginning as early as the end of the second quarter. In this scenario, we would not be able to borrow against these credit facilities and then lenders would have the right to demand payment of any amount outstanding.We have been in advanced discussions with our lead lender regarding an amendment to certain financial covenants of our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe this would provide us with the necessary flexibility to remain in compliance for the remainder of 2020.Based on these discussions and the strong support from our lead lender, we are confident we will be able to enter into this amendment later in the quarter. If, for some reason we are unable to enter into this amendment, we believe that our investment grade credit rating would provide us with access to alternate sources of financing. Finally, as noted in our earnings release this morning, we are also suspending share repurchases through the end of the year under our existing repurchase authorization.To summarize, we believe our financial position and ability to access additional capital is strong and our Board of Directors remain committed to the company's quarterly dividend at this time. As many of you know, we withdrew our 2020 guidance on March 31, given the unprecedented uncertainty caused by COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to provide updated 2020 guidance at a more appropriate time when visibility improves around the impact of COVID-19 and the duration of current stay-at-home measures in place across the United States.While we aren\u2019t providing guidance today, I'd like to share some details for you to consider as you build your models. As many of you know, our business is one of high fixed costs. We have modeled a number of different volume scenarios over the near to medium term and at this point our best estimate is that volumes for the business excluding COVID-19 testing will be down 50% to 60% in the second quarter.Once the COVID-19 crisis mitigates or passes and stay-at-home measures begin to lift, we believe our volume will slowly improve but to a lower level in 2020 than where we started the year. While we have taken several cost reduction steps, which we first shared in an 8-K on April 13, these steps are not sufficient to enable us to generate a profit at this volume assumption. If the conditions affecting lower lab utilization continue throughout the second quarter, it is highly likely we will incur a net loss.Molecular COVID-19 testing does serve as a partial offset to the volume declines we're experiencing across the rest of the business. We expect that demand for molecular COVID-19 testing will remain high throughout the second quarter and likely the foreseeable future. In addition to the uncertainty around health care utilization in lab volume trends, another unknown is the impact of serology testing. We believe there's significant potential in serology testing, but reimbursement and customer demand are still in front of us.I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve?\nSteve Rusckowski: To summarize, we were very pleased with January and February performance, but saw a material decline in last two weeks of March. We are managing the company for the long-term and are taking a series of actions to protect our financial flexibility.Quest has been at the tip of the spear in responding to the crisis, and we will continue to play a critical role in the next phase of containing COVID-19. While there's uncertainty in the near-term, we look forward to the gradual improving conditions we see in front of us. Eventually, the healthcare system will start to return to normal and when that happens, Quest will emerge from the crisis stronger with significant opportunities in front of us.Now, we'd be happy to take any questions you have. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ann.\nAnn Hynes: Good morning. First, I want to commend you and all the Quest employees working through this crisis. It's been nice to see.\nSteve Rusckowski: Appreciate that.\nAnn Hynes: But my questions are focused on antibody testing.\nSteve Rusckowski: Sure.\nAnn Hynes: I know you said by mid-May your capacity will be about 200,000. What do you think your peak daily capacity could be over time? Because I'm assuming this is a serology test, it could be higher. And then secondly, what do you think the ultimate -- like how should we view this opportunity? Should we assume that everyone in the U.S. will at some point go a serology test, whether it's to get tested for the vaccine or go back-to-school or to go back to work? And maybe what is Quest doing to maybe grab some more of the market share? Are you working with governments, employees, school systems, things like that would be great. Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. All right, Ann. All right. So all around antibody testing and serology testing. So as you read our press release yesterday, we launched our broad implementation of serology testing. We actually brought up a week or so ago, our first limited LDT laboratory developed tests on the EUROIMMUN platform. And we did that in two of our facilities and we did that for limited customers, hospitals and at risk individuals. So we had some experience with it.And then second, as we brought up our first platform, which is an app platform, and we announced last night, that will -- platform is in many of our sites and we will bring that up quickly. And then we will have a few other platforms we bring up in the course of April into May. And that will allow us to get to that 200,000 tests per day number by mid-May. We've run seven days a week, 24 hours a day. That's about 1.5 million per week. And so you can think about 6 million per month.Now, to answer your questions, we're not stopping there. We've got more capacity in front of us. We are always dependent though on the capacity coming out of the IVD manufacturers with the reagents that we need. So somewhat of the limiting factor has less to do with us where we have lab capacity, but more related to the reagents and the supply chain from our suppliers. So we're working with them as well. So that's what we're willing to say we'll have in the month of May.Now, how broad would this be? What we announced in a press release and you see the guidance from the FDA, while we do believe are several things, one is after a certain number of days and the best indication is after 14 days of being infected, the person can have an IGG response. That's the last antibody. And therefore, it is obviously a good measurement that you have been infected in the past. It's important to those individuals that have not been tested and made it -- might have been asymptomatic. So it's another good indication of infection rate within the geography or within a population. That's number one.Point number two is based upon other viruses. We believe that there may be immunity for some period of time. This is what we need to study. And that's why we have the conditions on our press release that we need to have more evidence and this is why we need to do more of it. The vast majority of viruses in the past have had immunity for a period of time, but we need to confirm this with evidence. So with that said, I would share with you we have tremendous interest in both continuation of the molecular testing that has to be done going forward. And then second is combining it with serology testing. This is happening at the state level for broad infrastructure needs.You might have seen a new announcement by the state of California. They're going to start to test asymptomatic members -- excuse me, citizens within California. Second is employers. We have actually leveraged our capability with our employer population health business, which we used to call our wellness business, where we have this product called Blueprint for Wellness and we work with employers. And we leverage that now in building on those relationships with employers in their return to work programs. And so that's giving us a nice leverage point. And the return to work programs vary by industry. It matters a great deal if you're a manufacturer and you have plants, or if you're an office environment or if you're a food processor, so we have a number of engagements going on with employers. And those employers are working with their states and are working with their cities and towns and local communities, as they think about what needs to happen and within those geographies, because there is wide variation, that's what's happening with the constraints around return to work and shelter-in-place in schools.And then finally, we are working with the states. Many of the states have mounted now task forces to look at what needs to happen next with test -- testing. As I said, California has made now a broader announcement of what they want to do to expand testing. We see this coming from out from a number of states. We're right in the middle of all those conversations. In fact yesterday, I did a press conference with the governor of Connecticut, Governor of Lamont in Connecticut, where we work proactively with one of our partners, Hartford HealthCare and expanding testing in the state of Connecticut.So as Mark said, there's substantial opportunities in front of us both for the molecular testing, which has to be done to rule in, rule out COVID-19. And then you, coupled with the opportunities we see for serology or antibody testing as well for overall surveillance within a population and returning to work. So a good opportunity in front of us.\nAnn Hynes: All right. Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thank you, Ann.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hey, Ralph.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Hey, good morning. Thanks for all the detail. So you mentioned the minus 50% to minus 60% volume ex COVID, I guess first just want to clarify that the profit loss commentary is inclusive of COVID-19, so sort of it's an all-in number or is it enough to offset that profitability loss? And then how do you think about decremental margin with that type of revenue decline? If you can give us any sense there that would be helpful as well. Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, Mark.\nMark Guinan: Sure, Steve. So, Ralph, the statement around net loss would be a volume inclusive of COVID testing continue to be down around 50% to 60%. Now, what that does not include is serology. So as I said in my prepared remarks, the -- well, we're encouraged by the potential demand and a lot of the things that Steve just explained are either in mid-term or a late stage conversations around stepping up some testing for government entities, for employers, etcetera. We haven't been performing that test. Obviously, we just launched serology, so we wanted to be cautious about forecasting in any way how meaningful serology would be.But based on all the things we've talked about, it could be significant. We also don't know the reimbursement rate yet, but hopefully fairly soon. And I think the trigger for commercial rates will largely be based on where CMS comes out. So we're all waiting on that. So that net loss comment and the 50% to 60% would include the current level of PCR where we said we're averaging about 30,000 tests a day. It's offsetting about 6% of our loss, but it does not contemplate significant upside if it happens from serology testing at some point in this quarter. And then on a margin perspective, obviously, if we losing money, the answer to that, but from a drop through perspective, because we are high fixed costs and we've already counted on as much adjustment to our cost structure as we can optimize through our furloughs, through reduced hours to some of those salary reductions for the next twelve weeks. We're largely fixed cost after that.So therefore any sort of volume changes would likely be at a very high ratio, if things were to get worse. As we said, we believe we've bottomed out because we've seen some stability over the last couple of weeks. There's some encouraging signs in some of the areas that were most impacted because not all geographies are created equal. So, some of those are bouncing back a little bit. But at this point, we wanted to be cautious, we wanted to be conservative, we wanted to tell you what we know today. And therefore the outlook for the quarter is not based on speculation. That is based on what we're seeing and what we know today.\nRalph Giacobbe: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi.\nKevin Caliendo: Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking my call. Good morning. A lot to think about here. But one thing I guess we'd like to focus on a little bit is on the cost side, you Invigorate and the plans that you have had in place for a long, long time. How do we think about cost savings, net growth Invigorate, all of that kind of that we had originally built into the model. I'm guessing part of that \u2026\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, yes.\nKevin Caliendo: \u2026 thrown out here.\nSteve Rusckowski: Sure, sure. So let me start, then Mark will I\u2019m sure, add to it. First of all, Invigorate continues. That's a regular cadence and one of our two strategies that we have is to drive operational excellence and a portion of that is our efficiency program and we continue to look for that 3% of our cost basis for years. So that hasn't changed. So we continue to work on those programs. And in that regard, one of our flagship programs that we talk about is the new Clifton Laboratory that will allow us to consolidate the footprint to allow us to put in some new platforms, the immunoassay platform we talked about in the past, that project continues. But what I'll say, we're in the process of refreshing our plans because some of those plans might change. So, for instance, construction in the state of New Jersey might slip some. So some of those might change.And then secondly, some of the expectations around costs within a given year in terms of magnitude might be lower because some of it is volume dependent. However, in terms of percentage, if we're at lower volume levels, they'll be even higher percentages given some of this is fixed. So we're refreshing our perspective, but the goal of getting at least 3% of our cost basis for a year still stands. But we haven't provided an absolute number beyond the 3% in the past. So, Mark, would you like to add to it?\nMark Guinan: Yes, I think Steve summarized it well. A lot of our Invigorate is around volume related activities, whether it's labor, whether it's our lab throughput, whether it's the draws we're doing in a patient service centers. So any sort of savings, certainly will continue as we implement some of the cost improvement efficiency opportunities, but they will be proportional. So obviously the dollars will be less. We always talked about 3% on a $6 billion plus cost base. Obviously if the cost base goes down, given lower volumes, you can expect lower dollar savings. The other thing I would add is that a lot of our efficiency programs are, design along the normal level of testing. So it is difficult to operate as efficiently when you lose half your volume on a given line, some places even more than that and given assays.So the efficiency around reagents and other things operational, things like labor flexibility and so on. So there is some offset to our Invigorate program and lost efficiencies, while we continue at this low level of volume because we're not going to rescale our business obviously to that extent. We're considering this to be temporary at some point, even though I caution we don't expect to be fully back to the level we were prior to COVID. We at some point we'll be back to much more significant testing. I mean, some of our cancer screening is down, very, very significantly. We all know at some point we have to come back and do that work because cancer doesn't go away. So, Invigorate will continue. It will be proportional. There will be some offsets because of the inherent lower efficiencies at these volume levels.\nKevin Caliendo: If I can ask a quick follow-up on the volumes. When you say things have stabilized, are you seeing now a baseline where these are the chronic tests that basically need to be done and or are you starting to see an increase in sort of other testing that might -- you might be considered incremental that you hadn't seen in March that maybe you're now seeing again in April?\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to take that?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So volume has not turned around. We said it stabilize. So when you asked about whether things in March and now we're seeing them pick up, what I would say is that, we worked across what we call our clinical franchises, and there's absolutely differences depending on the acuteness of the condition and the necessity of the testing. But there's some very acute important areas of adjustments and like cancer screening led testing in children, etcetera, that are down significantly just because physician offices are closed and people are uncomfortable going out, or people being told not to go out except for extreme necessary situations. So while we absolutely see some levels of difference across the testing venue and how much it's down, some more than 50% to 60%, some less than that. I can't tell you that we've seen more discretionary type testing come back dramatically yet.\nKevin Caliendo: Guys, thanks so much for all your help on this.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Good morning, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Yes. Good morning. Hope you guys are doing well.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, we're doing well.\nJack Meehan: If you don't mind, I have a three parter on COVID testing. They're all \u2026\nSteve Rusckowski: Let me write it down, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Okay. The first one is where do you think reimbursement is going to shake out? Do you think commercial payers will follow the higher Medicare price? Second, how much further do you plan to scale up the testing? The stimulus package last night seem to call for further expansion. And then finally, just as you fold this all together with the core volumes down, if you look to the second half of the year, do you think net, net, it could be a positive impact as this testing persists? Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So let me start. So on reimbursements, we were really encouraged by CMS upping the rate to $100. We're current -- currently working -- approaching all the commercial insurance companies on what their rate will be. And we don't have an answer on that, but we're encouraged that CMS went up and that's usually an indication that gives us leverage working with the commercial insurance companies. So more to come on that. Second, as Mark said, we still do not have the CMS rate for a serology testing. That's an important fact for us to establish reimbursement for serology, which would be, as we said, a significant opportunity. As far as scale, I mentioned in my comments, we are driving capacity gains going forward. We're bringing up some new platforms, trying to get some additional units. We're looking for different approaches of how we can get more productivity and more capacity from our existing platforms. And that is on the molecular side, will equally be on the serology side. And we have actually been asked by the White House task force to think creatively of what we can do to expand our capacity beyond what we have done so far. So we're thinking our way through that.As I said, we're right now at 50,000 tests per day, and that's for molecular. We're trying to get plans in place to bring us north of that number. But nothing that we can say at this point, but we're aggressively pursuing it. We are encouraged by what we saw last night come out of the Senate and hopefully the House will deliberate and we'll get the next round of funding. And some portion of that will come to us, because we do need to continue to do the testing in this country. And it so depended on both tests happening, molecular testing, as well as the serology tests going forward. So encouraged with the progress we're making, more in front of us. And yes, we will push hard to get more out.And as I said earlier, when I am asked the question about capacity on serology we have to look at the whole supply chain, the front end and the back end. So, yes, we have the lab capacity. But one of the issues we had on molecular side is not having the supplies, the swabs in the right places. We actually have shipped out in excess of a million swabs and we haven't resulted in excess of a million. So we have some inventory sitting out there. And also on the back end, it's very dependent upon IVD manufacturers providing us with the reagents and the kits o be able to increase our capacity as well. So we're working with them. And I can tell you, we're getting a lot of help from the task force, the White House, help from the states, everyone is rolled up their sleeves and trying to get more capacity out there. So there will be more coming, but what we\u2019ve said so far is what we feel comfortable so far, I would say. Mark, you like to add to that?\nMark Guinan: Yes. Let me add a couple of things. So, Jack, almost without exception and certainly all of the national payers and large regional payers, the commercial reimbursement for the PCR test was based on the rate for Medicare and was not a subset or proportion, which obviously it's in the industry practice, but was with at or above the CMS rate. So therefore, I'm confident that we're going to do well. As you know, CMS has updated this price. We are in advanced discussions and I think it's very probable that most, if not all the company, the commercial payers will recognize the higher rate from CMS and our commercial rates will change. So I'm optimistic there.In terms of the second half of the year, as we said, we're very careful. We -- none of us know how this is going to play out, but you can do the math. So if you know, the capacity for serology is in any way meet the demand and Steve talked about 200,000 a day, you have the PCR currently today at 50,000 tests a day combined, those represent almost half of our normal daily testing volume. And given that we don't know serology yet, but we're hopeful the price will be fairly close to an average requisition price for us.And we know that the PCR testing is above that with the CMS rate revision. One would assume that the value of a requisition will be somewhat similar to what our average is today. So, again, I don't know how much the core volume will recover, how quickly it will happen, etcetera. But if there is some recovery and if there is some high level of demand for the COVID-19 testing, as we're all hearing publicly, then you can do the numbers and you can see that the back half of the year could be very different than the second quarter.\nSteve Rusckowski: And just to remind everyone there is a difference. And hopefully it's clear between the molecular testing, which requires a health care professional in most cases to do the specimen collection. And in many cases, they're protected with full garb of personal protection equipment. So that created a bottleneck of people getting tested. And we've worked on some different approaches to that. As a matter of fact, in the Walmart, the Walmart sites, we have observed self collection where actually we have an approved kit from the FDA where it is a nasal swab, but the person can use that swab themselves, but it has to be observed by health care professional.But in the case of Walmart, what actually happens is the person drives up, they provide the order to a health care worker in those parking lots that aren't nearly as protective as what we need to do before, they confirm all the information. The health care worker provides information that close up their window and they do the self collection themselves and it's observed through the window. So that's proven to be highly efficient. And we're looking at other ways of collecting that trend on the molecular side. So that has been a little bit of a bottleneck too on that and we're improving how we get the specimens.Remember, serology is blood based. And so it leverages all our infrastructure. And so as you know we have 12,000 phlebotomists, we have 2,200 patient service centers, we have 4,000 phlebotomists and physicians' offices. And so when this starts to light up, that provides us a nice opportunity to collect those specimens quickly and potentially tag those orders onto other orders that might be coming in from the health care delivery system as health care starts to turn on. So when you think about serology and you think about the front end being much simpler and much more pervasive and leveraging everything already have, not exceptional like the molecular test has been so far.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ricky.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Good morning. And thank you very much for the update that you've been providing over the last four weeks. Very, very helpful and all the transparency. My question is focused on unemployment. Obviously, it's another variable to think about as we think about this year and next. So first, how are you incorporating into your assumptions that Mark talked about. And then if we think historically you have relatively more exposure to Medicaid. Just wanted to better understand, is there something that's structural or will you -- do you expect that we are going to see higher -- as we're seeing higher unemployment to see a move from commercial to Medicaid? And then maybe if you can give us some sense of what's the relative pricing or relative margin so we can we can start framing what that mix shift could mean for second half of the year in 2021? Thank you.\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark, you want to start with that?\nMark Guinan: Yes. So, Ricky, our Medicaid revenues, as you know, are low single digits. Currently Medicaid is typically lower priced than Medicare, typically priced lower than commercial rates. Now when you talk about unemployment, absolutely, we've thought about that. And one of the reasons amongst many that we're cautious about whether volumes bounce back to where they were earlier in the year was the potential for continued unemployment higher than obviously we've had in the number of years. And so, therefore we are recognizing that potential as we think about the balance of the year. And quite frankly, going forward, the other dynamic is if you look historically and obviously we try to do that, I'm sure others have to try to predict what might happen this time, there are some notable differences. One of them is the Affordable Care Act does provide more of a safety net for those who lose their jobs. So that's a positive.But the other thing is, given the magnitude and the speed at which people have become unemployed, it's really difficult to model and predict what that might do to utilization. We are being very cognizant of collectability, not just from patients, but from hospital systems, from physicians. So we're monitoring very, very closely our receivables and collection rates. And we are anticipating likely headwinds on collectability of our revenue going forward, given everything that's going on. So that's certainly on our radar. But the other dynamic is, given that utilization has -- in the last couple of months dropped significantly, one might assume that a greater portion of our revenues would be coming from patients because people will be more slowly or not getting through their deductible and calendar basis relative to where they may have in the past.So we've looked at all of these things and that obviously it will be a headwind. But there's no model we can point to historically to say this is exactly what it means. I mean, in the last significant recession, our collectability rate actually did not materially decline. Utilization was impacted, but we did not have a higher rate of what used to be bad debt. Now it's mostly patient concessions. But given all the dynamics this time, we think that that's a likely possibility. However, you do have the safety net through the Affordable Care Act of expansion of Medicaid in many states. So how all those pieces put together? I can't fully predict, but trust me we're thinking about all that. And as we see trends and as we understand those impacts, as always, we'll be extremely transparent around what we're seeing.\nRicky Goldwasser: Understood. Thank you. And just one follow-up question on the volume side. Whether you -- do you see any differences in geographies? Obviously, you have the national footprint and when we think about different states we're trying to kind of look at the volume declines to try to start to think about how recovery might look like. So are you seeing any differences between volumes in the northeast versus the south versus the west?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So we've built up a model looking at our business from multiple perspectives. One, Mark, said earlier we have variation by types of clinical franchise business we have, some have declined greater, some have declined less. And we're thinking about why that has happened and when there is turning back on to health care delivery system, how quickly they will come back up. So that's one. Second is we do have differences between what's happened in the hospital environment and also physician environment. And so as hospitals start to change what they are going to allow back in their doors, that will change. That is well. And then third, we do see a difference in what's happening by state and by cities. And so we've tracked all of that. And what we have found, as we said in my introductory comments, all metropolitan areas have dropped. Obviously, some of those areas like New York, New Jersey, and now Lawson is starting to light up, parts of Florida have come in later than the West Coast. So we're tracking all of that and we're doing that because we're also trying to see when things might start to turn back on.So you start to see some of the individual states starting to loosen up their shelter-in-place and started to loosen up employers coming back to work. And so we're watching that carefully, so we can kind of indicate where we need to bring back our capacity. We talked about our costs programs. We've talked about furloughs. I want to make sure it's clear. Our furlough program was a program where we offered it to employees, but they had requested from us and we had to grant it. And so we grant out furlough. It allows them to continue to benefits request, but also allows them to collect unemployment and apply to the CARES Act for a weekly stipend. But it also allows us to bring them back. And so they have an obligation to come back when we need them. So as these states start to turn back on, we will bring back the capacity we need to turn it back on. But we're watching that Ricky carefully to understand what's gone down and when did we start to see some recovery by state and by clinical franchise going forward.\nMark Guinan: Yes, the one other thing I'd add is that while shelter-in-place certainly has a significant impact on utilization and some of the greatest volume decreases were in those geographies, as we mentioned, every major metropolitan area in the country was seeing significant declines. Maybe not to the same extent in late March and then into early April, regardless of whether we had shelter-in-place. We are not as true outside the urban areas, but in the metropolitan areas people were being cautious, including physician offices, etcetera in -- how they were accepting patients and whether they were staying open or not and patients were being cautious about whether going out or not, given all the media attention and so on and so forth. So while there is absolutely a correlation with shelter-in-place rules, it's more than that, that has been depressing utilization.\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you.\nShawn Bevec: Folks, there's a number of people still in the queue. And we're getting towards the bottom of the hour and we'd like to get to most of you, so please limit to one question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Baxter with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Steve.\nStephen Baxter: Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey, thanks for all the information and thanks for everything you guys are doing a standup testing capacity.\nSteve Rusckowski: Appreciate it.\nStephen Baxter: I appreciate all the color on the antibody testing so far. So I'm just wondering, I guess, how you guys are thinking about sizing the demand when you scale up capacity to those levels? Because if you could run 6 million tests a month, you could test more than 20% of the country yourself over the next year. And obviously others will be ramping up their antibody testing capacity as well. So it sounds like you think this is going to go well above the sort of like sampling types of analysis that we've seen in places like Germany and New York City starting to pursue. I was hoping you could help us see the bigger picture here, from where you think this might be going over time. Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, well, to start with, if you look at the numbers that come out of the White House in their press briefings, we said that we've done over a million tests. We're close to 25% of the total country's testing. Obviously, we have better percentages, a higher percentage in certain states grew up broader presence. And some states are really just ramping up their testing in a bigger way. If they look at Florida, where we have a big presence that's just really started to light up in a big way. As far as the opportunity in front of us, we are encouraged by the opportunity we see. We're waiting to see how quickly it does ramp up and just what kind of pickup there will be from physicians on serological testing and how fast that ramp will be. But we're building enough capacity to respond to it. And again, a lot of our capacity will be highly depended upon the equipment we have and the reagents we get. So if there's more, we're hopeful we can build on what we have, but we are very limited by that. So we're going to keep our eye on it, push it as one of the two testing categories that should be done to respond to the virus and see how quickly it ran. So we will keep you updated as we learn more.\nStephen Baxter: Is there something that's going to be an add on to your typical kind of routine panels, or do you anticipate people coming in sort of exclusively for these types of test? That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nSteve Rusckowski: I would say both. And I think there's as I mentioned earlier, we're working with employers because many employers are trying to understand how they bring back to employees. And there's wide variation in employers, but these employee programs will both test your employees for the virus with the molecular tests, and they'll also test them for the antibody tests. And we might do those, particularly the antibody test in different types of venues like corporate sponsored events where we can -- now where we can draw the specimen quickly as we do, corporate events they were for flu shots or Blueprint for Wellness program. So we already have that capability of ramping up these corporate programs. And those will be quite different than the traditional way of doing testing that we have with physicians or hospitals today.\nStephen Baxter: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Derik.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Ivy for Derik today. Thank you for taking the question and thank you for comments so far and all the COVID updates in the past few weeks. It's very helpful. So I wanted to talk about longer term here and looking across COVID. So the two parter. One, does COVID change your thought on future wellness and routing testing demand? And two, does COVID and the PAMA delays change your view on lab consolidation. So with this change there could be more difficult to have those conversations with hospital C levels? Just wanted to get your thought on that here?\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark, you start the first one, I had a hard time hearing the first question. Mark, did you pick it up?\nMark Guinan: Go ahead. If you wouldn\u2019t mind repeating, you talked about future wellness.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right. So that's the COVID-19 changed your thought on future wellness and routine testing demand. So in other words, does the crisis drive more routine and one is testing, given that people with preexisting conditions are at higher risk from that virus or there may be more of a downside from the post COVID disruptions.\nMark Guinan: Yes. So on that one, it's very hard to predict. And just like you're asking, it could go either direction. We don't have any sort of crystal ball better than anybody else. Obviously, in my prepared remarks and then one of my answers, I expressed a concern that we're deferring critical diagnostic testing that's important for our health and well-being. And one would hope that at some point we say, that's really important, we've got to find a way to get it done regardless of what risks might be around COVID and whether that bounces back to where it was before or whether to your point could it potentially be more because COVID is obviously much riskier for those with pre-existing conditions that we're all familiar with and that means we want even more tightly manage that. I certainly can't predict it. I\u2019m not sure, if Steve wants to comment anything differently. So that's unclear. But as we said, as we progressed through this and we all learned together, we will be highly transparent around what we're seeing so that you all can understand as much as possible how that is playing out. Then, Steve, the other one was on PAMA lab consolidation.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. We see an opportunity. So if you think about what's happening within the healthcare provider market, we're an indication that volumes are down. You have all the data on possible missions. You have data on physician visits. You see it reflected in our volumes being down. And so hospitals and as we all know, 50% of physicians now are employed by hospital systems are going to be struggling as they enter this quarter. And we'll be looking at opportunities to become more efficient, reduce their cost, generate some cash. And so we believe there could be an opportunity for us to continue our consolidation strategy in the back half the year, it is more of these systems and some of those dialogues we've had for years maybe become more active now because there's now more likely to think about creative ways that they can work with a company like Quest on their lab strategy.So we think that could be another catalysts for consolidation. And as you know, this is also a fragmented industry. There's other regional, especially laboratories. And it also might have worsened other opportunities for us to consolidate. So we believe this is a good opportunity in the long-term for us to continue our strategy of accelerating our growth and consolidating the marketplace. And in the short-term, it's difficult, but in the mid to long-term, we think it could be yet another opportunity to do what we\u2019ve said we wanted to do.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hey, Matt.\nMatt Larew: Thanks. Hey, how are we doing? Thanks for fitting me and I wanted to ask about this sort of pacing through the recovery second quarter and third quarters here. A number of states have targeted opening up at the beginning of May and then some in the second week of May. A component of that and the administrations kind of guidelines are focused on getting some of the non-emergent care back opened up and physician offices opened up. But Mark, I think you mentioned that you anticipate non-COVID testing down 50% to 60% for the quarter. Could you maybe just give a sense for how in terms you're thinking about what those months might look like as states start to open up in some of that care, which as you\u2019ve alluded to, isn't necessarily entirely not elective starts to return.\nMark Guinan: Yes. So as I said, we are not going to speculate, because it shows too hard to predict. So, yes, there's absolutely some potential for volume bouncing back from where it is now. We're not assuming any material improvement for the quarter, not because we know that won't happen, but because we think that's the appropriate point of view to take in order to make sure people are aware of some of the potential downside. We also haven't built in any significant serology volumes into those assumptions. And we've heard a lot of discussion today around that potential demand and ramping up fairly quickly. We don't know to what extent. So I don't want anyone to assume we have too much precision around this 50% to 60% down for the quarter and a, net operating loss. But that's potential if it does stay where it is and we don't get significant serology testing or significant upwards in our PCR testing. I don't know if you want to add anything, Steve, to that.\nSteve Rusckowski: I think I'll add is what I just said earlier. There is going to be a lot of pent up demand from patients. And Mark said there's been a lot of physician offices that have been canceled, postponed and delayed. And so they will start to come back to the system. When that will be, we will vary by city and by state. And so that's what I said earlier in the comments we're tracking all that. So one could think later in the quarter you start to see some recovery. There'll also be those physicians' offices in those hospital systems want to bring back in those patients as well. So we're actually going to do a survey of our customers to get a perspective of what they're thinking about when they turn back on their offices or open up their offices with extended hours, extended workdays. I think people are now thinking that the summer won't be the same summer. July and August won't be the heavy vacation period. So we're watching all that. But as Mark said, too early and too much too much uncertainty around it for us to give you anything more than we provided. But we're keeping an eye, our eyes on it closely.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Donald Hooker with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Don.\nDonald Hooker: Great. Great. Good morning. So in last quarter, you called out some significant expenses around your advanced diagnostics. And I think a part of that was associated with the very interesting acquisition. I think a Blueprint that was kind of thinking about that being a nice tailwind for 2021. It sounds a little discretionary to me. Is that's something you're going to continue to pursue and as we think going forward.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, absolutely. Our strategy to accelerate growth continues. One of those strategies is to continue to build our advanced diagnostics platform. Again, that's all genetics and molecular. The acquisition that we did complete early this year was a nice platform capability acquisition. We feel good about that company coming into Quest Diagnostics. The integration is going well. There's a lot of opportunities in front of us with a genetic base testing. And our plans for that do not change given the crisis step that we have.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nLisa Gill: Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hey, good morning, Lisa.\nMark Guinan: Good morning.\nLisa Gill: Good morning, everyone. Steve, in your prepared comments you talked about changes to the lab industry. And I'm just curious around your thoughts on telemedicine and the impact going forward. So clearly, at some point we're going to start to see physician offices open again, etcetera. But I think every large hospital system, to your point that own physicians has talked about the fact that we'll see more telemedicine going forward. How do you think about your relationship? Do you have any preferred relationships today with Telehealth providers that you anticipate that you'll see more Telehealth services in the home and then they'll be coming to your patient services center? I'm just curious, as to how you think that trend plays into Quest going forward?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So, we\u2019ve been working with all the Telehealth providers and platforms in this many different models as we know. So we do see that as another channel, if you will, or another type of capability as health care provision. And this crisis has burned some of those models there and established some credibility and some comfort with patients. And so we do believe that will become a larger percentage of our volume. And when you have those engagements, many of you on the call probably have had those engagements, they do order testing. And then it follows the workflow that we have for testing within Quest Diagnostics. And then depending upon the model we\u2019ve used in the platforms, the use is telemedicine going to be your primary care physician or would they be an adjunct to it and therefore, we have the connectivity to connect back to the EMR in the primary care physician. So good opportunity. We have strong relationships with many of the Telehealth platforms, big and small. We actually are always prospecting what new startups and ventures are coming up with new capabilities. There's been a lot of new front end capabilities, triage capabilities that you see to run COVID-19, which has been interesting, some of which we're very well of -- we're aware of and have good relations with. So it is changing and this crisis has brought more visibility to it. So we believe that's a good opportunity for us and we're very well positioned with those companies going forward.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nErin Wright: Great.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hey, Erin.\nErin Wright: Hi. Good morning. Hope everyone is well. In terms of PAMA, do you think that you've also earned some goodwill in light of the COVID response that can help with the lobbying efforts overall and for the recalculation of rates there? Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. What I'll say, Erin, is it can't hurt. This crisis has brought to the forefront the importance of testing. And I never believed when I joined this company over eight years ago, that would be on the front page of every news story in America and all over the media, but we are. So it's much easier now for us to make our case with members of Congress, to the administration in HSS with the value of testing and the need for us to get fairly reimbursed. And also to reinforce the intent of Congress in making sure we get a new process put in place that properly reflects the market rates. So it is actually a very good fact for us. We're going to leverage that. Just to remind everyone the CARES Act did change the timing. I had those in my prepared remarks. And then second is we still have the lawsuit going on, which is still happening. And we're hopeful we'll get a decision sometime this year on that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hey, Eric.\nEric Coldwell: Thanks -- hey, thank you very much. You mentioned in prepared remarks the $65 million distribution from the first $30 billion out of the CARES Act. Just a couple of questions on that. Does that mean you're anticipating getting another $150 million plus here in the short-term? $65 million at 30%, so assume it's $150 million less. And secondarily, with the 25 billion of testing stimulus that just came out, are there any impacts to Quest other than just the support of more volume and more activity in the market? Are there any direct impacts from that new 25 billion for testing that just came through in stimulus?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. Mark, do you want to start on the $65 million?\nMark Guinan: Yes. So that was a unique situation. They created a pot of money of $30 billion emergency relief. There were no stipulations for how you would get that money. In fact, we are surprised, it showed up in our bank account. It was based on proportional billings to Medicare and that probably divided up at $30 billion. So anyone who had billed Medicare in the prior year got a portion of that. The other parts of this bill are, for various aspects of getting testing up and running. I will turn to Steve to cover some of that, but there's nothing else that quite mirrors that emergency relief fund where we got the $65 billion. So while there's opportunities for us to utilize some of the other funds, it's not as straightforward and it's not as simple as what happened with that emergency relief fund. So, Steve.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. And I'll just say the package that was just approved by the Senate last night, we don't have a lot of clarity of any specificity underneath the hood, if you will. And then also, as you know, it's going to be debated in the House. So we'll be watching and giving them input as they refine it. But it is critical to get America turn back on, that we have the resources and we're properly reimbursed and paid for the work we do. And as I said, we are the leader for a portion -- a large portion of the country is testing. And therefore, I would expect that some portion of that money we could tap into as a resource for us, but it's uncertain at this time what it will be and if any.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Brian.\nMark Guinan: Good morning, Brian.\nBrian Tanquilut: Good morning, guys, and thanks again for everything. So just for the last question, just really quickly. So, Steve, thanks for all the updates or comments on your -- the hospitals and physicians. But as we think about your referral sources and try to pinpoint the recovery, if you don't mind could you give me some more granularity on where the bulk of your referrals are coming from? Is it primary care specialist and then hospitals? And then I guess my follow-up is just what your average serology test reimbursement is across the platform? Thank you.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So just to give you a scale again of what our different businesses. Of our business, roughly a billion of it before crisis was coming from hospitals. To give you an idea of the scale and -- and then a billion of our business is -- are related services like our population health business with employers, our employer drug testing business, our insurance business. And so the remainder is really physician driven, okay? So, roughly $6 billion of our $8 billion before crisis was -- is physician driven. So those referrals are obviously very important because that's where we get the vast majority of our volume.\nMark Guinan: And then on serology testing, Brian, well, we've never shared a dollar amount. You can look at some of the CMS rates. We've made it clear through our trade association that we don't think the crosswalk that they probably would default to is sufficient. Obviously you saw -- in the first case for the PCR, we weren't successful initially. They established a rate and then they reconsidered, looked at it and almost doubled it. So we're hopeful that in the case of serology, there's some pretty compelling evidence and detail that we're going to get a serology rate for the COVID testing that's more commensurate with the cost that its -- we're going to incur in order to perform it.\nShawn Bevec: Steve, closing remarks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Sure. Well, thanks everyone, for joining us today. Glad we got everyone's questions and we appreciate your continued support and you have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics first quarter 2020 conference call.

            "name": "Steve Rusckowski",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We are definitely living in extraordinary times. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we all live, work and engage with one another. While the crisis will likely continue to impact our lives in the weeks and months ahead, one thing we can be highly certain of -- we will get through this.So this morning, I will discuss our performance before the crisis hit, the impact the crisis has had in our role in it, and the actions we are taking to mitigate the impact going forward. And then Mark will provide more detail on the first quarter results and our financial position.Our financial performance in the first quarter was off to a strong start in January and February. Through February year-to-date, total revenues grew more than 4%. Total revenues grew more than 6%. Even after adjusting for the calendar benefit and favorable weather in the first two months of the year, organic volume grew more than 4%.However, in March, social distancing and shelter-in-place measures were instituted to combat the spread of COVID-19 and we began to see substantial declines in our business. In the last two weeks of the quarter, we experienced a reduction of volumes in excess of 40%.We saw the impact across all metropolitan markets, not just in hot spots like New York City. In April, volume declines continue to intensify as we are seeing signs that volume declines are bottoming out at around 50% to 60%. As you know, Quest Diagnostics has played a pivotal role in bringing COVID-19 testing capacity to the nation.Since we launched COVID-19 testing with a molecular laboratory developed tests, performed at our Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory at San Juan Capistrano, California. We have performed and reported results of nearly 1 million test to providers and patients across the United States. This is approximately a quarter of all testing done in the United States.We continue to provide testing for -- from 12 laboratories. Through these laboratories who are now able to perform more than 50,000 COVID-19 tests per day. We've also limited our backlog with a current turnaround time of one to two days and less than one day for priority hospital patients.We've maximized our output by effectively managing the global supply chain. This has enabled us to have sufficient supplies to collect specimens for patients, runner test and also protect our employees. This has been a team effort that requires a great deal of collaboration.Since early March, we've been in regular contact with the federal government and state and local governments. And this has happened at all levels. We're working closely together with our payers, IVD manufacturers, retailers and our trade associations to bring as much testing capacity as possible to the American people.We've also joined forces with Walmart to make our drive through testing sites available to anyone who may be exhibiting symptoms of the virus, as well as all health care workers and first responders, whether or not they're exhibiting symptoms. We're currently operating in approximately 10 sites in 5 states and have line of sight to approximately 20 locations by the end of the month. There are no out-of-pocket costs for testing at these sites.We're also supporting state and local government COVID-19 testing efforts across the country. Finally, we are pleased to see CMS decide to increase the reimbursement for high throughput molecular COVID-19 testing to $100 last week. This is a strong recognition of the vital role laboratories are playing to support the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and we hope to see other payors follow CMS's lead.As we look to the next phase of managing the virus, we've begun to perform antibody testing, which could be useful in improving our understanding of infection rates in a certain area, as well as providing a likely indication of immunity for an individual.Antibody testing, also known as serology testing is a blood based test. We're moving from a testing pilot in which we initially supported a handful of hospitals and health systems to making the test available to all of our customers nationwide using a variety of test platforms.By mid-May, we anticipate having the capacity to perform over 200,000 antibody tests per day. I'm very proud of how our Quest colleagues have stepped up in so many ways. There are so many heroes at Quest from our scientific and medical staffs who have quickly brought up and validated new tests, through our operations teams, to our procurement teams, to our front line phlebotomists, couriers, pilots and specimen processors. And we've taken extra precautions to protect our employees with mandatory temperature checks at our labs and require use of protective equipment such as gloves, lab coats, masks, face shields, all this very depended on circumstances.Our employees take pride in their work because so many Americans depend on the insights of our testing delivers to make decisions to improve care. These efforts for all of us are inspiring. COVID-19 testing is critical to managing the pandemic. And while the volume of testing is substantial, it is that nearly enough to offset the reductions we're seeing in the rest of our business.During this difficult time, we're managing the business for the realities of today and to assure its long-term health. While we cannot say with precision. What the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have in our business, we do know it will have significant impact in our [technical difficulty]. We are taking actions to mitigate that impact.At the end of March, we withdrew our full-year 2020 outlook because we no longer had confidence in the outlook we provided in January. And we have taken a series of temporary actions to manage our workforce costs and conserve cash, to support the business and to navigate our way through the pandemic.This started with a 25% pay cut for me and reductions for salaried employees ranging from 20% for the most senior executives to 5% depending on level. Each of the members of our company's Board of Directors will forego 25% of their cash compensation. These pay reductions will be in place for 12 weeks.We've also suspended contributions to our 401(k) and deferred compensation plans through the remainder of the year. We've approved furloughs for more than 5,500 employees, or approximately 12% of our workforce whose work has diminished and also have indicated an interest to us. We've reduced hours for non-exempt employees where possible and as necessary. And then finally we've reduced overtime, frozen virtually all hiring and promotions; and dismissed temporary and contract workers.We're taking a balanced approach to implement these difficult measures. We also want to maintain flexibility because we know when the crisis ends, our volumes will begin to recover and we'll need our colleagues more than ever. This is a challenging time for all of us and in response to that we've established an employee relief fund for those colleagues who need assistance. Importantly, none of these changes will impact our ability to deliver critical COVID-19 testing.Now, I'd like to cover a few other topics. The passage of the CARES Act, the M&A environment and some early thoughts on how the lab industry may evolve in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act became law in late March, delivering much needed stimulus the country as we battle this crisis. The stimulus package included a number of benefits request and other health care providers.First, the Act provided coverage for critical COVID-19 testing at no out-of-pocket costs for nearly all patients. Second, regarding PAMA, the CARES Act suspended the PAMA price cuts that had been scheduled for 2021. In addition, the new round of data collection has been delayed another year into the first quarter of 2022 and will continue to use data from the first quarter of 2019. This is important as it allows ample time to implement the recommendations of the MedPAC study to identify a better way to collect the data that reflects private market rates as Congress initially intended.Third, the Act appropriates $100 billion to health care providers for expenses or lost revenues that are attributed to COVID-19. Quest received approximately $65 million from the initial tranche of the $30 billion distributed to providers earlier this month. Finally, Medicare sequestration will be suspended from May to December this year. This 8-month sequestration holiday will afford us a small benefit.Now, turning to the M&A environment, we continue to make progress. We're pleased that we completed the Memorial Hermann transaction as well as its integration phase, and this is an important complex relationship with a very prominent healthcare system.There are other transactions in the pipeline that we were very close to announcing before the crisis. While they are on hold, our strong conviction is that these discussions will resume, which will be in the third quarter and will be a very good position at that point to complete those transactions.And then finally, I'd like to share some thoughts on industry dynamics, post crisis. Given the many challenges that hospitals will face, we expect many to be open to discussions about Quest and how we can help them achieve their lab strategy. At the same time, we know that many smaller regional labs have had their own challenges. This could produce opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. If any, the crisis could be an additional catalyst to drive the consolidation we've been forecasting for several years.Before I close, I just want to say once again how proud I'm to be part of the Quest team at this historic time. Our employees have stepped up in every way to serve the nation during this time of need. The challenges have brought all of us at Quest closer together, changing the way we work and collaborate, making us stronger as a team. We have become more agile, customer-focused and unified. We will emerge from this crisis stronger with substantial opportunities in front of us.Now, I would like to turn it over to Mark, who will take you through the results as well as our thoughts on our financial position. Mark? To summarize, we were very pleased with January and February performance, but saw a material decline in last two weeks of March. We are managing the company for the long-term and are taking a series of actions to protect our financial flexibility.Quest has been at the tip of the spear in responding to the crisis, and we will continue to play a critical role in the next phase of containing COVID-19. While there's uncertainty in the near-term, we look forward to the gradual improving conditions we see in front of us. Eventually, the healthcare system will start to return to normal and when that happens, Quest will emerge from the crisis stronger with significant opportunities in front of us.Now, we'd be happy to take any questions you have. Operator? Good morning, Ann. Appreciate that. Sure. Yes. All right, Ann. All right. So all around antibody testing and serology testing. So as you read our press release yesterday, we launched our broad implementation of serology testing. We actually brought up a week or so ago, our first limited LDT laboratory developed tests on the EUROIMMUN platform. And we did that in two of our facilities and we did that for limited customers, hospitals and at risk individuals. So we had some experience with it.And then second, as we brought up our first platform, which is an app platform, and we announced last night, that will -- platform is in many of our sites and we will bring that up quickly. And then we will have a few other platforms we bring up in the course of April into May. And that will allow us to get to that 200,000 tests per day number by mid-May. We've run seven days a week, 24 hours a day. That's about 1.5 million per week. And so you can think about 6 million per month.Now, to answer your questions, we're not stopping there. We've got more capacity in front of us. We are always dependent though on the capacity coming out of the IVD manufacturers with the reagents that we need. So somewhat of the limiting factor has less to do with us where we have lab capacity, but more related to the reagents and the supply chain from our suppliers. So we're working with them as well. So that's what we're willing to say we'll have in the month of May.Now, how broad would this be? What we announced in a press release and you see the guidance from the FDA, while we do believe are several things, one is after a certain number of days and the best indication is after 14 days of being infected, the person can have an IGG response. That's the last antibody. And therefore, it is obviously a good measurement that you have been infected in the past. It's important to those individuals that have not been tested and made it -- might have been asymptomatic. So it's another good indication of infection rate within the geography or within a population. That's number one.Point number two is based upon other viruses. We believe that there may be immunity for some period of time. This is what we need to study. And that's why we have the conditions on our press release that we need to have more evidence and this is why we need to do more of it. The vast majority of viruses in the past have had immunity for a period of time, but we need to confirm this with evidence. So with that said, I would share with you we have tremendous interest in both continuation of the molecular testing that has to be done going forward. And then second is combining it with serology testing. This is happening at the state level for broad infrastructure needs.You might have seen a new announcement by the state of California. They're going to start to test asymptomatic members -- excuse me, citizens within California. Second is employers. We have actually leveraged our capability with our employer population health business, which we used to call our wellness business, where we have this product called Blueprint for Wellness and we work with employers. And we leverage that now in building on those relationships with employers in their return to work programs. And so that's giving us a nice leverage point. And the return to work programs vary by industry. It matters a great deal if you're a manufacturer and you have plants, or if you're an office environment or if you're a food processor, so we have a number of engagements going on with employers. And those employers are working with their states and are working with their cities and towns and local communities, as they think about what needs to happen and within those geographies, because there is wide variation, that's what's happening with the constraints around return to work and shelter-in-place in schools.And then finally, we are working with the states. Many of the states have mounted now task forces to look at what needs to happen next with test -- testing. As I said, California has made now a broader announcement of what they want to do to expand testing. We see this coming from out from a number of states. We're right in the middle of all those conversations. In fact yesterday, I did a press conference with the governor of Connecticut, Governor of Lamont in Connecticut, where we work proactively with one of our partners, Hartford HealthCare and expanding testing in the state of Connecticut.So as Mark said, there's substantial opportunities in front of us both for the molecular testing, which has to be done to rule in, rule out COVID-19. And then you, coupled with the opportunities we see for serology or antibody testing as well for overall surveillance within a population and returning to work. So a good opportunity in front of us. Thank you, Ann. Hey, Ralph. Yes, Mark. Hi. Yes, yes. Sure, sure. So let me start, then Mark will I'm sure, add to it. First of all, Invigorate continues. That's a regular cadence and one of our two strategies that we have is to drive operational excellence and a portion of that is our efficiency program and we continue to look for that 3% of our cost basis for years. So that hasn't changed. So we continue to work on those programs. And in that regard, one of our flagship programs that we talk about is the new Clifton Laboratory that will allow us to consolidate the footprint to allow us to put in some new platforms, the immunoassay platform we talked about in the past, that project continues. But what I'll say, we're in the process of refreshing our plans because some of those plans might change. So, for instance, construction in the state of New Jersey might slip some. So some of those might change.And then secondly, some of the expectations around costs within a given year in terms of magnitude might be lower because some of it is volume dependent. However, in terms of percentage, if we're at lower volume levels, they'll be even higher percentages given some of this is fixed. So we're refreshing our perspective, but the goal of getting at least 3% of our cost basis for a year still stands. But we haven't provided an absolute number beyond the 3% in the past. So, Mark, would you like to add to it? Mark, you want to take that? Yes. So volume has not turned around. We said it stabilize. So when you asked about whether things in March and now we're seeing them pick up, what I would say is that, we worked across what we call our clinical franchises, and there's absolutely differences depending on the acuteness of the condition and the necessity of the testing. But there's some very acute important areas of adjustments and like cancer screening led testing in children, etcetera, that are down significantly just because physician offices are closed and people are uncomfortable going out, or people being told not to go out except for extreme necessary situations. So while we absolutely see some levels of difference across the testing venue and how much it's down, some more than 50% to 60%, some less than that. I can't tell you that we've seen more discretionary type testing come back dramatically yet. Good morning, Jack. Yes, we're doing well. Let me write it down, Jack. Yes. So let me start. So on reimbursements, we were really encouraged by CMS upping the rate to $100. We're current -- currently working -- approaching all the commercial insurance companies on what their rate will be. And we don't have an answer on that, but we're encouraged that CMS went up and that's usually an indication that gives us leverage working with the commercial insurance companies. So more to come on that. Second, as Mark said, we still do not have the CMS rate for a serology testing. That's an important fact for us to establish reimbursement for serology, which would be, as we said, a significant opportunity. As far as scale, I mentioned in my comments, we are driving capacity gains going forward. We're bringing up some new platforms, trying to get some additional units. We're looking for different approaches of how we can get more productivity and more capacity from our existing platforms. And that is on the molecular side, will equally be on the serology side. And we have actually been asked by the White House task force to think creatively of what we can do to expand our capacity beyond what we have done so far. So we're thinking our way through that.As I said, we're right now at 50,000 tests per day, and that's for molecular. We're trying to get plans in place to bring us north of that number. But nothing that we can say at this point, but we're aggressively pursuing it. We are encouraged by what we saw last night come out of the Senate and hopefully the House will deliberate and we'll get the next round of funding. And some portion of that will come to us, because we do need to continue to do the testing in this country. And it so depended on both tests happening, molecular testing, as well as the serology tests going forward. So encouraged with the progress we're making, more in front of us. And yes, we will push hard to get more out.And as I said earlier, when I am asked the question about capacity on serology we have to look at the whole supply chain, the front end and the back end. So, yes, we have the lab capacity. But one of the issues we had on molecular side is not having the supplies, the swabs in the right places. We actually have shipped out in excess of a million swabs and we haven't resulted in excess of a million. So we have some inventory sitting out there. And also on the back end, it's very dependent upon IVD manufacturers providing us with the reagents and the kits o be able to increase our capacity as well. So we're working with them. And I can tell you, we're getting a lot of help from the task force, the White House, help from the states, everyone is rolled up their sleeves and trying to get more capacity out there. So there will be more coming, but what we've said so far is what we feel comfortable so far, I would say. Mark, you like to add to that? And just to remind everyone there is a difference. And hopefully it's clear between the molecular testing, which requires a health care professional in most cases to do the specimen collection. And in many cases, they're protected with full garb of personal protection equipment. So that created a bottleneck of people getting tested. And we've worked on some different approaches to that. As a matter of fact, in the Walmart, the Walmart sites, we have observed self collection where actually we have an approved kit from the FDA where it is a nasal swab, but the person can use that swab themselves, but it has to be observed by health care professional.But in the case of Walmart, what actually happens is the person drives up, they provide the order to a health care worker in those parking lots that aren't nearly as protective as what we need to do before, they confirm all the information. The health care worker provides information that close up their window and they do the self collection themselves and it's observed through the window. So that's proven to be highly efficient. And we're looking at other ways of collecting that trend on the molecular side. So that has been a little bit of a bottleneck too on that and we're improving how we get the specimens.Remember, serology is blood based. And so it leverages all our infrastructure. And so as you know we have 12,000 phlebotomists, we have 2,200 patient service centers, we have 4,000 phlebotomists and physicians' offices. And so when this starts to light up, that provides us a nice opportunity to collect those specimens quickly and potentially tag those orders onto other orders that might be coming in from the health care delivery system as health care starts to turn on. So when you think about serology and you think about the front end being much simpler and much more pervasive and leveraging everything already have, not exceptional like the molecular test has been so far. Good morning, Ricky. Mark, you want to start with that? Yes. So we've built up a model looking at our business from multiple perspectives. One, Mark, said earlier we have variation by types of clinical franchise business we have, some have declined greater, some have declined less. And we're thinking about why that has happened and when there is turning back on to health care delivery system, how quickly they will come back up. So that's one. Second is we do have differences between what's happened in the hospital environment and also physician environment. And so as hospitals start to change what they are going to allow back in their doors, that will change. That is well. And then third, we do see a difference in what's happening by state and by cities. And so we've tracked all of that. And what we have found, as we said in my introductory comments, all metropolitan areas have dropped. Obviously, some of those areas like New York, New Jersey, and now Lawson is starting to light up, parts of Florida have come in later than the West Coast. So we're tracking all of that and we're doing that because we're also trying to see when things might start to turn back on.So you start to see some of the individual states starting to loosen up their shelter-in-place and started to loosen up employers coming back to work. And so we're watching that carefully, so we can kind of indicate where we need to bring back our capacity. We talked about our costs programs. We've talked about furloughs. I want to make sure it's clear. Our furlough program was a program where we offered it to employees, but they had requested from us and we had to grant it. And so we grant out furlough. It allows them to continue to benefits request, but also allows them to collect unemployment and apply to the CARES Act for a weekly stipend. But it also allows us to bring them back. And so they have an obligation to come back when we need them. So as these states start to turn back on, we will bring back the capacity we need to turn it back on. But we're watching that Ricky carefully to understand what's gone down and when did we start to see some recovery by state and by clinical franchise going forward. Hi, Steve. Appreciate it. Yes, well, to start with, if you look at the numbers that come out of the White House in their press briefings, we said that we've done over a million tests. We're close to 25% of the total country's testing. Obviously, we have better percentages, a higher percentage in certain states grew up broader presence. And some states are really just ramping up their testing in a bigger way. If they look at Florida, where we have a big presence that's just really started to light up in a big way. As far as the opportunity in front of us, we are encouraged by the opportunity we see. We're waiting to see how quickly it does ramp up and just what kind of pickup there will be from physicians on serological testing and how fast that ramp will be. But we're building enough capacity to respond to it. And again, a lot of our capacity will be highly depended upon the equipment we have and the reagents we get. So if there's more, we're hopeful we can build on what we have, but we are very limited by that. So we're going to keep our eye on it, push it as one of the two testing categories that should be done to respond to the virus and see how quickly it ran. So we will keep you updated as we learn more. I would say both. And I think there's as I mentioned earlier, we're working with employers because many employers are trying to understand how they bring back to employees. And there's wide variation in employers, but these employee programs will both test your employees for the virus with the molecular tests, and they'll also test them for the antibody tests. And we might do those, particularly the antibody test in different types of venues like corporate sponsored events where we can -- now where we can draw the specimen quickly as we do, corporate events they were for flu shots or Blueprint for Wellness program. So we already have that capability of ramping up these corporate programs. And those will be quite different than the traditional way of doing testing that we have with physicians or hospitals today. Hi, Derik. Mark, you start the first one, I had a hard time hearing the first question. Mark, did you pick it up? Yes. We see an opportunity. So if you think about what's happening within the healthcare provider market, we're an indication that volumes are down. You have all the data on possible missions. You have data on physician visits. You see it reflected in our volumes being down. And so hospitals and as we all know, 50% of physicians now are employed by hospital systems are going to be struggling as they enter this quarter. And we'll be looking at opportunities to become more efficient, reduce their cost, generate some cash. And so we believe there could be an opportunity for us to continue our consolidation strategy in the back half the year, it is more of these systems and some of those dialogues we've had for years maybe become more active now because there's now more likely to think about creative ways that they can work with a company like Quest on their lab strategy.So we think that could be another catalysts for consolidation. And as you know, this is also a fragmented industry. There's other regional, especially laboratories. And it also might have worsened other opportunities for us to consolidate. So we believe this is a good opportunity in the long-term for us to continue our strategy of accelerating our growth and consolidating the marketplace. And in the short-term, it's difficult, but in the mid to long-term, we think it could be yet another opportunity to do what we've said we wanted to do. Hey, Matt. I think I'll add is what I just said earlier. There is going to be a lot of pent up demand from patients. And Mark said there's been a lot of physician offices that have been canceled, postponed and delayed. And so they will start to come back to the system. When that will be, we will vary by city and by state. And so that's what I said earlier in the comments we're tracking all that. So one could think later in the quarter you start to see some recovery. There'll also be those physicians' offices in those hospital systems want to bring back in those patients as well. So we're actually going to do a survey of our customers to get a perspective of what they're thinking about when they turn back on their offices or open up their offices with extended hours, extended workdays. I think people are now thinking that the summer won't be the same summer. July and August won't be the heavy vacation period. So we're watching all that. But as Mark said, too early and too much too much uncertainty around it for us to give you anything more than we provided. But we're keeping an eye, our eyes on it closely. Hi, Don. Yes, absolutely. Our strategy to accelerate growth continues. One of those strategies is to continue to build our advanced diagnostics platform. Again, that's all genetics and molecular. The acquisition that we did complete early this year was a nice platform capability acquisition. We feel good about that company coming into Quest Diagnostics. The integration is going well. There's a lot of opportunities in front of us with a genetic base testing. And our plans for that do not change given the crisis step that we have. Hey, good morning, Lisa. Yes. So, we've been working with all the Telehealth providers and platforms in this many different models as we know. So we do see that as another channel, if you will, or another type of capability as health care provision. And this crisis has burned some of those models there and established some credibility and some comfort with patients. And so we do believe that will become a larger percentage of our volume. And when you have those engagements, many of you on the call probably have had those engagements, they do order testing. And then it follows the workflow that we have for testing within Quest Diagnostics. And then depending upon the model we've used in the platforms, the use is telemedicine going to be your primary care physician or would they be an adjunct to it and therefore, we have the connectivity to connect back to the EMR in the primary care physician. So good opportunity. We have strong relationships with many of the Telehealth platforms, big and small. We actually are always prospecting what new startups and ventures are coming up with new capabilities. There's been a lot of new front end capabilities, triage capabilities that you see to run COVID-19, which has been interesting, some of which we're very well of -- we're aware of and have good relations with. So it is changing and this crisis has brought more visibility to it. So we believe that's a good opportunity for us and we're very well positioned with those companies going forward. Hey, Erin. Yes. What I'll say, Erin, is it can't hurt. This crisis has brought to the forefront the importance of testing. And I never believed when I joined this company over eight years ago, that would be on the front page of every news story in America and all over the media, but we are. So it's much easier now for us to make our case with members of Congress, to the administration in HSS with the value of testing and the need for us to get fairly reimbursed. And also to reinforce the intent of Congress in making sure we get a new process put in place that properly reflects the market rates. So it is actually a very good fact for us. We're going to leverage that. Just to remind everyone the CARES Act did change the timing. I had those in my prepared remarks. And then second is we still have the lawsuit going on, which is still happening. And we're hopeful we'll get a decision sometime this year on that. Hey, Eric. Yes. Mark, do you want to start on the $65 million? Yes. And I'll just say the package that was just approved by the Senate last night, we don't have a lot of clarity of any specificity underneath the hood, if you will. And then also, as you know, it's going to be debated in the House. So we'll be watching and giving them input as they refine it. But it is critical to get America turn back on, that we have the resources and we're properly reimbursed and paid for the work we do. And as I said, we are the leader for a portion -- a large portion of the country is testing. And therefore, I would expect that some portion of that money we could tap into as a resource for us, but it's uncertain at this time what it will be and if any. Hi, Brian. Yes. So just to give you a scale again of what our different businesses. Of our business, roughly a billion of it before crisis was coming from hospitals. To give you an idea of the scale and -- and then a billion of our business is -- are related services like our population health business with employers, our employer drug testing business, our insurance business. And so the remainder is really physician driven, okay? So, roughly $6 billion of our $8 billion before crisis was -- is physician driven. So those referrals are obviously very important because that's where we get the vast majority of our volume. Sure. Well, thanks everyone, for joining us today. Glad we got everyone's questions and we appreciate your continued support and you have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $1.82 billion, down 3.7% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 3.8% compared to the prior year. As Steve noted earlier, our business performance was strong in January and February, but we experienced a substantial decline in volumes in March. Volume measured by the number of requisitions decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes declined 2.7%.Before describing some of the volume trends we saw in March and early April, I do want to spend a moment on the strong performance of our business prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through February, year-to-date total revenue growth was just over 4%, with organic revenue growth of just over 3.5%.Total volume growth was strong at 6.3%. Volume through February included a calendar benefit due in part to leap year, as well as mild winter weather. Adjusting for these benefits and the impact of acquisitions, organic volume growth in the first two months of 2020 was nearly 4.5%, indicating that the strong progress you made in 2019 continued into 2020.As we moved into March, we started to see single-digit volume declines through the first two weeks of the month. Stay-at-home measures were implemented in several states by the third week of March, volume declines accelerated to nearly 40%. And by the last week of the month, volume declines across the business started to approach 50%.So far in April, we have indications that volume declines have stabilized in the 50% to 60% range. These declines include the benefit of COVID-19 molecular testing, which has been running at approximately 30,000 tests per day on average or approximately 6% volume growth through April.Revenue per requisition declined 1.2% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher reimbursement pressure. Unit price headwinds were slightly more than 2% in the first quarter in line with our prior expectations. This includes the impact of PAMA, which amounted to a headwind of approximately 100 basis points.Reported operating income was $175 million or 9.6% of revenues compared to $248 million or 13.2% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $225 million or 12.3% of revenues compared to $286 million or 15.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was entirely due to declining revenue in March as a result of COVID-19.Note that operating margin was up meaningfully year-over-year through February, primarily driven by the strong volume and revenue growth highlighted previously. Reported EPS was $0.73 in the quarter compared to a $1.20 a year-ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.94 compared to $1.40 last year.Cash provided by operations was $247 million in the first quarter versus $275 million last year. I'd like to take a moment to discuss our financial position and our ability to access additional capital. As of March 31, we had $342 million of cash on hand and $1.3 billion of borrowing capacity was available under existing credit facilities. These facilities consist of $529 million available under our secured receivables credit facility and $750 million available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of March 31.In April, we borrowed $100 million under our secured receivables credit facility and $100 million under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Our secured receivables facility is subject to certain financial covenants with respect to the receivables that comprise the borrowing base and secure the borrowings under the facility.Our unsecured revolving credit facility is also subject to certain financial covenants to limitations on indebtedness. In particular, the unsecured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a leverage ratio of no more than 3.5x EBITDA as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of March 31, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants.The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to impact our ability to comply with these covenants, beginning as early as the end of the second quarter. In this scenario, we would not be able to borrow against these credit facilities and then lenders would have the right to demand payment of any amount outstanding.We have been in advanced discussions with our lead lender regarding an amendment to certain financial covenants of our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe this would provide us with the necessary flexibility to remain in compliance for the remainder of 2020.Based on these discussions and the strong support from our lead lender, we are confident we will be able to enter into this amendment later in the quarter. If, for some reason we are unable to enter into this amendment, we believe that our investment grade credit rating would provide us with access to alternate sources of financing. Finally, as noted in our earnings release this morning, we are also suspending share repurchases through the end of the year under our existing repurchase authorization.To summarize, we believe our financial position and ability to access additional capital is strong and our Board of Directors remain committed to the company's quarterly dividend at this time. As many of you know, we withdrew our 2020 guidance on March 31, given the unprecedented uncertainty caused by COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to provide updated 2020 guidance at a more appropriate time when visibility improves around the impact of COVID-19 and the duration of current stay-at-home measures in place across the United States.While we aren't providing guidance today, I'd like to share some details for you to consider as you build your models. As many of you know, our business is one of high fixed costs. We have modeled a number of different volume scenarios over the near to medium term and at this point our best estimate is that volumes for the business excluding COVID-19 testing will be down 50% to 60% in the second quarter.Once the COVID-19 crisis mitigates or passes and stay-at-home measures begin to lift, we believe our volume will slowly improve but to a lower level in 2020 than where we started the year. While we have taken several cost reduction steps, which we first shared in an 8-K on April 13, these steps are not sufficient to enable us to generate a profit at this volume assumption. If the conditions affecting lower lab utilization continue throughout the second quarter, it is highly likely we will incur a net loss.Molecular COVID-19 testing does serve as a partial offset to the volume declines we're experiencing across the rest of the business. We expect that demand for molecular COVID-19 testing will remain high throughout the second quarter and likely the foreseeable future. In addition to the uncertainty around health care utilization in lab volume trends, another unknown is the impact of serology testing. We believe there's significant potential in serology testing, but reimbursement and customer demand are still in front of us.I will now turn it back to Steve. Steve? Sure, Steve. So, Ralph, the statement around net loss would be a volume inclusive of COVID testing continue to be down around 50% to 60%. Now, what that does not include is serology. So as I said in my prepared remarks, the -- well, we're encouraged by the potential demand and a lot of the things that Steve just explained are either in mid-term or a late stage conversations around stepping up some testing for government entities, for employers, etcetera. We haven't been performing that test. Obviously, we just launched serology, so we wanted to be cautious about forecasting in any way how meaningful serology would be.But based on all the things we've talked about, it could be significant. We also don't know the reimbursement rate yet, but hopefully fairly soon. And I think the trigger for commercial rates will largely be based on where CMS comes out. So we're all waiting on that. So that net loss comment and the 50% to 60% would include the current level of PCR where we said we're averaging about 30,000 tests a day. It's offsetting about 6% of our loss, but it does not contemplate significant upside if it happens from serology testing at some point in this quarter. And then on a margin perspective, obviously, if we losing money, the answer to that, but from a drop through perspective, because we are high fixed costs and we've already counted on as much adjustment to our cost structure as we can optimize through our furloughs, through reduced hours to some of those salary reductions for the next twelve weeks. We're largely fixed cost after that.So therefore any sort of volume changes would likely be at a very high ratio, if things were to get worse. As we said, we believe we've bottomed out because we've seen some stability over the last couple of weeks. There's some encouraging signs in some of the areas that were most impacted because not all geographies are created equal. So, some of those are bouncing back a little bit. But at this point, we wanted to be cautious, we wanted to be conservative, we wanted to tell you what we know today. And therefore the outlook for the quarter is not based on speculation. That is based on what we're seeing and what we know today. Yes, I think Steve summarized it well. A lot of our Invigorate is around volume related activities, whether it's labor, whether it's our lab throughput, whether it's the draws we're doing in a patient service centers. So any sort of savings, certainly will continue as we implement some of the cost improvement efficiency opportunities, but they will be proportional. So obviously the dollars will be less. We always talked about 3% on a $6 billion plus cost base. Obviously if the cost base goes down, given lower volumes, you can expect lower dollar savings. The other thing I would add is that a lot of our efficiency programs are, design along the normal level of testing. So it is difficult to operate as efficiently when you lose half your volume on a given line, some places even more than that and given assays.So the efficiency around reagents and other things operational, things like labor flexibility and so on. So there is some offset to our Invigorate program and lost efficiencies, while we continue at this low level of volume because we're not going to rescale our business obviously to that extent. We're considering this to be temporary at some point, even though I caution we don't expect to be fully back to the level we were prior to COVID. We at some point we'll be back to much more significant testing. I mean, some of our cancer screening is down, very, very significantly. We all know at some point we have to come back and do that work because cancer doesn't go away. So, Invigorate will continue. It will be proportional. There will be some offsets because of the inherent lower efficiencies at these volume levels. Yes. Let me add a couple of things. So, Jack, almost without exception and certainly all of the national payers and large regional payers, the commercial reimbursement for the PCR test was based on the rate for Medicare and was not a subset or proportion, which obviously it's in the industry practice, but was with at or above the CMS rate. So therefore, I'm confident that we're going to do well. As you know, CMS has updated this price. We are in advanced discussions and I think it's very probable that most, if not all the company, the commercial payers will recognize the higher rate from CMS and our commercial rates will change. So I'm optimistic there.In terms of the second half of the year, as we said, we're very careful. We -- none of us know how this is going to play out, but you can do the math. So if you know, the capacity for serology is in any way meet the demand and Steve talked about 200,000 a day, you have the PCR currently today at 50,000 tests a day combined, those represent almost half of our normal daily testing volume. And given that we don't know serology yet, but we're hopeful the price will be fairly close to an average requisition price for us.And we know that the PCR testing is above that with the CMS rate revision. One would assume that the value of a requisition will be somewhat similar to what our average is today. So, again, I don't know how much the core volume will recover, how quickly it will happen, etcetera. But if there is some recovery and if there is some high level of demand for the COVID-19 testing, as we're all hearing publicly, then you can do the numbers and you can see that the back half of the year could be very different than the second quarter. Yes. So, Ricky, our Medicaid revenues, as you know, are low single digits. Currently Medicaid is typically lower priced than Medicare, typically priced lower than commercial rates. Now when you talk about unemployment, absolutely, we've thought about that. And one of the reasons amongst many that we're cautious about whether volumes bounce back to where they were earlier in the year was the potential for continued unemployment higher than obviously we've had in the number of years. And so, therefore we are recognizing that potential as we think about the balance of the year. And quite frankly, going forward, the other dynamic is if you look historically and obviously we try to do that, I'm sure others have to try to predict what might happen this time, there are some notable differences. One of them is the Affordable Care Act does provide more of a safety net for those who lose their jobs. So that's a positive.But the other thing is, given the magnitude and the speed at which people have become unemployed, it's really difficult to model and predict what that might do to utilization. We are being very cognizant of collectability, not just from patients, but from hospital systems, from physicians. So we're monitoring very, very closely our receivables and collection rates. And we are anticipating likely headwinds on collectability of our revenue going forward, given everything that's going on. So that's certainly on our radar. But the other dynamic is, given that utilization has -- in the last couple of months dropped significantly, one might assume that a greater portion of our revenues would be coming from patients because people will be more slowly or not getting through their deductible and calendar basis relative to where they may have in the past.So we've looked at all of these things and that obviously it will be a headwind. But there's no model we can point to historically to say this is exactly what it means. I mean, in the last significant recession, our collectability rate actually did not materially decline. Utilization was impacted, but we did not have a higher rate of what used to be bad debt. Now it's mostly patient concessions. But given all the dynamics this time, we think that that's a likely possibility. However, you do have the safety net through the Affordable Care Act of expansion of Medicaid in many states. So how all those pieces put together? I can't fully predict, but trust me we're thinking about all that. And as we see trends and as we understand those impacts, as always, we'll be extremely transparent around what we're seeing. Yes, the one other thing I'd add is that while shelter-in-place certainly has a significant impact on utilization and some of the greatest volume decreases were in those geographies, as we mentioned, every major metropolitan area in the country was seeing significant declines. Maybe not to the same extent in late March and then into early April, regardless of whether we had shelter-in-place. We are not as true outside the urban areas, but in the metropolitan areas people were being cautious, including physician offices, etcetera in -- how they were accepting patients and whether they were staying open or not and patients were being cautious about whether going out or not, given all the media attention and so on and so forth. So while there is absolutely a correlation with shelter-in-place rules, it's more than that, that has been depressing utilization. Go ahead. If you wouldn't mind repeating, you talked about future wellness. Yes. So on that one, it's very hard to predict. And just like you're asking, it could go either direction. We don't have any sort of crystal ball better than anybody else. Obviously, in my prepared remarks and then one of my answers, I expressed a concern that we're deferring critical diagnostic testing that's important for our health and well-being. And one would hope that at some point we say, that's really important, we've got to find a way to get it done regardless of what risks might be around COVID and whether that bounces back to where it was before or whether to your point could it potentially be more because COVID is obviously much riskier for those with pre-existing conditions that we're all familiar with and that means we want even more tightly manage that. I certainly can't predict it. I'm not sure, if Steve wants to comment anything differently. So that's unclear. But as we said, as we progressed through this and we all learned together, we will be highly transparent around what we're seeing so that you all can understand as much as possible how that is playing out. Then, Steve, the other one was on PAMA lab consolidation. Yes. So as I said, we are not going to speculate, because it shows too hard to predict. So, yes, there's absolutely some potential for volume bouncing back from where it is now. We're not assuming any material improvement for the quarter, not because we know that won't happen, but because we think that's the appropriate point of view to take in order to make sure people are aware of some of the potential downside. We also haven't built in any significant serology volumes into those assumptions. And we've heard a lot of discussion today around that potential demand and ramping up fairly quickly. We don't know to what extent. So I don't want anyone to assume we have too much precision around this 50% to 60% down for the quarter and a, net operating loss. But that's potential if it does stay where it is and we don't get significant serology testing or significant upwards in our PCR testing. I don't know if you want to add anything, Steve, to that. Good morning. Yes. So that was a unique situation. They created a pot of money of $30 billion emergency relief. There were no stipulations for how you would get that money. In fact, we are surprised, it showed up in our bank account. It was based on proportional billings to Medicare and that probably divided up at $30 billion. So anyone who had billed Medicare in the prior year got a portion of that. The other parts of this bill are, for various aspects of getting testing up and running. I will turn to Steve to cover some of that, but there's nothing else that quite mirrors that emergency relief fund where we got the $65 billion. So while there's opportunities for us to utilize some of the other funds, it's not as straightforward and it's not as simple as what happened with that emergency relief fund. So, Steve. Good morning, Brian. And then on serology testing, Brian, well, we've never shared a dollar amount. You can look at some of the CMS rates. We've made it clear through our trade association that we don't think the crosswalk that they probably would default to is sufficient. Obviously you saw -- in the first case for the PCR, we weren't successful initially. They established a rate and then they reconsidered, looked at it and almost doubled it. So we're hopeful that in the case of serology, there's some pretty compelling evidence and detail that we're going to get a serology rate for the COVID testing that's more commensurate with the cost that its -- we're going to incur in order to perform it."

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without written consent, of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.  Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please. \nShawn Bevec : Thank you and good morning. I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President; Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer and Jim Davis, our Executive Vice President, General Diagnostics and Chief Executive Officer-Elect. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn and thanks everyone for joining us today. Over the past two years, our 50,000 quest employees have risen to the challenge of COVID-19, innovating, persevering, and remaining committed to the patients and customers we serve. While doing so, they also grew our base business by more than 19% in 2021, achieving record levels. I'm extremely proud of what we have accomplished as a team. So we have a lot of news to cover this morning. And I want to get into that so we can have your questions. So let's get started.  So first, I'll start by sharing some color on the leadership transition we've announced this morning. Then we'll review our performance for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2021. And then finally Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial outlook for 2022.  So as you have seen, in our announcement this morning, we've begun implementing a gradual leadership succession plan, under which Jim Davis, Executive Vice President of General Diagnostics will succeed me to become Chief Executive Officer on November 1, 2022. At that time, I will continue to serve on the Quest Board of Directors as Executive Chairman.  Quest Diagnostics is a great company that is well-positioned to continue to deliver shareholder value. As I approached a decade in the role, the Board and I determined that now is the right time to begin to turn over the helm to a new leader. Jim Davis is extremely well qualified to be CEO, having managed a large part of this company in his role as Executive Vice President. He has deep knowledge of Quest, the healthcare industry and the corporate world, gained through more than 35 years of business experience. Jim is widely respected and will be a strong CEO. When I took this role nearly 10 years ago, Quest was not growing, nor realizing its potential. We launched a new strategy, our new Quest to drive transformational change. To drive that change, we built a new leadership team, and Jim has been a key member of that team. We built a business strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. To drive growth, we focused on improving relationships with health plans, hospital health systems, and expanding fast growing businesses, and advanced diagnostics, and consumer testing.  In addition, we've added about 2% revenue growth on average through accretive, strategically aligned acquisitions over the last several years. We have driven operational excellence, and our Invigorate program has consistently improved quality and customer experience, while generating 3% productivity each year. And we've made more inclusive by increasing the diversity on our Board, and amongst our management ranks.  Finally, we established Quest for Health Equity in 2020, over $100 million committed to reduce healthcare disparities among underserved in the United States, particularly communities of color. I am very proud of what we've accomplished together. And if you consider the opportunities in front of us, in many ways, we're just getting started.  We have a strong team and Jim as a key leader in our transformation. He runs our General Diagnostics business, which accounts for more than 80% of revenues and three quarters of our employees. He manages operations, including sales and marketing, patient services, logistics, laboratories, billing and customer services. He also oversees the Drive Operational Excellence strategy, which includes our Invigorate program. He has provided enterprise oversight for pandemic response. And if that wasn't enough, he's also lead the development of Quest ESG strategy.  So Jim, congratulations. I look forward to working very closely with you through this transition. \nJames E. Davis : Hey, thanks Steve, and I really look forward to working closely with you over the next eight months, and ensuring a very successful transition. It's a tremendous honor to have the opportunity to succeed you in Quest and lead Quest into the next stage of our growth. We have a very powerful vision in Quest of empowering better health and diagnostic insights.  Our business strategy is straightforward and well understood. And our company has never been more central to patients and to the health care system, as we've seen during this pandemic. I really look forward to working with the management team and all 50,000 employees to build on the strong foundation that Quest has put in place. Quest's future is really bright. And we're extremely well positioned to continue to create value for shareholders, and all that we serve.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Jim. Now at the same time Mark is planning to retire this year. Mark has been in his role for more than eight years, and helped navigate us to the strong position where it is today. We have begun a process in which I will be working closely with Jim to identify Quest's new CFO, and Mark will participate in the selection process. He will remain in the role through the transition.  Mark, I want to thank you for your many contributions, your partnership and your friendship. You've been a key member of our leadership team and we have transformed Quest and accelerated its growth. \nMark Guinan : Thanks, Dave. I appreciate the kind words. I just want to take a minute to say that I'm proud to be part of an important company that makes a positive contribution to the country, and I've enjoyed being part of it. Now it's time for me to step back and retire. I'm looking forward to participating in the process to identify my successor who can support Steve and Jim in Quest's next phase of growth. \nSteve Rusckowski: Now turning to our results, we closed out 2021 with another record year of revenue, earnings and cash from operations. Our base business recovered throughout the year, and we experienced strong demand for COVID-19 testing services. So for the full year 2021, total revenues grew by more than 14% to $10.8 billion.  Earnings per share increased by nearly 49% on a reported basis to $15.55, and more than 27% on an adjusted basis to $14.24. Cash provided by operations increased by more than 11% to $2.2 billion. And for the fourth quarter, total revenues were $2.7 billion, a decrease of roughly 9% versus 2020 when COVID-19 volumes were surging. Earnings per share were $3.12 on a reported basis, and $3.33 on an adjusted basis, both down approximately 26% versus the prior year.  So I'd like to share some perspective on the role of COVID-19 testing going forward. A lot of progress has been made in the battle against COVID-19. But we believe it isn't going away anytime soon. Our molecular product began this year strong, with volumes peaking in January. Testing will continue to play an important part of managing COVID-19, and we believe that molecular testing remains the gold standard. We continued to perform well throughout the surge, maintaining average turnaround times of two days or less for COVID molecular testing.  We will continue to maintain appropriate testing capacities and staffing levels to be prepared for any additional surges throughout this year if they emerge. We also continue to believe there will be a bigger role for serology testing, and how we measure COVID-19 protection going forward. Ultimately we expect COVID-19 testing to eventually more flu-like and become a permanent part of our portfolio going forward.  Now turning to our base business, we continue to make progress executing our two point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, while we delivered 2% revenue growth on our base business from acquisitions again last year. In the fourth quarter, we acquired the assets of Labtech Diagnostics, a regional independent laboratory, serving physicians and patients primarily in South and North Carolina, Georgia and Florida. This is the first full service laboratory owned by Quest in South Carolina.  We also recently announced our acquisition of Pack Health, a patient engagement company that helps individuals adopt healthier behaviors to improve outcomes. This acquisition will bolster our extended care capabilities. Since 2012, we have completed more than 40 acquisitions, including outreach laboratories, regional independent laboratories and capability enhancing deals. And over the last four years, we've achieved our target of greater than the average of 2% revenue growth on our base business each year from acquisitions.  And then finally, our M&A appetite  remains strong. In 2021, we took full advantage of our strong health plan access, which is approximately 90% of all commercial insurer advice in this country. We also made good progress working together with our plans to help companies and their employees save money by reducing denials and out of network leakage. Our clients also recognize the value of working with us and we have grown our health plan revenues faster than our overall revenues to the best level we've ever seen.  Hospital health system revenues have grown more than 20% compared to 2019 levels, excluding COVID-19 testing, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contract. Our performance in 2021 benefited from our two largest PLS contracts to-date, Hackensack Meridian Health and Memorial Hermann. Altogether our PLS business without COVID-19 exceeded a record $500 million in annual revenue last year. Hospitals continuously faced pressure throughout the pandemic. Post-pandemic we believe the same will be true.  We believe there will be a continued consolidation and ongoing challenges that afford Quest an opportunity to implement our flexible solutions that help hospitals become more effective and productive. Advanced diagnostics is critical to the future of healthcare. We're building strong momentum in our key growth drivers, which include consumer and hereditary genetics, oncology and pharma services. In 2021 these test categories accounted for several 100 million dollars of advanced diagnostics portfolio, and they are growing more than 25% versus 2020, and nearly 33% versus 2019.  We are investing aggressively in areas with potential for future differentiation to grow our advanced diagnostics value proposition, including automatic tests, next gen sequencing, bioinformatics, the sales force and customer service. We're leveraging our scale and expertise to give patients and fighters greater access to important innovations such as liquid biopsy, and digital pathology. Advanced diagnostics is one of the fastest growing areas of our portfolio. Our strategy and investments in this area will enable us to achieve high single digit revenue growth going forward.  Now we're equally excited about the opportunities we see in our direct-to-consumer test vertical. Revenues for QuestDirect services nearly doubled to more than $70 million in 2021, driven by both the base business growing and COVID-19 testing. We expect that non-COVID consumer diagnostic market will experience double digit growth over the next several years. And we're on track to build a $250 million direct-to-consumer business by 2025. We're ramping up our investments in to business, launching a new improved digital experience later this year. And we're also investing in enhancements to the in-person customer experience at our patient service centers.  So lots of good stuff in 2022. We're building on our long term relationships with Walmart by recently launching a consumer initiated laboratory testing on walmart.com, through our solution powered by QuestDirect. And the MyQuest platform now has nearly 23 million users, up more than 3 million in the past quarter. We are very excited about our longer term growth opportunities in advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing and our increasing investments we made in 2021 to strengthen our business and accelerate growth beyond the pandemic.  These investments were made possible with the record cash and earnings we generated over the past two years. We shared part of our two point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain laser focused on improving both operation quality and efficiency which go hand in hand. Through 2021 the Invigorate program exceeded our goal of 3% productivity improvement. We made good progress last year in procurement supply savings as well as reducing unplanned denials, and improving patient collections at the time of service.  While we faced modest inflationary wage pressure in 2021, on the supply cost side, we have more than offset any increases with cost savings from our suppliers. Historically, our Invigorate productivity savings have been net of any inflationary increases. Beyond that we continue to drive additional productivity improvements with platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence.  Now turning to our sales force -- excuse me, now turning to our workforce. Quest employees are highly engaged, based on results of our quality surveys. In a challenging labor market, we are focused and are still seeing improvement and engagement in retention. Our team has done a lot to create an inspiring workplace. And we continue to do everything we can to attract, recruit and retain talent. We're entering 2022 in a strong position within the lab industry and more broadly throughout healthcare. Our base business is poised to build off the record revenues we've achieved last year and we're investing to accelerate growth. We expect to see continued demand for COVID-19 testing services, albeit at lower levels than the last two years. The delay of the 2022 PAMA cuts announced last year was a good outcome for industry and Medicare beneficiaries. However, we will continue to be hard at work in 2022, with our trade association and Members of Congress with the goal of arriving at a permanent fix to PAMA.  We remain committed to our capital employment strategy of returning the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. This morning, we raised our dividend for the 11th time since 2011. We expect to have more than $1 billion in cash available this year for M&A and share repurchases. So putting it all together, our 2022 guidance reflects strong momentum and investment in our base business, balanced with the inevitable but expected decline in COVID-19 testing revenues.  Before turning over to Mark, I'd like to recognize and thank once again, all of our employees who really have been at the frontlines of the pandemic and continue to serve the healthcare needs of patients who depend on Quest every day. Now Mark will provide more detail on our performance and our 2022 guidance. Mark?\nMark Guinan: Thanks Steve. In the fourth quarter consolidated revenues were $2.74 billion, down 8.6% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 8.5% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected low revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by continued growth in our base testing revenue. Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew approximately 6% in the fourth quarter, and was up more than 1% excluding acquisitions.  Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 1.3% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 1.1%. Compared to our fourth quarter 2019 baseline total base testing volumes increased by more than 10%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 5% versus 2019 and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year. The progress we've made in our base business throughout 2021 continued in the fourth quarter, and base testing volumes remained consistent with our prior outlook.  As many of you know COVID-19 testing volumes moderated early in the fourth quarter, following the peak of the Delta wave in September, but then surged again in early December as the Omicron variant spread across the U.S. Together with our JV partners Sonora Quest, we resulted approximately 7.9 million molecular tests. Quest alone resulted roughly 7.3 million molecular tests and nearly 730,000 Serology tests in the fourth quarter. In January, our COVID-19 molecular volumes averaged approximately 120,000 tests per day, and over 139,000 per day, including Sonora Quest, with volumes peaking in the middle of the month.  Revenue per acquisition declined 9.8% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. In the fourth quarter increases in our base revenue per acquisition were more than offset by the impact of recent PLS revenues. Modest unit price headwinds remained consistent with our expectations.  Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $536 million, or 19.5% of revenues, compared to $795 million, or 26.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis operating income in Q4 was $579 million, or 21.1% of revenues, compared to $860 million or 28.6% of revenues last year. As you may recall, updated 2021 guidance we shared in October contemplated a lower adjusted operating margin both year-over-year and versus 3Q. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue and higher COVID-19 testing costs, headcount and wage increases and ramping strategic growth investments.  It's important to note that over time, a growing portion of our COVID-19 molecular testing volumes have come from non-traditional channels, which carry additional expenses and logistics cost. Also spiking COVID-19 positivity rates across the country in December eliminated our tooling capability, which further increased COVID-19 testing costs later in the quarter. In addition, we also experienced higher than anticipated employee healthcare costs in the fourth quarter, primarily related to COVID-19.  Reported EPS was $3.12 in the quarter, compared to $4.21 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.33, compared to $4.48 last year. Cash provided by operations was $2.23 billion in 2021, versus $2.01 billion in the prior year. We completed our $1.5 billion ASR in November, and repurchased that additional 310 million in stock in the fourth quarter. This brings total share repurchases to more than $2.2 billion in 2021. And we ended the year with $872 million on the balance sheet.  Before turning to guidance, I'd like to comment on recent trends we've seen in our labor costs. As Steve noted, we've been managing through a challenging labor environment, while wage inflation including our annual merit increase is expected to be between 3% to 4% this year. The increase in our total salaries, wages and benefits is expected to be below 3% in 2022, given the reset of our annual performance compensation, and lower expected overtime. As a reminder, all of our employees are eligible for annual performance. Now turning to guidance. We are giving full year 2022 results as follows. Revenue is expected to be between $9 billion and $9.5 billion, a decline of approximately 12% to 17% versus the prior year. Base business revenues are expected to be between 8.3 and 8.5 billion, an increase of approximately 3.5% to 6%. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $700 million and $1 billion, a decline of approximately 64% to 75% reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.63 and $8.33, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.65 to $9.35.  Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.6 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our 2022 guidance. As Steve said, we're entering 2022 in a strong position. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average between 65,000 to 80,000 tests per day in Q1, representing a decline from January wells, and approximately 20,000 to 35,000 tests per day for the full year.  For COVID-19 serology volumes the guidance assumes approximately 3,000 tests per day for the full year. Our guidance does not currently anticipate another COVID wave. We will remain ready from an operational standpoint to handle any future surges. Last month, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through April. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period. While the public health emergency could continue to get renewed beyond April, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance.  The revenues generated from COVID-19 testing have afforded us an opportunity to continue to increase investment in our business. As Steve noted earlier, we continued to ramp investment in our growth pillars, particularly the advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing opportunities. We are planning to invest approximately $160 million in our growth initiatives this year, which represents an additional $90 million in investments in 2022 versus 2021.  We also continue to incur hard costs to manage your business through the pandemic, including expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address ongoing supply chain challenges and maintain adequate staffing levels. We currently forecast these expenses to be approximately $50 million in 2022.  As a reminder, we originally expected PAMA cuts of approximately $80 million in 2022. These cuts were delayed one year until 2023. Finally, we ended 2021 with approximately 124 million diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance assumes no change in our share count in 2022, and only enough share repurchases to offset our employee equity programs and to meet our commitment of the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders.  I will now turn it back to Steve. \nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks Mark. Well, the Sunrise  had another record year providing critical COVID-19 testing for our country and delivered record revenues, earnings and cash from operations. We also grew our base businesses to a record level of 19% versus the prior year. Quest is well positioned in 2022 to deliver on its commitments. I'm proud of the incredible accomplishments of our 50,000 Quest employees throughout the pandemic. And finally, our team is strong, the business has never been better, and Quest's future is bright as we begin a gradual transition to new leadership.  Thank you. Be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions at the request of the company. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back into the queue.  And the first question is coming from Jack Meehan, Nephron Research. Your line is open. \nSteve Rusckowski: Hey, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Hey, good morning. First, I know this isn't the end. But congrats Steve and Mark on the retirement and Jim, congrats on earning the big feat. Agreed, it's very well deserved for you.\nJames E. Davis : Thank you, Jack. \nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks Jack.\nMark Guinan: Thanks Jack.\nJack Meehan: So first question. There's been a lot of anxiety around pressures on the lab industry, which I personally find very interesting, because historically, that's actually been the bull case for Quest. So it would just be great to get your thoughts on what you're hearing from hospitals around outsourcing. Have you picked up any new contracts and potential for share gain versus some of these regional independent labs? \nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah, thanks, Jack, for the question. There is a lot of pressure in our industry, and particularly at hospitals. And so we are seeing continued interest and are working with hospital systems and helping them become more efficient and productive with their professional lab services business. That continues to be a big opportunity. You saw in our prepared remarks it grew nicely over the last couple of years. We have a half a billion dollar business, and therefore that moves, it moves our enterprise a significant level. So that's number one.  Number two, is we are very strong, and we continue to drive operational excellence. As you all know, this is not new, it's institutionalized in Quest. We believe we have the cadence and the capabilities to continue to offset any inflationary pressure we have. And we've done that. We did it last year, we'll continue to do that going forward. And as I said, in my introductory remarks, our array included Invigorate. We talked about inflationary pressures on our cost of sales. By the Invigorate savings is a net number. So any increases, offset by the saving always been positive for us and getting more savings than cost increases.  And so despite, some pressures that we see, because of the current times, we're offsetting that, and going forward, we do see that smaller laboratories will have a tougher time keeping up with some of these structures. And therefore, we do have an advantage. We saw the acquisition, we just did a flap jack in South Carolina; we are achieving that 2% growth from acquisitions. So therefore, we believe our strategy has positioned us nicely going forward to take advantage of the changes in front of us given this different times than we've ever seen. So Mark anything you'd like to add to that. \nMark Guinan: Yeah, I think the other thing that's evolving jack that you didn't mention, I'm sure it's on your radar is moves towards transparency in pricing, whether it's surprise billing. Now, certainly is complicated. So even for us, it's not simple, would depend which commercial insurance, depends on who your carrier is and so on. So it's not simple to tell people exactly what their cost is. However, it's absolutely an advantage for the national labs , specifically for Quest. So we're encouraged by some of this. It's kind of one of those secrets that a lot of people aren't aware how much better our value is compared to others.  So we really see that together with some of the things you mentioned as another reason that we're going to continue to pick up share and really return to those historic rates we were having before the pandemic started, with greater access and the knowledge, tools and value that we bring well beyond our price, including our real time estimation tools, including our MyQuest app, and all the other things that really enhance the patient experience. \nJack Meehan: Great, and as a follow up on the disclosures around the fourth quarter detection testing system, $7.9 million total, $7.3 resulted by Quest, $600,000, through the referral network. Can you talk about just the profitability on the tests that accrue to referral network versus those resulted by Quest? Because I think people just trying to figure out the relative margin upside versus revenue and wondering if maybe that was a factor we weren't considering.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah, so to be clear, except for referral network, we have a JV with Sonora Quest. So we wanted to make sure that people were aware that we're doing some math around referral on the testing volumes that we don't actually to record that revenue, because we have a minority ownership stake. So we get a proportionate share of the earnings from Sonora Quest, as we do with our other minority holdings, as we do with our majority holdings to equity earnings. So we just wanted to drive that transparency.  But in terms of pricing, and so on, so forth, I won't comment specifically on Sonora Quest. But it's not dissimilar, it's not a totally different profit structure than the things that we do ourselves. In Jack, during this less than 5% of our total volume is sent out to a referral lab. At this point in time, its effect on zero. So it's only during a surge, that we have to rely on external partner labs to help us.  Yes, what I did refer to Jack, and maybe that's what you were asking about was non-traditional channels. And so that's not where we're sending the work. It's actually how we're getting the specimens. So a lot of the work especially early was through traditional channels, or hospital partners, where we were going anyways, to collect specimens, and we would leverage all the Quest Logistics, in cases where we had people going to our ACE trauma centers, we're leveraging that.  In this case, we're actually getting it from other providers, CVS is the most notable one. As we do that, we have to have an incremental logistics structure with that incremental logistic runs. Then we do pay a fee. You kind of think about it kind of like phlebotomy, but all the work they do to collect the specimen, to engage the administrative costs of the patient to give them the results, and so there is a cost that maybe people weren't aware of when we're not getting that specimen to our traditional infrastructure. \nJack Meehan: Great. Thanks for clearing that up. \nSteve Rusckowski: Operator, next question?\nOperator: The next question is coming from Ann Hynes, Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. \nSteve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ann. \nAnn Hynes: Good morning. Congratulations to Steve, Mark, and Jim. \nJames E. Davis : Thank you.\nAnn Hynes: I just want to ask about margins, because obviously, the stock's down or underperforming, year to date versus some peers. And I think there's debate on the street about the margin profile for Quest ex-COVID. I know you guy's saw lot of pressure in q4, it was at worse than expected. And a follow up to that is, again you just got to 2022. People are really focused on what your margin profile will be in 2023. In your prepared remarks, Mark, you did talk about growth initiatives that are in 2020 to $160 million, and I think you said $50 million for incremental costs.  But I guess like, there's so many moving parts with extra labor costs, extra supply cost, you have these growth investments. I guess with -- if we look out to 2023, not giving guidance, like what do you think is repeatable and what is not? Maybe you can just comment on just the health of how you view your base margins, and the base business, that'd be great.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah, so thanks for the question, Ann. It's important one. So first off, we're not deviating from our long term outlook. So we've shared a long term outlook in March of 2021. And while the CAGRs are going to change, because we're going to have a stronger year in 2022, and the carriers I quoted that that time, were putting 2022 forward, the absolute numbers we're not deviating from because they're largely the base fitness. So we still assume that COVID will materially decline, you know, time will tell. At that point, it's really all-round our base business.  So when people are looking at the current profitability of the base business, and I can understand how this happens. One of the flaws of that is that there really -- you can't really do the two in isolation. So let me give some examples. Because we've had such a surprisingly strong year, this year relative to what we expected, driven by COVID, we're paying a significantly higher incentive performance bonus. And that's across the whole employee base. And, right now, that would not be expected to be repeated next year.  So that, quote, inflated our costs. And so to assign all of that cost against the base business, which is what implicitly it's done, when you do COVID revenue times a certain margin drop through, and then you assume back against the base business, that is not accurate. The other thing is, we have significant incremental costs related to the pandemic, which I mentioned in the prepared remarks, around $50 million of cost. If COVID really goes away, we would expect those costs will largely go away. And those costs are really be assigned to COVID, not to the base business.  We had quite a bit of overtime later in the year. And that was related to employee absences driven by the COVID surge, and we spent about $25 million more in 2021, then we historically spend in over time. And we would expect that would go away, as well, as COVID starts to step back. And so again, that that s implicitly put against the big business, when you do the high level math that I've seen a lot of people do. And so the way to think about the base business is obviously from our guidance, we are hundreds of millions of dollars above where we were in 2019.  We expect to be back to the growth that we were experiencing pre-pandemic. I know, it seems like a long time. But if you look at the first two months, and we mentioned this several times of 2020, before the pandemic started, even after a full year of the network access teams we have in 2019, we're still growing mid-single digits. We're going to get back to that growth, okay, in the base business. And the profitability of the base business is going to be similar to what it was before 2019.  So hopefully, that puts all the pieces together for you. Obviously, there's anything I can clarify, I'd be happy to take a follow up. \nAnn Hynes: No, that's very helpful. And just as a follow up, just to your growth initiatives, like the $9 million incremental in 2022. How should we view that for 2023? \nSteve Rusckowski: Right, so some of those will ramp down, because there are discrete investments to get us where we need to get to. So for instance, a big piece of that is building what we need for our consumer is fantastic. And to move from where we were to a more Amazon like, not that we'll get completely there, but experience for patients who want to find tests and order it, pay their bill, et cetera is expensive. It takes a lot of work with marketing analytics to do the appropriate marketing and understanding of customer preferences, and respond to customers in appropriate way. A lot of IT investment in the near term to get us to that future state.  Now as we're growing that business to a $0.25 billion, which is what we said we would get to by 2025, there are going to be some ongoing costs, because we're adding people to support that business. It isn't a grown up business. And there are going to be some variable costs with that. However, as we grow those businesses, we're going to grow fast. And so some of those ongoing costs are going to get paid for that faster growth. And then I would say similarly, advanced diagnostics, as we accelerate that growth, some of the resources we're adding today that we're calling out pre that growth are going to be in the run rate and profitability going forward.  So the costs don't go away completely, but they will ramp down because some of this is kind of startup expenses. And then that revenue, obviously in the end, the margin is going to pay for those incremental costs over the next several years.  Only it's after that . Remember, when we talked about this year, these investments really started in the back half of 2020. And we talked about an exceptional year in 2020. We talked about an exceptional year in 2021. And therefore we took advantage of the opportunity invested in accelerated growth entirely consistent with what we share with you as our growth portfolio portfolio. And what you're seeing in our results, our ranges, the benefits of those investments, you're seeing great growth in our focus areas of advanced diagnostics. I highlighted those areas of our portfolio that we focus on.  And these are not insignificant portions of our portfolio. I share my  several 100 millions of dollars of focus for us that are growing strong double digits versus last year versus 2019. And then secondly, is our consumer initiative testing business has grown considerably. We talked about $70 billion, almost half to 250 . And so therefore, we're already starting to see the benefits. So as with any of that we certainly expect a business return. We're getting some evidences of return already. '21 looks like more of it than '22. And so when we get into '23, you got to track that.  They were not served in the beginning. What we're putting on right time is exactly what we laid out on Investor Day. That is, we have a baseline coming out of '22 that we believe in, and what we just shared in our '22 guidance is entirely consistent with that. And we will continue to grow our earnings. The high growth, we highlighted 7% to 9%, and that will continue through '23 and '24. So we feel what we've done so far, and what we delivered is entirely consistent with what we believe the prospects of -- we do believe the opportunity in front of us are even more attractive than before, because we found the proceeds, was relative to accelerate the program was real. \nMark Guinan: Yeah, just one point of clarification. So the 7% to 9% was when we thought we could do $7.40 $8 in 2022. And we said we'd be at the upper end of that. So you can pick your number between $7.40 and $8, carry forward $7 to $8, through '23 and '24. And that dollar level of EPS is what we're saying we can still do. Obviously, since 2022, is turning out based on our guidance, a lot higher than we said in March, the CAGR is going to be lower. But the absolute numbers we're still committed to at this point. \nSteve Rusckowski: Operator, we're going to go to the next question. I just want to let everyone know, we won't go past the bottom of the hour. We have a lot of folks in queue. We want to get to all your questions. Operator? \nOperator: And the next question is going to be from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. \nSteve Rusckowski: Hey, A.J.\nMark Guinan: Good morning, A.J.\nA.J. Rice: Hello, everybody. Best wishes on the transition to all. And maybe just to ask M&A pipeline. A, any update on what you're seeing out there, what the opportunity set looks like? B, does the management transition cause you in any way to pull back or to pivot in a different direction in organic growth prospects? And then just maybe finally on the Pack Health deal? That was obviously not a huge deal, but an interesting one. Does that suggest a pivot, and what's sort of the opportunity there with that acquisition? \nSteve Rusckowski: A.J., thanks. We continue to believe that we can continue to deliver that 2% growth off our base business going forward. We've delivered that in the past, and we have every reason to believe that we will continue going forward. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see hospitals looking at what we've done with other hospitals, and opportunity for them to rely on us as the testing and that product continues to build. And we continue to look at some outreach purchases with hospitals.  And then, as I mentioned, Labtech was a good example of a regional laboratory and a good piece of the United States that we picked up as well. And we continue to look at acquisitions that build on our portfolio. Remember, we have this lens of focusing on general diagnostics. Jim Davis, runs that business, in addition to that advanced diagnostics. But the third pieces are those services that take the information that we generate, and we provide services, and we do this employer population health. And we built on that business to work with health plans, on helping them manage the risk with the data and providing services that help them do that.  So Pack Health fits into that direction for the company. And we've done some other acquisitions that help us with that direction as well. And you're going to hear more about -- we will continue to invest in that space going forward. And also in your question, does the management change slow us down in any way and here what we might do an acquisition, I would say to the contrary, you know, Jim's been part of the management team for over eight years. He's highly engaged in all acquisitions. He's been instrumental in executing all of our acquisitions. And all the businesses that he participated in are always part of the funnel building that we have.  So Jim any remarks about the 40 acquisitions we've done, and your team to find more opportunities. \nJames E. Davis : No, A.J., as Steve said, I've been part of all 40 of those acquisitions. And it's not going to slow down. We're not going to do -- we're going to do smart deals. We're going to be selective, but we're going to continue to build our base business. We're going to continue to find niche applications to build out our events diagnostics portfolio, and we're going to continue to focus on hospital outreach deals, those that are willing to get out of business. We're right there ready to help out. \nA.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks so much. \nSteve Rusckowski: Hey, A.J. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open. \nSteve Rusckowski: Hey, Patrick.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey. Two questions. Maybe just one on some recent payer negotiations. Obviously, you guys have talked a lot about inflationary pressures and supply chain things. How much does that come up in kind of the negotiations with payers? Are you able to pass that along? I know you guys are in a pretty good place, with payers relative to historic levels. So maybe just talk through some of those conversations and ability to pass price along and price increases in those payer contracts.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. Thanks Patrick. Well, so there's a lot of attention these days on inflationary pressures. And we think we've handled those questions. We think it's all very manageable for us, in terms of our operational excellence programs, and finding the productivity, we need to offset it. So that's one piece of the equation. The other piece is what you're bringing up, is around pricing. And we feel good about what we delivered in that regard.  Matter of fact, if you look at the results for '21, what you find is that their unit price changes, and this is freezing everything from volume in meds, and just looking at unit price changes is below that 100 basis points that we typically are guiding you to dial into expectations going forward. And that's not just for our commercial insurance contract. It's all our businesses, our hospital business, it's our client business, independent of what whose clients might be, physicians or some other organization we work with.  So we continue to make progress on that. And we're particularly encouraged by the discussions we're having with our plans. We've shared in the past that actually, in the past, several negotiations, we've actually introduced price increases. And it is actually helping us that in fact, there is inflationary pressure across all of healthcare. So therefore, we're not alone, since we're a labor based business to pass along some of those costs to them.  So we're making good progress. And I say that the other piece of this, Patrick is, we continue to deliver great value. Our quality gets better, our service gets better. And we do that in a very competitive price already. And many of these plans believe that's in the best interest of them and their membership of growing share, is to make sure they rely on a handful of top flight laboratories, in the case of United Healthcare, they call that for labs network. And we had applied to that. And we had to demonstrate with evidence that, in fact, we have great quality. We have great service, and we're doing at very competitive prices.  So that trend will continue. When you talk about that, we're going to eventually keep on pushing us to deliver more and more value, which helps you in terms of managing your network. We, in many cases are going to start looking at some price increases going forward. So good progress there. Thanks for asking the question. Mark, anything you want to add? \nMark Guinan: Yeah, I just want to remind people of what we talked about, over our tenure. We have this Invigorate program, drives about 3% productivity. We call it productivity, because some of it is top line enhancing. It's not all around costs. And we've mentioned the fact that we have these pay fors . And one of them has been priced stretched. One of them has been annual labor inflation. And then we talked about the fact that as we got priced in a better place that actually was helping with margin expansion.  So we have enough productivity to do more than the pay fors. So now we look at where we are today, and as Steve mentioned, a much better position. I can't specifically say it's related to inflation. But I can assure you that that is part of the conversation in addition to PAMA, and the value that we bring in, so and so. We've really moved the conversation dramatically from when we started here, to more about value. And fortunately for us, I can share that in the last three national payer contracts, all three of them, we got an increase. That was modest. But you compare that to where we've been historically, great news.  And that also means that even if we have a little more inflation, and I think we talked about this quite a bit, we've got plenty of Invigorate. And that Invigorate now, doesn't need to cover as much of the price erosion that we have historically. And that price erosion that Steve shared is really heavily in the clientele. And as we've talked over the last number of earnings calls that comes from the hospital clients who are under tremendous pressure, and we shared the reasons for that. And also in some states where physicians can do clientele markup, we have that pressure as well.  And really with the commercial payers, we're in a really good place on prices lately. \nPatrick Donnelly: That's really helpful. I appreciate it. And then just a quick follow up on COVID. Maybe pricing and volume, you mentioned no expectation for the PHE to continue to be extended in the second half or at least is not baked in, sorry. How do you think about the pricing piece both commercial? Will they follow -- kind of wait for the PHE? And then the volume side, you are expecting it to be endemic. A lot of the diagnostic players have obviously talked about multiple years of COVID revenues going out. Just curious on your take there. Thank you. \nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. So what we're assuming in our values is getting some ranges of what we think COVID testing will be. Obviously, it's going to start higher in the first quarter, it's going to go down, as we're hopeful that this current surge will decline throughout the spring and into the summer. And as you mentioned, we did get the 90 day extension. And then we're not planning in the guidance that that will be extended, but we just don't know. So therefore, we're always assuming the worst case. And that if that were to come down, yes, we do believe there will be some price changes, if you will, with some of our partners.  But again, what we've implied in the guidance is kind of volumes and some decline in pricing. And also the assumption that we're not going to get a renewal of the emergency order. But again, we don't know that. So Mark anything you'd like to add? \nMark Guinan: Yeah, just to remind you -- not that I need to remind you all that, the rates that CMS determined at $51. And so while we don't assume post PHE that everything falls immediately there, there's a pretty steep ramp down. And then so for the volume that is in our guidance beyond the PHE in late April, we're assuming a significantly lower reimbursement than we've experienced to-date and that we're expecting to get till late April. \nSteve Rusckowski: Next question? \nOperator: The next question is coming from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Good morning, and best wishes to all of you. Jim you are going to be my fourth Quest CEO I'll be working with. So very excited. \nJames E. Davis : Thank you.\nRicky Goldwasser: Dating all the way back to Ken Freeman's days. So I just wanted to go back to sort of what the 2022 baseline is. Since this has got like really the bulk of the questions we're getting from investors sort of how should we think about the 2022 normalized baselines that we can build off for 2023? I know that you kind of said in response to one of the questions that in terms of absolute EPS, you are where you expected to be last year. But if maybe you can give us the range, right? We're getting to somewhere between kind of like $7.60 to $7.80 is a normalized based on for $4.2 as a starting point.  Just wanted to kind of like see if we're in the ballpark. And then off that maybe just qualitatively what are the headwinds and tailwinds that we should think about as we think about modeling out to 2023. \nSteve Rusckowski: Go ahead Mark.\nMark Guinan: Yeah, so. I'm sure you understand Ricky, even if I was willing, I can't really give you an EPS number on the face. So I think the best thing I could do is, point you to pre-pandemic, revenue and earnings and tell you that if you look at the growth in the base business based on what we're giving in guidance, the profitability is not dissimilar. So you can kind of directionally place where that business might be. And the reason I can't really give is back to what I talked about earlier.  So where do I assign the $50 million of pandemic expense? Arguably, if we didn't have COVID testing, we would still have that cost. And you'd say, okay, let's go about your base business. But the truth is that we also have the COVID testing in revenue. So again COVID revenue is going to go into the base business. And then importantly, when you talk about headwinds and tailwinds, we would expect that cost to go away and should be temporary, because it is specifically tied to CDC guidelines and other things.  We talked about some of the others, you know, some things including there, like supply disruptions. I don't know how long that's going to last. And we all know, it's not just in our business. It's across all aspects of life today, and it's modeled to go away in 12 months, not sure. That's certainly something we want to absolutely make sure that we have what we need. And so we are paying premium costs right now, relative to what we did pre pandemics in insurance, get to our patient service centers, our laboratories have everything they need. And that's really kind of our insurance, which fortunately, we can afford to do right now. Because we also do have that COVID revenue and COVID margin.  So really, I think that's the best color I could give you which is the base business is in good shape. We activate Q4 organically back to where we were in 2019. We've done significant M&A over the last couple of years, we've built the PLS business. So beyond the organic clinical business, we're hundreds of millions of dollars higher. And while the profitability and all that may not be precisely the same directionally people could feel confident that the profitability has moved at least to that growth .\nSteve Rusckowski: So to remind you, our base business in '21 was larger than what we had in 2019. So it has grown. So it has recovered. And we're going to grow on top of that. And that's implied in our guidance for base business. And we intentionally broke out basis from COVID assumptions for '22. So you can kind of dissect who or what's going on with that business. And I keep on reminding you of investments that we're making are part of our base business. And we started those investments in '21. They continue in '22, and therefore, that's going to help us accelerate growth.  And as Mark said, we feel very confident about the profitability of our base systems. And by the way, when I said in my introductory remarks, is we do not believe COVID is going to entirely go away. It's going to be part -- a permanent part of our portfolio. So you should assume there's some COVID testing in '23 as well. We will continue to still play a role with our PCR testing. And we believe there's a growing role for serology particularly related to our ability to be able to provide some insight around the protection that individuals have in their bodies. And we're going to have more on that to come.  But you put it together is -- and we believe the prospects for '23 and beyond are quite bright. So thank you. \nJames E. Davis : Ricky, I would add one other thing. And that's as probably Mark stated at the pace business has recovered in 2019 levels are still not going to interject in terms of a headwind. There's still pent up demand for routine clinical care. If you look at the studies around HIV infection rates, hepatitis C infection rates, the data still indicates that there was a lack of routine clinical care during the pandemic. And we do think that should provide some headwinds going into the later part of this year and next year. \nSteve Rusckowski: Operator, next question. \nOperator: And the next question is coming from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open. \nBrian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning, guys. And congratulations all around. I guess I'll follow up to that last answer that you gave. Yeah. So as we think about COVID becoming more endemic, rather than what it is today, is it probably more correct to think of this opportunity or this part of your business as something like say, the flu -- the flu test where some of it's -- or most of its point of care, and then a big -- a small chunk of it sent over to you guys? And then how should we be thinking about the economics if that was the case? \nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. Well, let me start, and then my colleagues will round it out, I'm sure. So this isn't going away anytime soon. I think obviously, that we're going to have COVID in '23. And we're going to provide testing around that. And as you know, because you're living with it everyday, like the rest of us, when somebody has some symptoms, you're ruling out COVID. In many cases, that is a PCR test, and that will continue. So therefore, you don't think about just being flu, but it's any type of respiratory illness, and it could be a common cold or another respiratory illness. So there'll be continuation of that, going forward.  And also, we keep on highlighting the value of serology. There is going to be increased role for us to provide insight on how much protection people have from vaccines or from natural immunity. And as we know, that's changing over time. And people want to have that insight to, manage the risk and work with their physician on that. So we think there, there's going to be increased value in that. So we do believe, in '23, this is going to be a permanent part of our portfolio.  It's hard right now to scale that and we'll learn more as we get into '22. But when we think about it, we actually think of this as an additional portion of a product line that we didn't have before the pandemic. So we actually decided that it was helpful to, achieve the value we think we have. And then as Jim said, base business continues to be in really strong shape. We crossed the growth of '19 sooner in '21, we're entering '22 in . Our growth prospects, there continue to be ones that we continue to work. So that should continue to be a good opportunity for ourselves.  So we're filling our chips together well, and COVID is going to products provide more fuel for us to make these investments in our base business that help us and 23. So we Yes, we're focused on what the costs are, but we only make these investments if in fact, we expect to get the returns and you'll see those returns, both in '22. But also in '23 and beyond. So Mark anything you'd like to that? \nMark Guinan: Yeah, thanks. Brian, it's a great question. And we can't predict with any certainty what's going to happen. I think the two unknowns are, how comfortable will physicians be with taking the specimen sample themselves in the office going forward? And maybe they'll be very comfortable like that with the flu where maybe they'll be like, no, I'd rather I'd rather not handle that. I'd rather not do that point of care test and all the risks that come with that. I'll just send it to a lab. But then the other one, really importantly, the economics. So the payers are going to have a lot of influence on whether this is done.  Now yes, point of care testing, arguably, some people do it for faster turnaround times. But a lot of it is done because they make money off of it. So depending on what the payers decide around point of care reimbursement that will have a large influence on how much of this work comes to us and how much that of it stays in the office. Then let me just stop and ask Jim to comment on this. \nSteve Rusckowski: If you look at our volumes are impressive. We've had a challenge this year, because of the infection rate, and therefore our ability not to be able to fail to deliver on cooling , which is more capacity and lower costs. But that will come back with infection rate, which dropped. But as we go forward with this, we start to see this becoming more of an epidemic and less of a pandemic, then there's a lot of players in this marketplace, and Jim and his team are entirely focused on what we have for sure today, and what we could do going forward to gain some share going forward.  So when you think about the opportunity around COVID, if you look at that market, you think about Quest Diagnostics, you think about the dynamics of the short run, where there's been some opportunistic players. We're not optimistic. This is going to be part of a permanent part of our portfolio. And therefore we also are pushing hard, and making sure that we get what we believe what you have to share in the short term. But also in the long term, we think there might be an opportunity as well to pick up some share. Jim, you'd like to add to that.\nJames E. Davis : Yeah, what we did find during this last surge is we had a series of 10 default partners that we've referred work out to, when we couldn't handle the volume, especially during peak days during the work. And at least 50% of those partners had gotten out of business and decided they just didn't want to rebrand for capacity. So while there may be the physical capacity out there, some of that physical capacity, especially on the PCR side has returned to the clinical kinds of work that those firms were doing, other molecular work.  So that is, I think advantages us in the future, if there is another surge here. \nSteve Rusckowski: Operator, next question. \nOperator: And the next question is coming from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nPito Chickering: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve and Mark it's been a pleasure working with you over the years. And congrats to you, Jim, on this promotion. A lot of questions thrown around the space business. So let me ask this a different way. I believe you general guide from an $8.50 EPS range for 2023 was from limited COVID earnings. Can you talk about EBIT margins in 2023 versus the 17% range seen in 2019 without COVID? So I believe are within that guidance range are implying essentially flat margins, with Invigorate offsetting inflationary pressures? Is that just the right takeaway, that we should be leaving today's call with? \nMark Guinan: Yeah, so we intentionally don't really target or comment on margins, because we believe value creation can come at different levels of margin. Then we talked about specifically on PLS, where it's great growth, great return on invested capital. And those are the two biggest correlators to shareholder value creation. But they come at a lower margin. So we don't worry about margin Pito per se, but I understand others do. And so to answer your question, there's a pretty broad range, you know, obviously, one year less than over multiple years when you put a CAGR with a couple 100 basis points differential on the top line and bottom line.  So there's a lot of different combinations. So what I would say is, your EPS number that you mentioned, is not unreasonable. And you can figure out the revenue based on what we said, at Investor Day, and then what we're guiding to this year in terms of the base business, and yeah, at this point, we're not counting on COVID to be significantly larger than maybe a flu business or something like that. But certainly, we don't know. And there's a chance that it could be larger than that. And that will be determined over the next 12 months or so.  So that's about strongest color I can give you right now, is back to what we said. If you're really good about our base business going forward, we're going to adapt to that growth level. And I want to remind everybody that when we grow organically, the drop down is much higher than that 17% or, the 19.5% that we delivered in Q4, and so on. It drops down at a level, you know, 50% or more depending if it's an existing customer, where we're expanding the menu, or it's a new customer, where we do have to invest a little maybe in logistics and in IT for the interfaces.  But growth brings with it margin expansion, in addition to Invigorate. That's why we're confident we can grow earnings faster than top line, from that period forward. \nPito Chickering: Okay, so just if I ask the question just a different way, not on the margin side. Let me -- I just sort of think about 2023 EBIT versus 2019 sort of a cleaner non-COVID numbers, we should be modeling to sort of a low teens EBIT, increase in '23 relative to 2019. \nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah, I mean, you can -- yeah, I mean, you can do the math. Yes. I mean\u2026 \nMark Guinan:  about earnings per share. \nSteve Rusckowski: Okay, good. So what we -- Mark just said what we said is, we've always provided our outlook and guidance for our mix  per share, because we do have a mix of business, we do have some lower margin business, that might be a good value creating opportunity for us, we're going to go after it like a PLS business. So our guidance for EPS would be expansion of EPS over time, rebasing it, if you will, for these changes that we've seen for the last two years. And Mark has reiterated our belief that our base business will fuel good opportunities for us to continue to deliver against that.  By the way, as we continue to gain share, variable gross margin is quite good. And as I said, we also believe there's going to be some COVID in '23. And it's hard to size it right now, but it's not going to go away soon.\nMark Guinan: Yeah. And then the other thing is that, I'm not in any position to provide guidance in 2023. So that's why we're focusing every one of the things there. However, when you think about what can happen, COVID can be larger. We don't know, we're not counting at this point. And then we did mention we've got a -- we expect a billion dollars of cash this year. So between opportunity to quite a bit of M&A, and we'll see, or do share repurchases, those also aren't specifically contemplated.  So that's why like locking down to a specific number is really difficult and probably not productive. So I would point you to what we said at investor day, and kind of assuming that that's reasonable if these things don't play out significantly differently from our current view of what 2043 might bring. \nPito Chickering: Great, thanks so much guys. \nSteve Rusckowski: Operator, next question. \nOperator: And the next question is coming from Matt Larew of William Blair. Your line is open. \nMatt Larew: Hi, good morning. The 3% Invigorate target has been aided in recent years as you've consolidated volume onto your two new labs and consolidated into one amino acid platform. I'm curious, what are the keys going forward here to keep driving those gains? And then maybe the second piece on cost would be separate from some of the extra costs you've called out today related to COVID, clearly, you've built up some infrastructure, both personnel and instrumentation for COVID.  I'm just curious how much of that you think goes away as COVID moves to an endemic perhaps you need less extra capacity? \nSteve Rusckowski: Great, thanks for the question. I'll weigh in and turn to Jim to add to the answer. We've been working on operational excellence for over a decade, and it has become institutionalized in our company culture, and embedded in how we do things. And it is, is a platform for how we're going to continue to grow. So your comment was around costs. We don't talk about cost, we talked about productivity, because there's a lot of aspects of what we do around Invigorate and some actually helps the top line, some actually helps getting more output with less labor. And yes, some helps us to become more efficient by less input from some of the materials that we use.  So we looked at an aggregate, and we continue to be bullish on our prospects. We believe that it is the ingredients for us to continue to deliver great value. That is when we do this we improve our quality, or service gets better. And oh, by the way, we become more and more productive to be able to make investments to fuel the growth. So it all fits together. And when we talk about this, and we talked about at Investor Day. We see an enormous opportunity for us to continue to digitize and innovate in operational excellence.  And so some of you have had the opportunity to tour through our latest lab of the future and that's our new facilities -- facility in Clifton, New Jersey. Sometimes if you come in, you'll see what we've done and take some of the learnings out of our Marlborough facility up in the Boston area. We brought that down to Clifton and we built on it. And that also gives us advantages of some consolidation with some of our new platforms. But Jim and the team are now taking that, and thinking about okay, what's next?  Okay, so we think about innovation in our space, yes, there's innovation in terms of testing, and as far as diagnostic information services. But we equally think there's a lot of innovation and opportunity for us to move forward. So we continue to invest. And we talk about investments, we talk about the use of cash. As you notice, we've been putting about $40 million a year into our capital budget, which is investments and frankly, a lot of our innovation that allow us to fuel this productivity game. So Jim?\nJames E. Davis : Yeah, I think Steve has touched on three key themes, automation, use of artificial intelligence, and the continued digitization of so many products. So Marlborough and Clifton are terrific examples of that. But as you know, they're all brand new laboratories. We've got 20 plus other laboratories in our network. And there's opportunities in every one of those laboratories without building new Greenfield sites to continue that automation journey. In particular, in our processing area, and what we call our fluid handling system, handling of blood and urine.  On the artificial intelligence side, you're going to see us move in pathology, psychology, microbiology, we've got some great examples of each of those departments today. We're deploying artificial intelligence systems that help with the readout of those images. And then Steve mentioned just the continued digitization. Now beyond the immunoassay platform where we consolidated around the , there are still other opportunities like that in our laboratories.  We recently ran a competition in your analysis, so likely to new vendors is next for that platform. And are rolling out those two platforms across all 23 Plus laboratories, it's going to generate a lot of productivity year over year. So as long as we have healthy third party vendors that continue to innovate, those innovations will come to our labs. And we'll continue along that 3% productivity journey. \nSteve Rusckowski: So we're bullish on the prospects of continuing to drive productivity. I always react to this as a cost cutting goal. And this is not all about cost cutting goal. This is about working smarter. And this has been a key part of our strategy. And it fuels growth. And Jim mentioned some of the areas. I picture my internship  also digital pathology, which revolutionized our ability to diagnose and treat and to do that more productively. And this week, Jim is going up another laboratory to take a look at where we're going to make our next investment this year.  So we're going to invest in the space. And we have a lot more opportunity in front of us. So it's exciting. \nJames E. Davis : Yeah, I just want to add that, remember, this is not just in the lab. So there's a lot of productivity that's driven outside. And specifically, I'll give two examples, logistics. So we really have an incredible ability to be efficient with logistics, and continue to improve. So we have some cases where we have empty pickups, where we have some customers that don't give us specimens all the time. It's periodic. Now we have the ability and technology to not do that empty pickup. So that's an efficiency. We also get requests for what we call staff pickups, where somebody needs something quick turnaround, et cetera. And so the ability to most efficiently get one of our vehicles there has been enhanced through our technology.  The other one is in our patient draw centers. We really can increasingly move the administrative burdens off the phlebotomist, allow them to do phlebotomy by getting people to go to our website, put in their insurance information, everything. And so the phlebotomist spends a couple less minutes with each patient doing administrative doing phlebotomy. We drive up the productivity in our draw centers.  So those are just a couple examples of productivity gains that aren't really cost reductions, but enhance our ability to do more with the same resources and drive up our quality and everything else outside the laboratory. \nSteve Rusckowski: Operator next question please. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys, this is Kapian  for Tycho. Congratulations to all. Can you maybe talk towards the percentage of COVID testing that was consumer initiated you know whether it's through MyQuest direct or other non-traditional avenues and how do you see that trending in 2022? You mentioned that there are different costs associated with non-traditional avenues of testing. So maybe can you quantify the difference margin profiles between traditional and non-traditional? \nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah, so what I can share is, go back to what we said in the prepared remarks, our consumer business was about $70 million last year, between the base and COVID, we did $2.7 million of COVID revenue. So the consumer initiated COVID testing was very small, at this point, and, it's strengthening. And again, as I said, we continue to enhance our website, when people go for that ordering, and testing and so on. But there's still more to come in terms of enhancing that experience for consumers and driving awareness for people. As you know, we're competing with a lot of people who see these stand up operations in parking lots, and so on and so forth, which draw their attention.  So we're working on making sure that they know we can do this and initiate themselves as opposed to going to a doctor or hospital for this. And we expect to get stronger and stronger moving forward as we enhance our overall consumer business through these investments we just mentioned.  In terms of the margin profile, it's really not -- it's not all that different between the consumer and consumer can add in different ways. They can come to our patient draw center and have it done there. We do have home collection kits where they can be sent to their home. So a little different structure, but not materially different in profitability.  Operator next question. \nOperator: And the next question is coming from Derrick Brown with Bank of America. Your line is open. \nDerik de Bruin: Hey, great, thank you for squeezing me in. I'll just make this quick. Can we talk a little bit about, sort of like the real -- PAMA outlook? So you would assume $80 million that again comes back in '23? I mean what are the chances that this actually does get resolved, and that the lobbying efforts pay off and gives the current administration a little bit more or Congress a little bit more willingness to listen to this, and sort of do it? I mean, there's a chance that it gets -- that there's actually some reversion, just given what happened. Thanks. \nMark Guinan: Yeah. Before Steve addresses that I just want to remind everybody that that $80 million was built into our long term outlook. We just assumed it would happen this year. So again, although it would be a year on year get to us, you know, incrementally in comparison, in the long term outlets, it was assumed that we would get that in 2022. So it's already built that. \nSteve Rusckowski: So thanks for the question. And as we said, we were thankful that it was delayed, again, the one year offset, as Mark indicated to 23. We think that's good for us, because it will gave us some time this year, to keep on working on a permanent fix with Congress. And we have been very active working with Congress last year. And as you know, Congress was very busy with the Infrastructure Bill, and other business and therefore we're fortunate enough to get in the postponed it, but it allows us time this year to keep on working on this to get a permanent fix.  We're encouraged by the level of support, brought up the importance of testing and the importance of having a strong industry. We're getting strong, bipartisan support, both from the House and from the Senate. We made a proposal of what we think should be changed to improve the data collection process, the sampling of market based data. We continue to support the notion and the philosophy of PAMA that is we should be paid a commercial rate. But we believe that CMS has it wrong .  And in parallel with the Congress, we continue to have our lawsuit against CMS and the trade association. The judge has heard the arguments we'll see if we get some indication on a decision on that. Hard to call that, but that's still in the works as well. So our work right now this year is to push for permanent fix to PAMA. And we're better positioned now because the pandemic than before the pandemic because of the strength of this industry here in global awareness and appreciation of what we've done and the need for strong laboratory industry going forward. \nSteve Rusckowski: Operator last question please.\nOperator: And our last question is coming from Eric Caldwell of Baird. Your line is open. \nEric Coldwell: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Masterful job clearing up some of the overriding concerns on core markets today. So thank you. When you went through your list of things that don't repeat or go down significantly as COVID incremental cost overtime staffing challenges, et cetera go away. You mentioned bonuses. And I think it was the one number in the list of call outs that I didn't hear you quantify. I'm curious if we could get the incremental bonus, due to the COVID, upside profitability in '21. How you think that bonus will normalize, whether it's '22 or '23?  And then my follow-up, I'll just stow it in here. I was hoping we could get average way to reimbursement in the fourth quarter. I know you said it would be relatively similar through the PHE. But if you could give us a little more specificity on where AWR came out, in 4Q on COVID PCR testing, that would be helpful. Thanks. \nSteve Rusckowski: Sure, so let me start with that one. Because I think there was some questions around maybe with their turnaround time suffered, and we didn't get the $25 fee that comes with some of the government payers couple the current pairs. And actually, not really, AWR in Q4 was absolutely similar to what has been in the previous quarters. And our turnaround time performance was outstanding. We did in January when the surge came, we did a little bit, we did have a little bit of a hit to our turnaround time. But obviously, that's all contemplated in the guidance that we just provided and it wasn't a huge amount.  When you -- back to the early question, bonuses, and the bonuses, when we look at the bonuses, you know, most of it is really our 50,000 employees. So people think about bonuses, must be senior management. Most of the cost is really, we pay 3% bonus to even our wage workers. And then obviously, we have other staff members that you know, at higher targets. And every year we budget for what we call, one x whatever that target is. So for most of the people do 3%. And based on performance, and we feel we've had reasonable stretch performances, when we had historically, we have not paid significantly above 1x. And we've had a number of years where it's below 1x.  But the COVID, unpredictability and the surge in revenues, enabled us to pay our employees significant bonuses, in 2020. And again, in 2021. And so if you look at, without getting too specific, and we've shared a number in the past, a $3 billion wage bill, that's gone up in the last couple of years as we've grown the company. So you can kind of as a floor, say 3%, obviously a little higher, because if people want a higher bonus, that's about 1x. And then, we're paying a bonus that's substantially higher than that, in 2021, like we did in 2020.  The other thing is, we did pay out a $500 payment to the majority of our employees to compensate them for COVID expenses. In 2020, we adjusted it out of our adjusted earnings, because we were seeing COVID as temporal and extraordinary. But once you get to your second time doing it, even though I still think it's extraordinary, we just decided not to adjust it out. So we did have over a $20 million payment, late in the year, $500 to our wage employee and some of our lower compensated professionals as well.  So those are a couple of things that would go away and not be repeated like somehow, we had another surprising COVID year in 2022 like we had in 2021 \nEric Coldwell: That's a great response. I'm not sure I'm smart enough to do 1x 3% plus and insignificant increases there. Any chance you could frame that as incremental $50 million, incremental $100 million just directionally can we get a little closer? \nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah, let's say it's less than $100 million, but substantially more than $50 million. \nEric Coldwell: Okay, that's about what I thought. Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Congrats to everyone. \nSteve Rusckowski: Thank you. Very good. Well, thanks, it's been a great session with you all. Thanks for all the great questions. And again, thanks for joining the call today and we appreciate your support. You guys have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter and full year 2021 conference call.

            "name": "Steve Rusckowski",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn and thanks everyone for joining us today. Over the past two years, our 50,000 quest employees have risen to the challenge of COVID-19, innovating, persevering, and remaining committed to the patients and customers we serve. While doing so, they also grew our base business by more than 19% in 2021, achieving record levels. I'm extremely proud of what we have accomplished as a team. So we have a lot of news to cover this morning. And I want to get into that so we can have your questions. So let's get started.  So first, I'll start by sharing some color on the leadership transition we've announced this morning. Then we'll review our performance for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2021. And then finally Mark will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial outlook for 2022.  So as you have seen, in our announcement this morning, we've begun implementing a gradual leadership succession plan, under which Jim Davis, Executive Vice President of General Diagnostics will succeed me to become Chief Executive Officer on November 1, 2022. At that time, I will continue to serve on the Quest Board of Directors as Executive Chairman.  Quest Diagnostics is a great company that is well-positioned to continue to deliver shareholder value. As I approached a decade in the role, the Board and I determined that now is the right time to begin to turn over the helm to a new leader. Jim Davis is extremely well qualified to be CEO, having managed a large part of this company in his role as Executive Vice President. He has deep knowledge of Quest, the healthcare industry and the corporate world, gained through more than 35 years of business experience. Jim is widely respected and will be a strong CEO. When I took this role nearly 10 years ago, Quest was not growing, nor realizing its potential. We launched a new strategy, our new Quest to drive transformational change. To drive that change, we built a new leadership team, and Jim has been a key member of that team. We built a business strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. To drive growth, we focused on improving relationships with health plans, hospital health systems, and expanding fast growing businesses, and advanced diagnostics, and consumer testing.  In addition, we've added about 2% revenue growth on average through accretive, strategically aligned acquisitions over the last several years. We have driven operational excellence, and our Invigorate program has consistently improved quality and customer experience, while generating 3% productivity each year. And we've made more inclusive by increasing the diversity on our Board, and amongst our management ranks.  Finally, we established Quest for Health Equity in 2020, over $100 million committed to reduce healthcare disparities among underserved in the United States, particularly communities of color. I am very proud of what we've accomplished together. And if you consider the opportunities in front of us, in many ways, we're just getting started.  We have a strong team and Jim as a key leader in our transformation. He runs our General Diagnostics business, which accounts for more than 80% of revenues and three quarters of our employees. He manages operations, including sales and marketing, patient services, logistics, laboratories, billing and customer services. He also oversees the Drive Operational Excellence strategy, which includes our Invigorate program. He has provided enterprise oversight for pandemic response. And if that wasn't enough, he's also lead the development of Quest ESG strategy.  So Jim, congratulations. I look forward to working very closely with you through this transition. Thanks, Jim. Now at the same time Mark is planning to retire this year. Mark has been in his role for more than eight years, and helped navigate us to the strong position where it is today. We have begun a process in which I will be working closely with Jim to identify Quest's new CFO, and Mark will participate in the selection process. He will remain in the role through the transition.  Mark, I want to thank you for your many contributions, your partnership and your friendship. You've been a key member of our leadership team and we have transformed Quest and accelerated its growth. Now turning to our results, we closed out 2021 with another record year of revenue, earnings and cash from operations. Our base business recovered throughout the year, and we experienced strong demand for COVID-19 testing services. So for the full year 2021, total revenues grew by more than 14% to $10.8 billion.  Earnings per share increased by nearly 49% on a reported basis to $15.55, and more than 27% on an adjusted basis to $14.24. Cash provided by operations increased by more than 11% to $2.2 billion. And for the fourth quarter, total revenues were $2.7 billion, a decrease of roughly 9% versus 2020 when COVID-19 volumes were surging. Earnings per share were $3.12 on a reported basis, and $3.33 on an adjusted basis, both down approximately 26% versus the prior year.  So I'd like to share some perspective on the role of COVID-19 testing going forward. A lot of progress has been made in the battle against COVID-19. But we believe it isn't going away anytime soon. Our molecular product began this year strong, with volumes peaking in January. Testing will continue to play an important part of managing COVID-19, and we believe that molecular testing remains the gold standard. We continued to perform well throughout the surge, maintaining average turnaround times of two days or less for COVID molecular testing.  We will continue to maintain appropriate testing capacities and staffing levels to be prepared for any additional surges throughout this year if they emerge. We also continue to believe there will be a bigger role for serology testing, and how we measure COVID-19 protection going forward. Ultimately we expect COVID-19 testing to eventually more flu-like and become a permanent part of our portfolio going forward.  Now turning to our base business, we continue to make progress executing our two point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence, while we delivered 2% revenue growth on our base business from acquisitions again last year. In the fourth quarter, we acquired the assets of Labtech Diagnostics, a regional independent laboratory, serving physicians and patients primarily in South and North Carolina, Georgia and Florida. This is the first full service laboratory owned by Quest in South Carolina.  We also recently announced our acquisition of Pack Health, a patient engagement company that helps individuals adopt healthier behaviors to improve outcomes. This acquisition will bolster our extended care capabilities. Since 2012, we have completed more than 40 acquisitions, including outreach laboratories, regional independent laboratories and capability enhancing deals. And over the last four years, we've achieved our target of greater than the average of 2% revenue growth on our base business each year from acquisitions.  And then finally, our M&A appetite  remains strong. In 2021, we took full advantage of our strong health plan access, which is approximately 90% of all commercial insurer advice in this country. We also made good progress working together with our plans to help companies and their employees save money by reducing denials and out of network leakage. Our clients also recognize the value of working with us and we have grown our health plan revenues faster than our overall revenues to the best level we've ever seen.  Hospital health system revenues have grown more than 20% compared to 2019 levels, excluding COVID-19 testing, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contract. Our performance in 2021 benefited from our two largest PLS contracts to-date, Hackensack Meridian Health and Memorial Hermann. Altogether our PLS business without COVID-19 exceeded a record $500 million in annual revenue last year. Hospitals continuously faced pressure throughout the pandemic. Post-pandemic we believe the same will be true.  We believe there will be a continued consolidation and ongoing challenges that afford Quest an opportunity to implement our flexible solutions that help hospitals become more effective and productive. Advanced diagnostics is critical to the future of healthcare. We're building strong momentum in our key growth drivers, which include consumer and hereditary genetics, oncology and pharma services. In 2021 these test categories accounted for several 100 million dollars of advanced diagnostics portfolio, and they are growing more than 25% versus 2020, and nearly 33% versus 2019.  We are investing aggressively in areas with potential for future differentiation to grow our advanced diagnostics value proposition, including automatic tests, next gen sequencing, bioinformatics, the sales force and customer service. We're leveraging our scale and expertise to give patients and fighters greater access to important innovations such as liquid biopsy, and digital pathology. Advanced diagnostics is one of the fastest growing areas of our portfolio. Our strategy and investments in this area will enable us to achieve high single digit revenue growth going forward.  Now we're equally excited about the opportunities we see in our direct-to-consumer test vertical. Revenues for QuestDirect services nearly doubled to more than $70 million in 2021, driven by both the base business growing and COVID-19 testing. We expect that non-COVID consumer diagnostic market will experience double digit growth over the next several years. And we're on track to build a $250 million direct-to-consumer business by 2025. We're ramping up our investments in to business, launching a new improved digital experience later this year. And we're also investing in enhancements to the in-person customer experience at our patient service centers.  So lots of good stuff in 2022. We're building on our long term relationships with Walmart by recently launching a consumer initiated laboratory testing on walmart.com, through our solution powered by QuestDirect. And the MyQuest platform now has nearly 23 million users, up more than 3 million in the past quarter. We are very excited about our longer term growth opportunities in advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing and our increasing investments we made in 2021 to strengthen our business and accelerate growth beyond the pandemic.  These investments were made possible with the record cash and earnings we generated over the past two years. We shared part of our two point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain laser focused on improving both operation quality and efficiency which go hand in hand. Through 2021 the Invigorate program exceeded our goal of 3% productivity improvement. We made good progress last year in procurement supply savings as well as reducing unplanned denials, and improving patient collections at the time of service.  While we faced modest inflationary wage pressure in 2021, on the supply cost side, we have more than offset any increases with cost savings from our suppliers. Historically, our Invigorate productivity savings have been net of any inflationary increases. Beyond that we continue to drive additional productivity improvements with platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence.  Now turning to our sales force -- excuse me, now turning to our workforce. Quest employees are highly engaged, based on results of our quality surveys. In a challenging labor market, we are focused and are still seeing improvement and engagement in retention. Our team has done a lot to create an inspiring workplace. And we continue to do everything we can to attract, recruit and retain talent. We're entering 2022 in a strong position within the lab industry and more broadly throughout healthcare. Our base business is poised to build off the record revenues we've achieved last year and we're investing to accelerate growth. We expect to see continued demand for COVID-19 testing services, albeit at lower levels than the last two years. The delay of the 2022 PAMA cuts announced last year was a good outcome for industry and Medicare beneficiaries. However, we will continue to be hard at work in 2022, with our trade association and Members of Congress with the goal of arriving at a permanent fix to PAMA.  We remain committed to our capital employment strategy of returning the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. This morning, we raised our dividend for the 11th time since 2011. We expect to have more than $1 billion in cash available this year for M&A and share repurchases. So putting it all together, our 2022 guidance reflects strong momentum and investment in our base business, balanced with the inevitable but expected decline in COVID-19 testing revenues.  Before turning over to Mark, I'd like to recognize and thank once again, all of our employees who really have been at the frontlines of the pandemic and continue to serve the healthcare needs of patients who depend on Quest every day. Now Mark will provide more detail on our performance and our 2022 guidance. Mark? Thanks Mark. Well, the Sunrise  had another record year providing critical COVID-19 testing for our country and delivered record revenues, earnings and cash from operations. We also grew our base businesses to a record level of 19% versus the prior year. Quest is well positioned in 2022 to deliver on its commitments. I'm proud of the incredible accomplishments of our 50,000 Quest employees throughout the pandemic. And finally, our team is strong, the business has never been better, and Quest's future is bright as we begin a gradual transition to new leadership.  Thank you. Be happy to take your questions. Hey, Jack. Thanks Jack. Yeah, thanks, Jack, for the question. There is a lot of pressure in our industry, and particularly at hospitals. And so we are seeing continued interest and are working with hospital systems and helping them become more efficient and productive with their professional lab services business. That continues to be a big opportunity. You saw in our prepared remarks it grew nicely over the last couple of years. We have a half a billion dollar business, and therefore that moves, it moves our enterprise a significant level. So that's number one.  Number two, is we are very strong, and we continue to drive operational excellence. As you all know, this is not new, it's institutionalized in Quest. We believe we have the cadence and the capabilities to continue to offset any inflationary pressure we have. And we've done that. We did it last year, we'll continue to do that going forward. And as I said, in my introductory remarks, our array included Invigorate. We talked about inflationary pressures on our cost of sales. By the Invigorate savings is a net number. So any increases, offset by the saving always been positive for us and getting more savings than cost increases.  And so despite, some pressures that we see, because of the current times, we're offsetting that, and going forward, we do see that smaller laboratories will have a tougher time keeping up with some of these structures. And therefore, we do have an advantage. We saw the acquisition, we just did a flap jack in South Carolina; we are achieving that 2% growth from acquisitions. So therefore, we believe our strategy has positioned us nicely going forward to take advantage of the changes in front of us given this different times than we've ever seen. So Mark anything you'd like to add to that. Yeah, so to be clear, except for referral network, we have a JV with Sonora Quest. So we wanted to make sure that people were aware that we're doing some math around referral on the testing volumes that we don't actually to record that revenue, because we have a minority ownership stake. So we get a proportionate share of the earnings from Sonora Quest, as we do with our other minority holdings, as we do with our majority holdings to equity earnings. So we just wanted to drive that transparency.  But in terms of pricing, and so on, so forth, I won't comment specifically on Sonora Quest. But it's not dissimilar, it's not a totally different profit structure than the things that we do ourselves. In Jack, during this less than 5% of our total volume is sent out to a referral lab. At this point in time, its effect on zero. So it's only during a surge, that we have to rely on external partner labs to help us.  Yes, what I did refer to Jack, and maybe that's what you were asking about was non-traditional channels. And so that's not where we're sending the work. It's actually how we're getting the specimens. So a lot of the work especially early was through traditional channels, or hospital partners, where we were going anyways, to collect specimens, and we would leverage all the Quest Logistics, in cases where we had people going to our ACE trauma centers, we're leveraging that.  In this case, we're actually getting it from other providers, CVS is the most notable one. As we do that, we have to have an incremental logistics structure with that incremental logistic runs. Then we do pay a fee. You kind of think about it kind of like phlebotomy, but all the work they do to collect the specimen, to engage the administrative costs of the patient to give them the results, and so there is a cost that maybe people weren't aware of when we're not getting that specimen to our traditional infrastructure. Operator, next question? Good morning, Ann. Yeah, so thanks for the question, Ann. It's important one. So first off, we're not deviating from our long term outlook. So we've shared a long term outlook in March of 2021. And while the CAGRs are going to change, because we're going to have a stronger year in 2022, and the carriers I quoted that that time, were putting 2022 forward, the absolute numbers we're not deviating from because they're largely the base fitness. So we still assume that COVID will materially decline, you know, time will tell. At that point, it's really all-round our base business.  So when people are looking at the current profitability of the base business, and I can understand how this happens. One of the flaws of that is that there really -- you can't really do the two in isolation. So let me give some examples. Because we've had such a surprisingly strong year, this year relative to what we expected, driven by COVID, we're paying a significantly higher incentive performance bonus. And that's across the whole employee base. And, right now, that would not be expected to be repeated next year.  So that, quote, inflated our costs. And so to assign all of that cost against the base business, which is what implicitly it's done, when you do COVID revenue times a certain margin drop through, and then you assume back against the base business, that is not accurate. The other thing is, we have significant incremental costs related to the pandemic, which I mentioned in the prepared remarks, around $50 million of cost. If COVID really goes away, we would expect those costs will largely go away. And those costs are really be assigned to COVID, not to the base business.  We had quite a bit of overtime later in the year. And that was related to employee absences driven by the COVID surge, and we spent about $25 million more in 2021, then we historically spend in over time. And we would expect that would go away, as well, as COVID starts to step back. And so again, that that s implicitly put against the big business, when you do the high level math that I've seen a lot of people do. And so the way to think about the base business is obviously from our guidance, we are hundreds of millions of dollars above where we were in 2019.  We expect to be back to the growth that we were experiencing pre-pandemic. I know, it seems like a long time. But if you look at the first two months, and we mentioned this several times of 2020, before the pandemic started, even after a full year of the network access teams we have in 2019, we're still growing mid-single digits. We're going to get back to that growth, okay, in the base business. And the profitability of the base business is going to be similar to what it was before 2019.  So hopefully, that puts all the pieces together for you. Obviously, there's anything I can clarify, I'd be happy to take a follow up. Right, so some of those will ramp down, because there are discrete investments to get us where we need to get to. So for instance, a big piece of that is building what we need for our consumer is fantastic. And to move from where we were to a more Amazon like, not that we'll get completely there, but experience for patients who want to find tests and order it, pay their bill, et cetera is expensive. It takes a lot of work with marketing analytics to do the appropriate marketing and understanding of customer preferences, and respond to customers in appropriate way. A lot of IT investment in the near term to get us to that future state.  Now as we're growing that business to a $0.25 billion, which is what we said we would get to by 2025, there are going to be some ongoing costs, because we're adding people to support that business. It isn't a grown up business. And there are going to be some variable costs with that. However, as we grow those businesses, we're going to grow fast. And so some of those ongoing costs are going to get paid for that faster growth. And then I would say similarly, advanced diagnostics, as we accelerate that growth, some of the resources we're adding today that we're calling out pre that growth are going to be in the run rate and profitability going forward.  So the costs don't go away completely, but they will ramp down because some of this is kind of startup expenses. And then that revenue, obviously in the end, the margin is going to pay for those incremental costs over the next several years.  Only it's after that . Remember, when we talked about this year, these investments really started in the back half of 2020. And we talked about an exceptional year in 2020. We talked about an exceptional year in 2021. And therefore we took advantage of the opportunity invested in accelerated growth entirely consistent with what we share with you as our growth portfolio portfolio. And what you're seeing in our results, our ranges, the benefits of those investments, you're seeing great growth in our focus areas of advanced diagnostics. I highlighted those areas of our portfolio that we focus on.  And these are not insignificant portions of our portfolio. I share my  several 100 millions of dollars of focus for us that are growing strong double digits versus last year versus 2019. And then secondly, is our consumer initiative testing business has grown considerably. We talked about $70 billion, almost half to 250 . And so therefore, we're already starting to see the benefits. So as with any of that we certainly expect a business return. We're getting some evidences of return already. '21 looks like more of it than '22. And so when we get into '23, you got to track that.  They were not served in the beginning. What we're putting on right time is exactly what we laid out on Investor Day. That is, we have a baseline coming out of '22 that we believe in, and what we just shared in our '22 guidance is entirely consistent with that. And we will continue to grow our earnings. The high growth, we highlighted 7% to 9%, and that will continue through '23 and '24. So we feel what we've done so far, and what we delivered is entirely consistent with what we believe the prospects of -- we do believe the opportunity in front of us are even more attractive than before, because we found the proceeds, was relative to accelerate the program was real. Operator, we're going to go to the next question. I just want to let everyone know, we won't go past the bottom of the hour. We have a lot of folks in queue. We want to get to all your questions. Operator? Hey, A.J. A.J., thanks. We continue to believe that we can continue to deliver that 2% growth off our base business going forward. We've delivered that in the past, and we have every reason to believe that we will continue going forward. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see hospitals looking at what we've done with other hospitals, and opportunity for them to rely on us as the testing and that product continues to build. And we continue to look at some outreach purchases with hospitals.  And then, as I mentioned, Labtech was a good example of a regional laboratory and a good piece of the United States that we picked up as well. And we continue to look at acquisitions that build on our portfolio. Remember, we have this lens of focusing on general diagnostics. Jim Davis, runs that business, in addition to that advanced diagnostics. But the third pieces are those services that take the information that we generate, and we provide services, and we do this employer population health. And we built on that business to work with health plans, on helping them manage the risk with the data and providing services that help them do that.  So Pack Health fits into that direction for the company. And we've done some other acquisitions that help us with that direction as well. And you're going to hear more about -- we will continue to invest in that space going forward. And also in your question, does the management change slow us down in any way and here what we might do an acquisition, I would say to the contrary, you know, Jim's been part of the management team for over eight years. He's highly engaged in all acquisitions. He's been instrumental in executing all of our acquisitions. And all the businesses that he participated in are always part of the funnel building that we have.  So Jim any remarks about the 40 acquisitions we've done, and your team to find more opportunities. Hey, A.J. Hey, Patrick. Yeah. Thanks Patrick. Well, so there's a lot of attention these days on inflationary pressures. And we think we've handled those questions. We think it's all very manageable for us, in terms of our operational excellence programs, and finding the productivity, we need to offset it. So that's one piece of the equation. The other piece is what you're bringing up, is around pricing. And we feel good about what we delivered in that regard.  Matter of fact, if you look at the results for '21, what you find is that their unit price changes, and this is freezing everything from volume in meds, and just looking at unit price changes is below that 100 basis points that we typically are guiding you to dial into expectations going forward. And that's not just for our commercial insurance contract. It's all our businesses, our hospital business, it's our client business, independent of what whose clients might be, physicians or some other organization we work with.  So we continue to make progress on that. And we're particularly encouraged by the discussions we're having with our plans. We've shared in the past that actually, in the past, several negotiations, we've actually introduced price increases. And it is actually helping us that in fact, there is inflationary pressure across all of healthcare. So therefore, we're not alone, since we're a labor based business to pass along some of those costs to them.  So we're making good progress. And I say that the other piece of this, Patrick is, we continue to deliver great value. Our quality gets better, our service gets better. And we do that in a very competitive price already. And many of these plans believe that's in the best interest of them and their membership of growing share, is to make sure they rely on a handful of top flight laboratories, in the case of United Healthcare, they call that for labs network. And we had applied to that. And we had to demonstrate with evidence that, in fact, we have great quality. We have great service, and we're doing at very competitive prices.  So that trend will continue. When you talk about that, we're going to eventually keep on pushing us to deliver more and more value, which helps you in terms of managing your network. We, in many cases are going to start looking at some price increases going forward. So good progress there. Thanks for asking the question. Mark, anything you want to add? Yeah. So what we're assuming in our values is getting some ranges of what we think COVID testing will be. Obviously, it's going to start higher in the first quarter, it's going to go down, as we're hopeful that this current surge will decline throughout the spring and into the summer. And as you mentioned, we did get the 90 day extension. And then we're not planning in the guidance that that will be extended, but we just don't know. So therefore, we're always assuming the worst case. And that if that were to come down, yes, we do believe there will be some price changes, if you will, with some of our partners.  But again, what we've implied in the guidance is kind of volumes and some decline in pricing. And also the assumption that we're not going to get a renewal of the emergency order. But again, we don't know that. So Mark anything you'd like to add? Next question? Go ahead Mark. So to remind you, our base business in '21 was larger than what we had in 2019. So it has grown. So it has recovered. And we're going to grow on top of that. And that's implied in our guidance for base business. And we intentionally broke out basis from COVID assumptions for '22. So you can kind of dissect who or what's going on with that business. And I keep on reminding you of investments that we're making are part of our base business. And we started those investments in '21. They continue in '22, and therefore, that's going to help us accelerate growth.  And as Mark said, we feel very confident about the profitability of our base systems. And by the way, when I said in my introductory remarks, is we do not believe COVID is going to entirely go away. It's going to be part -- a permanent part of our portfolio. So you should assume there's some COVID testing in '23 as well. We will continue to still play a role with our PCR testing. And we believe there's a growing role for serology particularly related to our ability to be able to provide some insight around the protection that individuals have in their bodies. And we're going to have more on that to come.  But you put it together is -- and we believe the prospects for '23 and beyond are quite bright. So thank you. Operator, next question. Yeah. Well, let me start, and then my colleagues will round it out, I'm sure. So this isn't going away anytime soon. I think obviously, that we're going to have COVID in '23. And we're going to provide testing around that. And as you know, because you're living with it everyday, like the rest of us, when somebody has some symptoms, you're ruling out COVID. In many cases, that is a PCR test, and that will continue. So therefore, you don't think about just being flu, but it's any type of respiratory illness, and it could be a common cold or another respiratory illness. So there'll be continuation of that, going forward.  And also, we keep on highlighting the value of serology. There is going to be increased role for us to provide insight on how much protection people have from vaccines or from natural immunity. And as we know, that's changing over time. And people want to have that insight to, manage the risk and work with their physician on that. So we think there, there's going to be increased value in that. So we do believe, in '23, this is going to be a permanent part of our portfolio.  It's hard right now to scale that and we'll learn more as we get into '22. But when we think about it, we actually think of this as an additional portion of a product line that we didn't have before the pandemic. So we actually decided that it was helpful to, achieve the value we think we have. And then as Jim said, base business continues to be in really strong shape. We crossed the growth of '19 sooner in '21, we're entering '22 in . Our growth prospects, there continue to be ones that we continue to work. So that should continue to be a good opportunity for ourselves.  So we're filling our chips together well, and COVID is going to products provide more fuel for us to make these investments in our base business that help us and 23. So we Yes, we're focused on what the costs are, but we only make these investments if in fact, we expect to get the returns and you'll see those returns, both in '22. But also in '23 and beyond. So Mark anything you'd like to that? If you look at our volumes are impressive. We've had a challenge this year, because of the infection rate, and therefore our ability not to be able to fail to deliver on cooling , which is more capacity and lower costs. But that will come back with infection rate, which dropped. But as we go forward with this, we start to see this becoming more of an epidemic and less of a pandemic, then there's a lot of players in this marketplace, and Jim and his team are entirely focused on what we have for sure today, and what we could do going forward to gain some share going forward.  So when you think about the opportunity around COVID, if you look at that market, you think about Quest Diagnostics, you think about the dynamics of the short run, where there's been some opportunistic players. We're not optimistic. This is going to be part of a permanent part of our portfolio. And therefore we also are pushing hard, and making sure that we get what we believe what you have to share in the short term. But also in the long term, we think there might be an opportunity as well to pick up some share. Jim, you'd like to add to that. Operator, next question. Yeah, I mean, you can -- yeah, I mean, you can do the math. Yes. I mean... Okay, good. So what we -- Mark just said what we said is, we've always provided our outlook and guidance for our mix  per share, because we do have a mix of business, we do have some lower margin business, that might be a good value creating opportunity for us, we're going to go after it like a PLS business. So our guidance for EPS would be expansion of EPS over time, rebasing it, if you will, for these changes that we've seen for the last two years. And Mark has reiterated our belief that our base business will fuel good opportunities for us to continue to deliver against that.  By the way, as we continue to gain share, variable gross margin is quite good. And as I said, we also believe there's going to be some COVID in '23. And it's hard to size it right now, but it's not going to go away soon. Operator, next question. Great, thanks for the question. I'll weigh in and turn to Jim to add to the answer. We've been working on operational excellence for over a decade, and it has become institutionalized in our company culture, and embedded in how we do things. And it is, is a platform for how we're going to continue to grow. So your comment was around costs. We don't talk about cost, we talked about productivity, because there's a lot of aspects of what we do around Invigorate and some actually helps the top line, some actually helps getting more output with less labor. And yes, some helps us to become more efficient by less input from some of the materials that we use.  So we looked at an aggregate, and we continue to be bullish on our prospects. We believe that it is the ingredients for us to continue to deliver great value. That is when we do this we improve our quality, or service gets better. And oh, by the way, we become more and more productive to be able to make investments to fuel the growth. So it all fits together. And when we talk about this, and we talked about at Investor Day. We see an enormous opportunity for us to continue to digitize and innovate in operational excellence.  And so some of you have had the opportunity to tour through our latest lab of the future and that's our new facilities -- facility in Clifton, New Jersey. Sometimes if you come in, you'll see what we've done and take some of the learnings out of our Marlborough facility up in the Boston area. We brought that down to Clifton and we built on it. And that also gives us advantages of some consolidation with some of our new platforms. But Jim and the team are now taking that, and thinking about okay, what's next?  Okay, so we think about innovation in our space, yes, there's innovation in terms of testing, and as far as diagnostic information services. But we equally think there's a lot of innovation and opportunity for us to move forward. So we continue to invest. And we talk about investments, we talk about the use of cash. As you notice, we've been putting about $40 million a year into our capital budget, which is investments and frankly, a lot of our innovation that allow us to fuel this productivity game. So Jim? So we're bullish on the prospects of continuing to drive productivity. I always react to this as a cost cutting goal. And this is not all about cost cutting goal. This is about working smarter. And this has been a key part of our strategy. And it fuels growth. And Jim mentioned some of the areas. I picture my internship  also digital pathology, which revolutionized our ability to diagnose and treat and to do that more productively. And this week, Jim is going up another laboratory to take a look at where we're going to make our next investment this year.  So we're going to invest in the space. And we have a lot more opportunity in front of us. So it's exciting. Operator next question please. Yeah, so what I can share is, go back to what we said in the prepared remarks, our consumer business was about $70 million last year, between the base and COVID, we did $2.7 million of COVID revenue. So the consumer initiated COVID testing was very small, at this point, and, it's strengthening. And again, as I said, we continue to enhance our website, when people go for that ordering, and testing and so on. But there's still more to come in terms of enhancing that experience for consumers and driving awareness for people. As you know, we're competing with a lot of people who see these stand up operations in parking lots, and so on and so forth, which draw their attention.  So we're working on making sure that they know we can do this and initiate themselves as opposed to going to a doctor or hospital for this. And we expect to get stronger and stronger moving forward as we enhance our overall consumer business through these investments we just mentioned.  In terms of the margin profile, it's really not -- it's not all that different between the consumer and consumer can add in different ways. They can come to our patient draw center and have it done there. We do have home collection kits where they can be sent to their home. So a little different structure, but not materially different in profitability.  Operator next question. So thanks for the question. And as we said, we were thankful that it was delayed, again, the one year offset, as Mark indicated to 23. We think that's good for us, because it will gave us some time this year, to keep on working on a permanent fix with Congress. And we have been very active working with Congress last year. And as you know, Congress was very busy with the Infrastructure Bill, and other business and therefore we're fortunate enough to get in the postponed it, but it allows us time this year to keep on working on this to get a permanent fix.  We're encouraged by the level of support, brought up the importance of testing and the importance of having a strong industry. We're getting strong, bipartisan support, both from the House and from the Senate. We made a proposal of what we think should be changed to improve the data collection process, the sampling of market based data. We continue to support the notion and the philosophy of PAMA that is we should be paid a commercial rate. But we believe that CMS has it wrong .  And in parallel with the Congress, we continue to have our lawsuit against CMS and the trade association. The judge has heard the arguments we'll see if we get some indication on a decision on that. Hard to call that, but that's still in the works as well. So our work right now this year is to push for permanent fix to PAMA. And we're better positioned now because the pandemic than before the pandemic because of the strength of this industry here in global awareness and appreciation of what we've done and the need for strong laboratory industry going forward. Operator last question please. Sure, so let me start with that one. Because I think there was some questions around maybe with their turnaround time suffered, and we didn't get the $25 fee that comes with some of the government payers couple the current pairs. And actually, not really, AWR in Q4 was absolutely similar to what has been in the previous quarters. And our turnaround time performance was outstanding. We did in January when the surge came, we did a little bit, we did have a little bit of a hit to our turnaround time. But obviously, that's all contemplated in the guidance that we just provided and it wasn't a huge amount.  When you -- back to the early question, bonuses, and the bonuses, when we look at the bonuses, you know, most of it is really our 50,000 employees. So people think about bonuses, must be senior management. Most of the cost is really, we pay 3% bonus to even our wage workers. And then obviously, we have other staff members that you know, at higher targets. And every year we budget for what we call, one x whatever that target is. So for most of the people do 3%. And based on performance, and we feel we've had reasonable stretch performances, when we had historically, we have not paid significantly above 1x. And we've had a number of years where it's below 1x.  But the COVID, unpredictability and the surge in revenues, enabled us to pay our employees significant bonuses, in 2020. And again, in 2021. And so if you look at, without getting too specific, and we've shared a number in the past, a $3 billion wage bill, that's gone up in the last couple of years as we've grown the company. So you can kind of as a floor, say 3%, obviously a little higher, because if people want a higher bonus, that's about 1x. And then, we're paying a bonus that's substantially higher than that, in 2021, like we did in 2020.  The other thing is, we did pay out a $500 payment to the majority of our employees to compensate them for COVID expenses. In 2020, we adjusted it out of our adjusted earnings, because we were seeing COVID as temporal and extraordinary. But once you get to your second time doing it, even though I still think it's extraordinary, we just decided not to adjust it out. So we did have over a $20 million payment, late in the year, $500 to our wage employee and some of our lower compensated professionals as well.  So those are a couple of things that would go away and not be repeated like somehow, we had another surprising COVID year in 2022 like we had in 2021 Yeah, let's say it's less than $100 million, but substantially more than $50 million. Thank you. Very good. Well, thanks, it's been a great session with you all. Thanks for all the great questions. And again, thanks for joining the call today and we appreciate your support. You guys have a great day."

            "name": "Mark Guinan",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. I appreciate the kind words. I just want to take a minute to say that I'm proud to be part of an important company that makes a positive contribution to the country, and I've enjoyed being part of it. Now it's time for me to step back and retire. I'm looking forward to participating in the process to identify my successor who can support Steve and Jim in Quest's next phase of growth. Thanks Steve. In the fourth quarter consolidated revenues were $2.74 billion, down 8.6% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 8.5% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected low revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by continued growth in our base testing revenue. Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew approximately 6% in the fourth quarter, and was up more than 1% excluding acquisitions.  Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 1.3% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 1.1%. Compared to our fourth quarter 2019 baseline total base testing volumes increased by more than 10%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 5% versus 2019 and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year. The progress we've made in our base business throughout 2021 continued in the fourth quarter, and base testing volumes remained consistent with our prior outlook.  As many of you know COVID-19 testing volumes moderated early in the fourth quarter, following the peak of the Delta wave in September, but then surged again in early December as the Omicron variant spread across the U.S. Together with our JV partners Sonora Quest, we resulted approximately 7.9 million molecular tests. Quest alone resulted roughly 7.3 million molecular tests and nearly 730,000 Serology tests in the fourth quarter. In January, our COVID-19 molecular volumes averaged approximately 120,000 tests per day, and over 139,000 per day, including Sonora Quest, with volumes peaking in the middle of the month.  Revenue per acquisition declined 9.8% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. In the fourth quarter increases in our base revenue per acquisition were more than offset by the impact of recent PLS revenues. Modest unit price headwinds remained consistent with our expectations.  Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $536 million, or 19.5% of revenues, compared to $795 million, or 26.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis operating income in Q4 was $579 million, or 21.1% of revenues, compared to $860 million or 28.6% of revenues last year. As you may recall, updated 2021 guidance we shared in October contemplated a lower adjusted operating margin both year-over-year and versus 3Q. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue and higher COVID-19 testing costs, headcount and wage increases and ramping strategic growth investments.  It's important to note that over time, a growing portion of our COVID-19 molecular testing volumes have come from non-traditional channels, which carry additional expenses and logistics cost. Also spiking COVID-19 positivity rates across the country in December eliminated our tooling capability, which further increased COVID-19 testing costs later in the quarter. In addition, we also experienced higher than anticipated employee healthcare costs in the fourth quarter, primarily related to COVID-19.  Reported EPS was $3.12 in the quarter, compared to $4.21 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.33, compared to $4.48 last year. Cash provided by operations was $2.23 billion in 2021, versus $2.01 billion in the prior year. We completed our $1.5 billion ASR in November, and repurchased that additional 310 million in stock in the fourth quarter. This brings total share repurchases to more than $2.2 billion in 2021. And we ended the year with $872 million on the balance sheet.  Before turning to guidance, I'd like to comment on recent trends we've seen in our labor costs. As Steve noted, we've been managing through a challenging labor environment, while wage inflation including our annual merit increase is expected to be between 3% to 4% this year. The increase in our total salaries, wages and benefits is expected to be below 3% in 2022, given the reset of our annual performance compensation, and lower expected overtime. As a reminder, all of our employees are eligible for annual performance. Now turning to guidance. We are giving full year 2022 results as follows. Revenue is expected to be between $9 billion and $9.5 billion, a decline of approximately 12% to 17% versus the prior year. Base business revenues are expected to be between 8.3 and 8.5 billion, an increase of approximately 3.5% to 6%. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $700 million and $1 billion, a decline of approximately 64% to 75% reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.63 and $8.33, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.65 to $9.35.  Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.6 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our 2022 guidance. As Steve said, we're entering 2022 in a strong position. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average between 65,000 to 80,000 tests per day in Q1, representing a decline from January wells, and approximately 20,000 to 35,000 tests per day for the full year.  For COVID-19 serology volumes the guidance assumes approximately 3,000 tests per day for the full year. Our guidance does not currently anticipate another COVID wave. We will remain ready from an operational standpoint to handle any future surges. Last month, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through April. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period. While the public health emergency could continue to get renewed beyond April, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance.  The revenues generated from COVID-19 testing have afforded us an opportunity to continue to increase investment in our business. As Steve noted earlier, we continued to ramp investment in our growth pillars, particularly the advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing opportunities. We are planning to invest approximately $160 million in our growth initiatives this year, which represents an additional $90 million in investments in 2022 versus 2021.  We also continue to incur hard costs to manage your business through the pandemic, including expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address ongoing supply chain challenges and maintain adequate staffing levels. We currently forecast these expenses to be approximately $50 million in 2022.  As a reminder, we originally expected PAMA cuts of approximately $80 million in 2022. These cuts were delayed one year until 2023. Finally, we ended 2021 with approximately 124 million diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance assumes no change in our share count in 2022, and only enough share repurchases to offset our employee equity programs and to meet our commitment of the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders.  I will now turn it back to Steve. Thanks Jack. Yeah, I think the other thing that's evolving jack that you didn't mention, I'm sure it's on your radar is moves towards transparency in pricing, whether it's surprise billing. Now, certainly is complicated. So even for us, it's not simple, would depend which commercial insurance, depends on who your carrier is and so on. So it's not simple to tell people exactly what their cost is. However, it's absolutely an advantage for the national labs , specifically for Quest. So we're encouraged by some of this. It's kind of one of those secrets that a lot of people aren't aware how much better our value is compared to others.  So we really see that together with some of the things you mentioned as another reason that we're going to continue to pick up share and really return to those historic rates we were having before the pandemic started, with greater access and the knowledge, tools and value that we bring well beyond our price, including our real time estimation tools, including our MyQuest app, and all the other things that really enhance the patient experience. Yeah, just one point of clarification. So the 7% to 9% was when we thought we could do $7.40 $8 in 2022. And we said we'd be at the upper end of that. So you can pick your number between $7.40 and $8, carry forward $7 to $8, through '23 and '24. And that dollar level of EPS is what we're saying we can still do. Obviously, since 2022, is turning out based on our guidance, a lot higher than we said in March, the CAGR is going to be lower. But the absolute numbers we're still committed to at this point. Good morning, A.J. Yeah, I just want to remind people of what we talked about, over our tenure. We have this Invigorate program, drives about 3% productivity. We call it productivity, because some of it is top line enhancing. It's not all around costs. And we've mentioned the fact that we have these pay fors . And one of them has been priced stretched. One of them has been annual labor inflation. And then we talked about the fact that as we got priced in a better place that actually was helping with margin expansion.  So we have enough productivity to do more than the pay fors. So now we look at where we are today, and as Steve mentioned, a much better position. I can't specifically say it's related to inflation. But I can assure you that that is part of the conversation in addition to PAMA, and the value that we bring in, so and so. We've really moved the conversation dramatically from when we started here, to more about value. And fortunately for us, I can share that in the last three national payer contracts, all three of them, we got an increase. That was modest. But you compare that to where we've been historically, great news.  And that also means that even if we have a little more inflation, and I think we talked about this quite a bit, we've got plenty of Invigorate. And that Invigorate now, doesn't need to cover as much of the price erosion that we have historically. And that price erosion that Steve shared is really heavily in the clientele. And as we've talked over the last number of earnings calls that comes from the hospital clients who are under tremendous pressure, and we shared the reasons for that. And also in some states where physicians can do clientele markup, we have that pressure as well.  And really with the commercial payers, we're in a really good place on prices lately. Yeah, just to remind you -- not that I need to remind you all that, the rates that CMS determined at $51. And so while we don't assume post PHE that everything falls immediately there, there's a pretty steep ramp down. And then so for the volume that is in our guidance beyond the PHE in late April, we're assuming a significantly lower reimbursement than we've experienced to-date and that we're expecting to get till late April. Yeah, so. I'm sure you understand Ricky, even if I was willing, I can't really give you an EPS number on the face. So I think the best thing I could do is, point you to pre-pandemic, revenue and earnings and tell you that if you look at the growth in the base business based on what we're giving in guidance, the profitability is not dissimilar. So you can kind of directionally place where that business might be. And the reason I can't really give is back to what I talked about earlier.  So where do I assign the $50 million of pandemic expense? Arguably, if we didn't have COVID testing, we would still have that cost. And you'd say, okay, let's go about your base business. But the truth is that we also have the COVID testing in revenue. So again COVID revenue is going to go into the base business. And then importantly, when you talk about headwinds and tailwinds, we would expect that cost to go away and should be temporary, because it is specifically tied to CDC guidelines and other things.  We talked about some of the others, you know, some things including there, like supply disruptions. I don't know how long that's going to last. And we all know, it's not just in our business. It's across all aspects of life today, and it's modeled to go away in 12 months, not sure. That's certainly something we want to absolutely make sure that we have what we need. And so we are paying premium costs right now, relative to what we did pre pandemics in insurance, get to our patient service centers, our laboratories have everything they need. And that's really kind of our insurance, which fortunately, we can afford to do right now. Because we also do have that COVID revenue and COVID margin.  So really, I think that's the best color I could give you which is the base business is in good shape. We activate Q4 organically back to where we were in 2019. We've done significant M&A over the last couple of years, we've built the PLS business. So beyond the organic clinical business, we're hundreds of millions of dollars higher. And while the profitability and all that may not be precisely the same directionally people could feel confident that the profitability has moved at least to that growth . Yeah, thanks. Brian, it's a great question. And we can't predict with any certainty what's going to happen. I think the two unknowns are, how comfortable will physicians be with taking the specimen sample themselves in the office going forward? And maybe they'll be very comfortable like that with the flu where maybe they'll be like, no, I'd rather I'd rather not handle that. I'd rather not do that point of care test and all the risks that come with that. I'll just send it to a lab. But then the other one, really importantly, the economics. So the payers are going to have a lot of influence on whether this is done.  Now yes, point of care testing, arguably, some people do it for faster turnaround times. But a lot of it is done because they make money off of it. So depending on what the payers decide around point of care reimbursement that will have a large influence on how much of this work comes to us and how much that of it stays in the office. Then let me just stop and ask Jim to comment on this. Yeah, so we intentionally don't really target or comment on margins, because we believe value creation can come at different levels of margin. Then we talked about specifically on PLS, where it's great growth, great return on invested capital. And those are the two biggest correlators to shareholder value creation. But they come at a lower margin. So we don't worry about margin Pito per se, but I understand others do. And so to answer your question, there's a pretty broad range, you know, obviously, one year less than over multiple years when you put a CAGR with a couple 100 basis points differential on the top line and bottom line.  So there's a lot of different combinations. So what I would say is, your EPS number that you mentioned, is not unreasonable. And you can figure out the revenue based on what we said, at Investor Day, and then what we're guiding to this year in terms of the base business, and yeah, at this point, we're not counting on COVID to be significantly larger than maybe a flu business or something like that. But certainly, we don't know. And there's a chance that it could be larger than that. And that will be determined over the next 12 months or so.  So that's about strongest color I can give you right now, is back to what we said. If you're really good about our base business going forward, we're going to adapt to that growth level. And I want to remind everybody that when we grow organically, the drop down is much higher than that 17% or, the 19.5% that we delivered in Q4, and so on. It drops down at a level, you know, 50% or more depending if it's an existing customer, where we're expanding the menu, or it's a new customer, where we do have to invest a little maybe in logistics and in IT for the interfaces.  But growth brings with it margin expansion, in addition to Invigorate. That's why we're confident we can grow earnings faster than top line, from that period forward. about earnings per share. Yeah. And then the other thing is that, I'm not in any position to provide guidance in 2023. So that's why we're focusing every one of the things there. However, when you think about what can happen, COVID can be larger. We don't know, we're not counting at this point. And then we did mention we've got a -- we expect a billion dollars of cash this year. So between opportunity to quite a bit of M&A, and we'll see, or do share repurchases, those also aren't specifically contemplated.  So that's why like locking down to a specific number is really difficult and probably not productive. So I would point you to what we said at investor day, and kind of assuming that that's reasonable if these things don't play out significantly differently from our current view of what 2043 might bring. Yeah. Before Steve addresses that I just want to remind everybody that that $80 million was built into our long term outlook. We just assumed it would happen this year. So again, although it would be a year on year get to us, you know, incrementally in comparison, in the long term outlets, it was assumed that we would get that in 2022. So it's already built that."

            "content": "Hey, thanks Steve, and I really look forward to working closely with you over the next eight months, and ensuring a very successful transition. It's a tremendous honor to have the opportunity to succeed you in Quest and lead Quest into the next stage of our growth. We have a very powerful vision in Quest of empowering better health and diagnostic insights.  Our business strategy is straightforward and well understood. And our company has never been more central to patients and to the health care system, as we've seen during this pandemic. I really look forward to working with the management team and all 50,000 employees to build on the strong foundation that Quest has put in place. Quest's future is really bright. And we're extremely well positioned to continue to create value for shareholders, and all that we serve. Thank you, Jack. Thank you. No, A.J., as Steve said, I've been part of all 40 of those acquisitions. And it's not going to slow down. We're not going to do -- we're going to do smart deals. We're going to be selective, but we're going to continue to build our base business. We're going to continue to find niche applications to build out our events diagnostics portfolio, and we're going to continue to focus on hospital outreach deals, those that are willing to get out of business. We're right there ready to help out. Thank you. Ricky, I would add one other thing. And that's as probably Mark stated at the pace business has recovered in 2019 levels are still not going to interject in terms of a headwind. There's still pent up demand for routine clinical care. If you look at the studies around HIV infection rates, hepatitis C infection rates, the data still indicates that there was a lack of routine clinical care during the pandemic. And we do think that should provide some headwinds going into the later part of this year and next year. Yeah, what we did find during this last surge is we had a series of 10 default partners that we've referred work out to, when we couldn't handle the volume, especially during peak days during the work. And at least 50% of those partners had gotten out of business and decided they just didn't want to rebrand for capacity. So while there may be the physical capacity out there, some of that physical capacity, especially on the PCR side has returned to the clinical kinds of work that those firms were doing, other molecular work.  So that is, I think advantages us in the future, if there is another surge here. Yeah, I think Steve has touched on three key themes, automation, use of artificial intelligence, and the continued digitization of so many products. So Marlborough and Clifton are terrific examples of that. But as you know, they're all brand new laboratories. We've got 20 plus other laboratories in our network. And there's opportunities in every one of those laboratories without building new Greenfield sites to continue that automation journey. In particular, in our processing area, and what we call our fluid handling system, handling of blood and urine.  On the artificial intelligence side, you're going to see us move in pathology, psychology, microbiology, we've got some great examples of each of those departments today. We're deploying artificial intelligence systems that help with the readout of those images. And then Steve mentioned just the continued digitization. Now beyond the immunoassay platform where we consolidated around the , there are still other opportunities like that in our laboratories.  We recently ran a competition in your analysis, so likely to new vendors is next for that platform. And are rolling out those two platforms across all 23 Plus laboratories, it's going to generate a lot of productivity year over year. So as long as we have healthy third party vendors that continue to innovate, those innovations will come to our labs. And we'll continue along that 3% productivity journey. Yeah, I just want to add that, remember, this is not just in the lab. So there's a lot of productivity that's driven outside. And specifically, I'll give two examples, logistics. So we really have an incredible ability to be efficient with logistics, and continue to improve. So we have some cases where we have empty pickups, where we have some customers that don't give us specimens all the time. It's periodic. Now we have the ability and technology to not do that empty pickup. So that's an efficiency. We also get requests for what we call staff pickups, where somebody needs something quick turnaround, et cetera. And so the ability to most efficiently get one of our vehicles there has been enhanced through our technology.  The other one is in our patient draw centers. We really can increasingly move the administrative burdens off the phlebotomist, allow them to do phlebotomy by getting people to go to our website, put in their insurance information, everything. And so the phlebotomist spends a couple less minutes with each patient doing administrative doing phlebotomy. We drive up the productivity in our draw centers.  So those are just a couple examples of productivity gains that aren't really cost reductions, but enhance our ability to do more with the same resources and drive up our quality and everything else outside the laboratory."

I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, CEO and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses from the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control.

Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we had a strong third quarter as COVID-19 molecular volumes increased throughout the summer, while our base business continue to deliver solid volume growth versus the prior year, and 2019. In late summer, we experienced some softness in the base business across the country, but saw a rebound, in September. Importantly, our base business continues to improve sequentially in the third quarter, which speaks to the ongoing recovery. We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher-then-anticipated COVID-19 volumes, as well as continued progress we expect to see in our base business, despite rising labor costs and inflationary pressures. The momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day. So, this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the third quarter of 2021, and update you on our base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results, and talk about our updated outlook and underlying assumptions. But before turning to our results in the third quarter, I'd like to update you on the progress we've made in our quest for health equity initiative, a more than $100 million initiative aimed at reducing healthcare disparities in underserved neighborhoods. Since we've established it, just over a year ago, we have launched 18 programs across the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from supporting COVID-19 testing and vaccination events to educating young students on healthy nutritional choices, to providing funding support for a long-haul COVID-19 clinic in Puerto Rico. Recently, we announced the collaboration with the American Heart Association that will expand research and mentorship opportunities for black and Hispanic scholars to drive hypertension management and COVID-19 relief. We're off to a good start, and I look forward to updating you on our continued progress as Quest for Health Equity enters its second year. Now, turning to our results for the third quarter, total revenue of $2.77 billion, down 40 basis points versus the prior year; earnings per share were $4.02 on a reported basis, down approximately 3% versus the prior year; and $3.96 on an adjusted basis, down 8% versus the prior year. The revenue and earnings declines in the third quarter reflect lower COVID-19 testing in 2021 versus the prior year, partially offset by continued recovery in our base business. Cash provided by operations increased by nearly 20% year-to-date through September, to approximately $1.75 billion. Now, starting with COVID-19 testing, our COVID-19 molecular volumes increased in the third quarter versus the second quarter, due to the spread of the Delta variant over the course of the summer. Testing began to increase meaningfully in mid-July, and peaked in early mid-September. Our observed positivity rate peaked in mid-August, and has steadily been declining across much of the country in recent weeks. We performed an average of 83,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the third quarter, and maintained strong average turnaround times of approximately one day for most specimens throughout the surge. As clinical COVID-19 volumes declined, we are expanding our non-clinical COVID-19 testing to support the return to school, office, travel, and entertainment. We're making testing easy, fast, and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country. We are currently performing K-12 school testing in approximately 20 states, with five additional states ready to come online. We're testing passengers on   cruise lines, and Quest exclusively provided testing at the Boston Marathon earlier this month. In the base business, we continue to make progress on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth, and drive operational excellence. Now, here are some highlights from the third quarter. Our M&A pipeline remained strong. In the third quarter, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition of an independent lab in Florida. We continue to build on our exceptional health plan access of approximately 90% of all commercially insured lives in the United States. At our Investor Day, we discussed how we have fundamentally changed our relationship with health plans, and we continue to see the promise of value-based relationships come to life. So, here's a couple examples. We are working with national health plans to help their self-insured employers -- employer customers improve quality, outcomes, and lower the cost of care for both the employers and their employees. Also, effective October 1, we gained access to one million managed Medicaid members, in Florida, as their coverage transitions to  Sunshine Health Plan. We're getting good feedback from the provider community and our growing testing volumes through this expanded access opportunity. Our hospital health system revenue continues to track well above 2019 levels, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contracts. As we highlighted previously, 2021 performance is benefiting from two of our largest POS contracts to date, Hackensack Meridian Health, and Memorial Hermann. Altogether, our POS business is expected to exceed $500 million in annual revenue this year. Trends in our hospital reference business also remained steady, with third quarter base testing volumes above 2019 levels. We also generated consumer-initiated testing revenue through QuestDirect in the third quarter. While COVID testing has been strong contributor to growth, we expect our base direct-to-consumer testing to more than double this year. Recently, we soft-launched a comprehensive health profile on QuestDirect, similar to our Blueprint for Wellness offering for employers. This expanded health plan -- panel offers a deep dive into consumers' health profile with a battery of tests and biometric measurements to provide a personalized health quotient score that can be used to track health progress over time. And then finally, our MyQuest app and patient portal now has almost 20 million users. In advanced diagnostics, we continue to ramp investments and see strong momentum in key growth drivers. We're seeing growth in non-evasive prenatal testing significantly above 2019 levels, and saw solid contribution in our specialty genetics portfolio from Blueprint Genetics. We continue to work closely with the CDC to sequence positive COVID specimens in an ongoing effort to track emergent variants, expanding all of the work that we performed in the quarter. And then finally, we plan to introduce a test service based on a new FDA-approved companion diagnostic   for a therapy from Eli Lilly for a certain type of high-risk early breast cancer. Quest will be the first laboratory to offer it to physicians, nationally, at the end of the month. Turning to our second strategy, driving operational excellence, we made progress and remain on track to deliver on our targeted 3% annual efficiencies across the business. Last week, we announced that we completed the integration and consolidation of our northeast regional operations into our new 250,000 square-foot next-generation lab, in Clifton, New Jersey. This state-of-the-art highly automated facility services, more than 40 million people across seven states. In patient services, we are seeing all time high numbers of patients making appointments to visit our Patient Service Centers. Now more than 50% of patient service center visits are now by the appointment versus walk-ins. And this enables patients to be very satisfied and also improves our ability to drive productivity for our Phlebotomist. Similar to our immunoassay platform consolidation, we recently procured a highly automated neuro analysis platform that is expected to generate millions in annual savings, once these new systems are standardized across our laboratory network. And then finally, I'd like to recognize and thank all of our nearly 50,000 employees who have worked tirelessly to provide critical COVID-19 testing to our country throughout the pandemic, and continue to serve the healthcare needs of patients who depend on Quest every day. As a demonstration of our gratitude, we're assisting our employees with a one-time payment of up to $500 designed to reimburse costs, they incurred during the pandemic. Additionally, another year of pandemic pressures and travel restrictions have made it very difficult for many employees to take their hard earned time off. Therefore, we're providing a payout of most unused paid time off for our hourly employees to ensure they don't forfeit their earned unused time at year end. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, to provide more details on the third quarter financial performance and updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mark?\nMark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.77 billion, down 0.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were essentially flat when compared to the prior year, which is reflected by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the third quarter of last year, largely offset by the strong ongoing recovery in our base testing revenue. Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew approximately 6% in the third quarter, and it was up nearly 2%, excluding acquisitions. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 5.3% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 2%. Compared to our third quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 9%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 4% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year. We saw a rebound in our base business volumes in September, following a modest softening in August that we believe was at least partially caused by the rise of the delta variance and the timing of summer vacations. Importantly, our base business revenue and volume grew sequentially in the third quarter. This helps illustrate the ongoing recovery as historically total revenue and volume typically stepped down in Q3 versus Q2 due to summer seasonality. As most of you know, COVID-19 testing volumes grew in the third quarter versus Q2, which was in line with broader COVID-19 testing trends across the country. We resulted approximately 7.6 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the third quarter. So, far in October, average COVID-19 molecular volumes have declined approximately 10% from where we exited Q3, but are still above the levels we expected prior to the surge of the delta variance, while the base business continues to improve since September. Revenue per requisition declined 5.4% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume and to a lesser extent recent PLS wins. Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $652 million or 23.5% of revenues compared to $718 million or 25.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q3 was $694 million or 25% of revenues, compared to $831 million or 29.8% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by the recovery in our base business. Reported EPS was $4.02 in the quarter, compared to $4.14 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.96, compared to $4.31 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.75 billion through September, year-to-date, versus $1.46 billion in the same period last year. Turning to guidance, we have raised our full-year 2021 outlook as follows. Revenue is expected to between $10.45 and $10.6 billion, an increase of approximately 11% to 12% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be in the range of $4.69 and $15.09, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $13.50 and $13.90. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated outlook. We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to continue to decline from Q3 levels throughout the remainder of the year. At the low end of our outlook, we assume approximately 50,000 molecular tests per day in Q4, and serology volumes to hold relatively steady at approximately 5,000 tests per day. As you may know, late last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days, through late January. We expect reimbursements of clinical COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the remainder of the year. However, we continue to assume average reimbursements to trend lower in Q4 as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes potentially shift from clinical diagnostic testing to more return-to-life surveillance testing. Finally, we continue to assume low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in Q4, versus 2019. Getting to the midpoint or higher end of our outlook ranges assumes stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and/or stronger growth in our base business. I will now turn it back to Steve.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we had a strong third quarter. We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher-than-anticipated COVID-19 volumes, as well as our continued progress we expect to see in our base business. And finally, the momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day. So, now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue.  Our first question comes from Kevin Caliendo, UBS. Your line is now open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin Caliendo: Thank you. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for all the details and the guidance for '21. I really want to talk about into 2022, and sort of you reiterated your guidance from March, which I believe it was at the higher end of the $7.40 to $8.00 range. And I'm just wondering at this point, what are the assumptions baked in for COVID testing into next year? Do you anticipate that it's going to continue? Do you anticipate there's going to be a meaningful decline? Any color around how you think COVID testing will proceed into next year?\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark, why don't you start, and then I'll follow.\nMark Guinan: Sure. And, Kevin, just to be clear upfront, we haven't provided guidance yet for 2022; we provided an outlook. And we did confirm that today. And things have largely played out where we saw them for 2022, back in March, and base volumes have recovered. And we thought we were ahead in June, when it was close to being flat to 2019, and potentially saw some upside, obviously, with Delta, it's -- it took a little bit of a step back. But we still expect to enter 2022 with a base volume utilization level similar to pre-pandemic, so that's good. The second thing is we did assume that COVID will continue at a much lower level than we saw in '20 and '21, but still to be significant, and certainly much larger than our current flu testing. And we've referenced, in the past, that at some point COVID testing will still be here, but maybe more on the level of flu testing. At this point, we feel comfortable with what we had assumed, back in March, around continued need for COVID testing for PCR. And we envision a stronger role for serology going into 2022, and think that's a potential. So, we feel good about that. And then, we did reference inflationary pressures. We certainly have longer-term contracts on a lot of our purchases, but things, like fuel, certainly were subject to inflation in the near-term and going into 2022. And then most notably, as many have talked, there's certainly inflation in wages and in benefits, and especially in wages. And that, as we look at that, we gave a range, and we still feel very comfortable that when you put all those pieces together, that the $8.5 billion baseline for revenue and the $7.40 to $8.00 is certainly still deliverable, maybe in slightly different way, and -- but still very comfortable, that that's likely where we're going to land when we do finally provide guidance for 2022.\nKevin Caliendo: Just as a quick follow-up, can you in any way quantify the higher inflationary pressures, supply chain, any of that? Is there any way to put numbers around that?\nMark Guinan: Yes. So, I'm sure you're most interested in 2022, so, we'll see what we can provide when we come out with guidance, in early next year, to provide clarity. Certainly at this point, well, we're experiencing some of that given the performance of the business; it hasn't prevented us from significantly over-delivering our previous guidance. So, we'll take a note of consideration, Kevin. We appreciate the question. We'll see what we can do when we talk more about next year.\nKevin Caliendo: Thank you.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Yes, our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut, Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. So, just a follow-up just as I think about costs and all the moving pieces. Obviously, the Clifton lab just opened. So, how are you thinking about the flow-through of the benefits from that and how it would potentially offset some of the inflationary pressures that you're seeing on the cost side?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, so, thanks, Brian, for the question. So, as you know, and what I reiterated in our prepared remarks, we've been marching with our two-point strategy for some time. And the second strategy is to drive operational excellence, and we have maintained, and just reiterated, that we do believe we can continue to deliver 3% efficiency or productivity gains going forward. And that 3% comes from a variety of programs across Quest Diagnostics, and one of which is what we did in Clifton. And I actually also reiterated a couple other programs on the prepared remarks, are working with our suppliers with new integrated platforms, what we're done around immunoassay, what we're doing around our   analysis is -- are two good examples of more work we can get the benefits from, and there's others. So, there's a lot more efficiencies in productivity we can continue to get. And as I said before, this isn't cost-cutting, this is improvement. And so, every time we make an improvement in our operation we expect our quality improves, and our service performance improves, and it has. So, we continue to make progress. You see it in our numbers this year, and you'll continue to see it in our '22 numbers as well. And that's always been used to offset headwinds, and we do have headwinds, we've had headwinds from wage bill increases in the past, albeit maybe it could be a little bit higher going forward, given what we see in the labor market. And then second is, we have seen headwinds from price consequences as well, which we've been able to offset, and we'll have some of those in '22 as we've outlined before. And then, also any additional inflationary pressures, we will be able to offset most of that, if not all of that, to be able to hit the outlook, and we just reiterated our confidence, our ability to do that. So, hopefully that's helpful.\nMark Guinan: Yes, I just wanted to add a reference that the Clifton lab and its increased productivity efficiency is really part of our invigorate work that we talk about 3% productivity every year. It's not over and above or separate whatever  common is that what we've done there like we did up in Massachusetts. We have added more automation. Obviously, as you add automation, you insulate yourself a little bit from labor inflation. So, certainly, we have that going as we operate that lab, but it is built-in, and part of what my assumptions I had putting together that outlook for 2022 that we would achieve that ongoing 3% efficiency is not something specially\u2026\nBrian Tanquilut: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Good morning, Ricky.\nRicky Goldwasser: Hi, good morning. So, one follow-up question on the cost, I mean, clearly we're all interested in a magnitude of the potential impact of paper and inflation. So, maybe you can help us by reminding us what percent of your cost structure today is labor and how should we think about it breakdown between cost of goods and SG&A?\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark?\nMark Guinan: Yes. So, Ricky, we've shared in the past pre-pandemic, that about $3 billion of our cost was related to salary and benefits. Obviously with COVID moving around it's hard to cite the precise number with including the COVID testing. So, I think that should give you a pretty good idea of what proportion of our costs a $6 plus billion. Cost base we had prior to the pandemic has made up the labor at somewhere in the 50% range. And then as we said, as we continue to automate that certainly offset some of that, but also we are seeing an increased amount of demand for phlebotomy. So, that is going the other direction. We obviously considered a net benefit because giving access helps us grow our business and certainly makes us more attractive, especially in a world of consumerism. And it's a good thing, but it certainly will drive costs, the labor costs as a percentage of all of all costs in the other direction.\nRicky Goldwasser: And then just a follow-up on the direct-to-consumer point, Steve, you mentioned a soft launch of comprehensive health plan, all that's directed in consumer. Can you just share with us what has been the response to date and maybe some data points about pricing?\nSteve Rusckowski: Sure. So, as I said in my introductory remarks, we have a product that we sold for years to employers called blueprint for wellness. And we offer it to request employees as well. So, it's a fabulous dipstick reading on an annual basis for people to get an indication what's going on with their health. And if we do it year upon year, you've got a good nice trending capability that I found beneficial since I've been here in question, I know many of our employees have as well and many of our customers. So, we're now using that is the product to introduce that through our direct-to-consumer channel request direct. We're very optimistic about the possibility that this has we believe that it has a unique capability that few others provide. And we also believe it's hitting the market at the right time, where many people have not gone to their primary health care providers. And we believe that there's a lot of opportunities now for people to directly engage with us as a consumer to buy this directly from us. As far as pricing marketing share what we're thinking about in terms of pricing, even though this is a soft launch.\nMark Guinan: Yes. So, it's going to be a couple of hundred dollars. And when you look at the individual elements that are contained in here, it's a reasonable price for everything that you get. And I can also tell you that we've gotten a lot of feedback that this score that we give people with really simplifies how to interpret the results is a huge consumer positive. So, a lot of reason to believe that this could get some additional momentum for our consumer business, and we think the pricing is reasonable and we feel that the product we're delivering is something that consumers really find interesting valuable.\nSteve Rusckowski: And just to follow-up on the price, we actually did some market research to understand that the value that this provides to consumers justifies the price that we're pricing it for initially. So, we feel good about value delivered and price charged.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan, Nephron Research. Your line is now open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hey, good morning, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Mark and Shawn. I wanted to continue on the inflation topic, but looked at a different way. If operating costs were to remain elevated, do you think there's an appreciation by payers that the cost of doing business is moving higher? How do you feel about your ability to get price increases? Maybe just talk about recent negotiations.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, but let me start it, Mark, please add. Yes, we've been on this march, as I said in my remarks to continue to demonstrate to our health plan partners, that we continue to deliver value and I believe we make -- we're making tremendous progress. One is that we're picking up access in the number of lives. I mentioned 90% of insured lives are -- we're a network within the United States. And we're happy about the progress of picking some more up this coming year. So, that's moving along. Second, as far as pricing is concerned, we continue to march through our contracts as they are up and renewal. And we have said in earlier calls that we're now very fairly arise and matter of fact, we believe we offer a very affordable price offering to the health plans and their memberships with great quality, great service and very competitive pricing so much so that we're part of these preferred lab networks. So, we're justified, we are getting some modest price increases and we do believe going forward that we can continue to pound that drum. And we are using what other people are using across the United States that in fact, now that we're renting a new inflationary period. Our costs are going up just like yours. And therefore, we need to start talking about modest price increases going forward. So, Mark, you'd like to add anything to that?\nMark Guinan: Yes. So, Jack, I think you appreciate, I'm sure a lot of people do as well that our health plan contracts typically are three to five years. So, it's not as if every health plan contract is up for renegotiation in any window of time. But so we've been socializing PAMA and how that is changing the dynamic and how they can look at the NLA rates and be competent that, that they have competitive rate because they know what the -- that's the market for the independent labs, which we've said is lower than the market, but the market for the independent labs. So, this whole notion of a price below Medicare, which was the historical practice is going away with PAMA. Now, you add inflation as you suggest and it's absolutely part of the conversation we've been having over the last number of months. And I can tell you that although it's not final. There is one national payer that we've been negotiating and it's not final, but it looks like the first price increase we will have gotten from them. And certainly my tenure and I'm sure more than a decade. So, we've been stabilizing as we shared our commercial negotiations to go from a world of price declines every contract extension to getting it more flat. And we actually have shared there's a handful of regional plans where we've got increases over the last couple years and now we have a national contract that I'm very optimistic we're going to get an increase. And so, how much of its inflation, how much of its PAMA, how much of it is our value proposition and seeing that working with us is a benefit for everyone versus training us as a commoditized provider of laboratory results. Can't tell you, but we're in a much better place.\nSteve Rusckowski: Just to remind everyone, our health plan channel business is a significant portion of our revenue every year. But what we've also highlighted, the reason why we do have unit price decreases and our typical assumptions annually is because we have other pressures in our business. We do have break business to physicians, which we call clients and our client business as under price pressure over the past several years. And that has contributed to the price pressure we see. Secondly, as we sell the hospitals and we're doing quite well in the hospital segment, but is price competitive. And then we have other product lines, where we sell our services directly to employers or to insurance companies is price pressure there as well. So, when we talk about our unit price changes, it's not all in the commercial health plan area. There's other area that we have price pressures as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from A.J. Rice, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks, everybody. I'm just trying to maybe ask you a high level question about how the pandemic is maybe impacting your business for the long term. It seems like in the pandemic we've seen people move away from just traditional physician office visits at some level virtual care, other alternative sites to get their primary care. Are you seeing and does that help you or hurt you if people go to these other avenues, which may generate testing volume, do you think you capture a disproportionate share of that? And then the other thing, I was going to ask you about the pandemic was related to the -- you've said that if you have outperformance because of COVID testing, you accelerated some of your programs for cost savings and other efficiencies. Should we think of that as just enhancing the visibility on the 3% cost reduction annual goal? Or are there things you're doing that might even present some upside to 2022 and beyond?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So, thanks A.J. for your question. Let me take the first one, I'll ask Mark to comment on the second part of your question. First of all, telehealth as we all know has really increased considerably during the pandemic and it has really hit an inflection pouring in in-patients and consumers are now very comfortable with getting a portion of their healthcare delivered through telehealth networks, whatever that might be. And as we have watched it initially, a lot of the telehealth visits started with mental health and behavioral health and have now transitioned to more general health and primary care and even specialized care. So, with all those visits happening in telehealth, you have to engage with the patient and have to be able to enter orders. And unfortunately for us, despite the pandemic and before the pandemic, we have strong relationships with all the telehealth companies. And as you would expect, they're only going to work for us with a small group of laboratories. And question would be one of those laboratories. So, we're very well positioned with the telehealth providers, but you also know that even though there are telehealth companies, telehealth is provided through integrated delivery systems, hospital systems in different ways, and they might use one of the telehealth provider platforms, but they're still providing that through their physicians and using their EMR. And so, when they enter the order, it's going to be into the order of the same way as in the past. So, we're watching it carefully. We do believe it's as a positive trend for us given what I just described, but it's complicated because it all depends how telehealth platforms are deployed in particularly with so many on physicians, by integrated delivery systems. And they're still conducting the business as they do. It all depends how they actually implement their telehealth services throughout their network and how that will affect our business. But again, for us, we believe it is a positive. So Mark, do you want to take the second part?\nMark Guinan: Yes, actually, A.J. could you repeat that the second part?\nSteve Rusckowski: It had to do it accelerating our drive program because of our enhanced performance. And I think he's speaking to some of the acceleration and capital purchases that we've made and spending some additional money to get more improvements than what we would have realized if we didn't have the pandemic. A.J. is that a correct\u2026\nA.J. Rice: Still there -- \nMark Guinan: Yes. So, we have had an opportunity to invest more than we probably would have otherwise given the stronger growth than we would have anticipated in 2021. We've talked about that. A lot of that investment has actually been more towards top line acceleration. So, we've talked about, what we're doing in advanced diagnostics, we talked about what we're doing, what requires to build a consumer business. So, I'd say a disproportionate amount of the opportunity, as we try to balance near term results with longer-term, value accretion has really been in top line. But yes, as we looked at some of the things we did during the pandemic, we have an opportunity to update our molecular equipment and into more efficient \u2013 into more state-of-the-art, probably faster than we normally would have cycled. So, that'll give us some efficiency that maybe wouldn't have otherwise. So, I wouldn't -- at this point suggest that we're ready to commit to more than the 3% productivity, because obviously that's the large number of unit of itself and small basis points changes are really significant. But directionally, I would say, yes, A.J., this pandemic goal was of value accretion in additional cash has enabled us to accelerate some investments. Most of it on the top line growth, but certainly some on the productivity side as well.\nOperator: Next up is Ann Hynes, Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.\nAnn Hynes: Hi, good morning. So, I just want to talk about the base volume trends. I know revenue was up versus 2019, but can you give us some color on how much your based volume trends are still down versus pre-pandemic, maybe ex some of the PLS deals that you've signed during the pandemic, and if it's still down maybe just to give a geographic breakdown and I guess my second question would be obviously testing was a very strong for molecular PCR test for COVID-19. Can you give us a breakdown, how much of that was contributed to like this back to life initiative, whether it's schools, cities, states more like maintenance testing, and I know you said in your prepared remarks that you assume revenue per test goes down in Q4. Can you give us what it was in Q3 and maybe just directionally what we should model for Q4? That would be very helpful. Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Okay. Thanks, Ann. Mark, why don't you just start with giving the numbers on base business performance system there.\nMark Guinan: Yes. So, hopefully, I can clarify, base volume in total is obviously anything on COVID-related as we've been through the pandemic, we've been recording strong growth in base volume, which includes our M&A and our PLS, as you would expect. But we've also been trying to provide some color on utilization, in the absence of independence way to measure that. We look at our base volume ex, the acquired volume and facts the new PLS deals. And we've talked about that continuing to improve in addition to the growth we're getting from M&A and from PLS. So, in June, the organic base volumes and the new PLS deal was getting close to back to the 2019 levels. And then it kind of stabilized in August \u2013 in July, and it took a little bit of a step in August. And then as we see where we are through September and into October, it's getting back again, very close to being fully recovered in 2019. And that's why I said earlier that we would expect certainly by the end of this year and going into '22, that we'd be fully recovered. Now, it is regionally, very variable as we've talked in the past, and that really has not changed. There are certain regions that are actually above where they were in 2019, most notably our Southwest region, as we're looking at Florida in the south, the volume trends are above, and then a couple other areas that are kind of in that middle point. And then the one area of note that's really been lagging is the east, and it continues to lag while it certainly has improved from where it was several months ago. It's still down and kind of an outlier especially in the five boroughs of New York City. And then quickly, I'll answer the question on the revenue expectations for molecular testing, and I'll let Steve talk about the back to life. So, we're still around $90 in the quarter. We're not expecting a meaningful decline in the fourth quarter. Certainly, if back to life really, really took off, which is not, what we're expecting in the middle of our guidance here, it could have a little bit of a row, but again, it's still net positive. It's just math. So, you can expect for your modeling purposes, that just a very, very slight decline in Q4, nothing of significance.\nSteve Rusckowski: And the last question Ann, you had asked for the breakdown of what we describe is, first of all, the clinical portion of our PCR volumes versus return to life portion of our clinical volumes. And as you can expect, it's tough for us to know exactly particularly, which bucket we can put those in. But I can tell you that the trend line is trending towards more of the return to life. We see the infection rates coming down and we see programs that we've worked on going up, examples are the return to school programs, we mentioned 20 states and five more coming. We also doing some testing for employers if they have mandates in place where they're requiring vaccination or testing. So, we'll see some increase in testing related to again, employers bringing people back to the workplace and requiring testing or vaccination for that. So, I would say trending wise, it is a larger percentage than before, but it's very difficult for us to give you exact numbers on that because we just don't get it through the orders that we received. But we think what we've provided for guidance is clearly what's going to happen in '22.\nOperator: Next up is Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is now open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Hey, good morning. Thanks. First, just a quick follow-up on a comment you made, can you give us a sense of how much flu testing you do a year, if that's what you're anchoring for baseline COVID testing going forward. And then separately, I was just hoping you could talk about COVID reimbursement and the outlook of that for next year? Obviously, you mentioned PHG got extended at least for the early part of next year, if that continues to expand, if you expect reimbursement to be better than what you assumed in that $8 EPS for next year? And then also, what about commercial pricing specifically for COVID is that that tied to PHG? Or help us understand sort of how that's negotiated and if there's a step down there for next year? Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark, do you want start with the flu?\nMark Guinan: Yes. So, it was quite a bit there, Ralph, we'll see if we can touch on all of them. So, we don't generally share the precise revenue for any given test offering, but it's significantly lower than our current levels of COVID and what we would anticipate. So, the flu is not the baseline for 2022. We still expect COVID testing to be multiples of our fleet revenues in 2022. And the reason flu testing is smaller than what the otherwise is. There's not a ton of molecular testing done. Physicians have become very comfortable with doing point of care. And even though the molecular is more precise, they feel that it gets good enough in the office and they have an opportunity to make money on it. So, I would probably be several years, although I don't have the ability to call it precisely before we would expect COVID to be at our flu level. And then in terms of the pricing we have either specific agreements or general agreements that as long as in the commercial rates, that as long as the federal health emergency continues, that the pricing will reflect what we're being paid by the federal government. So, it's not mechanistically tied to every contract, but we know that the expectation would be when that goes away. And again, there's still always a possibility they can decouple that $100 reimbursement rates from the health emergency. So, there's some other risks as well, but as long as that continues, we would expect most of our commercial pricing to be at the same rate. And then, obviously, when that goes away, that we would expect a negotiations to take it down to more the NLA level. So, when I talked about 2022 at the Investor Day, I talked about a reimbursement rate around $50, which is what the NLA is. And so, again, when you put all these pieces together, I want to be clear, we still fully expect to be in the upper end of that $7.40 and $8. I just wanted to caution against upside to that given everything that's going on with inflation and so on, because we do have some positive things that have developed over the last six months or so. And some of that is probably going to be partially offset if not largely offset by labor inflation. So, we're still pretty much where we were back in March. So, in the higher end of the $748, and then certainly at least $8.5 billion of revenue, which importantly ties back to the 2018 CAGR that we've shared with you at Investor Day, and so, just getting there in a little different way, but still getting to where we said we would be.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matt Larew, William Blair. Your line is now open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Good Morning, Matt.\nMatt Larew: Yes. Hi, good morning. So, a number of questions around labor issues, I actually want to ask about supply chain. I'm just curious if you're starting to see any challenges in sourcing anything, either for your PSCs or the labs, either longer lead times, and then if you're having any issues with the sample transport logistics?\nSteve Rusckowski: Well, so far Matt we're keeping up, we always have battles here and there, even despite the pandemic with supplies got a complicated business and a lot of pieces have to come together to do what we do, but not a meaningful disruption so far, but we're watching it carefully because we're not through this yet. So, the last part of this is around logistics and again, logistics have become a little more complicated given we do use commercial carriers for some portion of our logistics, but we've been managing our way through that. Fortunately, we have our own network of carriers. We have about 3,500 carriers and automobiles that are request employees. We have a fleet of small airplanes through some of the connections between our collection locations and our laboratories and they're employed by us. And so we're happy we had those in these uncertain times and we continue to have strong relationships with the national carriers as well, so far so good.\nOperator: Next up is Pito Chickering, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Peter.\nPito Chickering: Hi, good morning guys. I follow-up on Ann's question around the base testing business, once you exclude M&A and POS, can you give us color on where the tests are coming in from specifically looking at primary care visits versus specialty visit versus hospital visits? Just curious if hospitals slowdown in fourth quarter with the COVID surge, does it impact anything on your fourth quarter growth?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So, first off, Pito to be clear, the utilization trend that I talked about being nearly fully recovery doesn't exclude all POS, it just since we're comparing to 2019, it's excluding some of the really large deals that we've done recently. So, that we don't cloud what we think utilization is. So, we had a PLS business of size back in 2019. I'm not taking that out, because obviously, that's part of the trend as well. So, when you look at the sources, we've shared that -- the recovery has been pretty broad based. There's not a lot of differences especially now, early in the pandemic there were some we talked about for certain drug monitoring, certainly being one that was lagging. A lot of that was policy driven, a lot -- some of that, not all of it, but a lot of it's been addressed and certainly we've seen the toxicology or prescription drug monitoring business coming back in the same ballpark as some of our other clinical areas. We did see hospitals recovering faster early in the pandemic as a return to trading patients for elective surgeries and so on, physician office was a little more lagging, but at this point, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, the physician business is quite strong and we're seeing the volumes especially in some of the regions above where they were in 2019. So, we don't feel other than the east that there's been any sort of a fundamental change in either patient engagement with physician offices and or the prescribing practices for our diagnostics business specifically.\nOperator: Next up is Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Tycho.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Casey on for Tycho. Two quick ones for you guys, the first one, do you think that the increased cash spent per requisition or test density trends that you've called out in 2021 will continue into 2022. And is that baked into that $7.40 to $8 EPS outlook. And then my second one is just on capital deployment. You guys have completed the ASR, right? So should we expect any more buybacks in 4Q and what share account should we use for our model for 4Q? Thank you.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, I'll take the first one. Mark, you take the second and versus on rec density that is the number of tests per requisition. We assume there's a lot of different moving parts as you know for our business. One of which is the mix of tests. The second is number of tests for requisition being able to we have channel mix changes. So, all of that is complicated in our outlook that we've provided. So, we assume that that's in there. And Mark, you want to talk about capital deployment question?\nMark Guinan: Sure. So, the ASR should be wrapped up sometime in the next 30 days. So, therefore for at this point, even we did additional purchases once the window opens and not committing to anything at this point, because we always say there's a balance between potential M&A and share repurchases. It wouldn't have a significant impact on our way so this year. So, any sort of additional purchases of our shares repurchases would be more of an impact for 2022. And obviously, we'll talk about that in detail when we come up to the guidance for 2022 early next year.\nOperator: Next up is Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Good morning, Derik.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is   on for Derek. I wanted to dig into the base business growth specifically within your advanced diagnostic business. Was there any notable trend for cancer and genetic testing, if you could comment on the growth trajectory that'd be great?\nSteve Rusckowski: John, in our remarks, we're pleased with the recovery we've seen in advanced diagnostics and remind everyone that our definition of advanced diagnostics are entirely molecular and genetics. And when I say recovery and I did say molecular, it does not include our COVID testing. So, it's our base, if you will, molecular and genetic testing. And we saw very good growth in beyond recovery for our prenatal testing feel good about that. And we are seeing nice growth for our genetics business. And as you recall, we did an acquisition with blueprint genetics last year, and that's progressing nicely and give us some nice growth and strength in that business. So, we feel good about the recovery and growth we're seeing in those areas that we're really focused on and genetics in general is one of those areas.\nOperator: Next up is Mike Newshel, Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hey Mike.\nMike Newshel: Hey, thanks. So, do -- there's a labor and inflation costs issues you have talked about that you can absorb in your 2022 outlook. Does that have any change in the long-term sort of growth targets that you laid out for post 2022 in terms of earnings growth?\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark?\nMark Guinan: Yes. So, I -- at this point, obviously we have a broad range, but I would say that just like we've done in other periods of time. We'll look for and identify offsets to that. So, I -- it's not significant enough that we should deviate on a multi-year outlook in terms of our earnings growth being in the high-single digits, and we -- although we have identified everything over the next several years. I'm sure as we move through time we'll look for other productivity opportunities to offset some of that.\nOperator: There are no more questions.\nSteve Rusckowski: Okay, very good. So, thanks to everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate your continued support and everyone have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call.

            "name": "Steve Rusckowski",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we had a strong third quarter as COVID-19 molecular volumes increased throughout the summer, while our base business continue to deliver solid volume growth versus the prior year, and 2019. In late summer, we experienced some softness in the base business across the country, but saw a rebound, in September. Importantly, our base business continues to improve sequentially in the third quarter, which speaks to the ongoing recovery. We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher-then-anticipated COVID-19 volumes, as well as continued progress we expect to see in our base business, despite rising labor costs and inflationary pressures. The momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day. So, this morning, I'll discuss our performance for the third quarter of 2021, and update you on our base business. And then Mark will provide more detail on our financial results, and talk about our updated outlook and underlying assumptions. But before turning to our results in the third quarter, I'd like to update you on the progress we've made in our quest for health equity initiative, a more than $100 million initiative aimed at reducing healthcare disparities in underserved neighborhoods. Since we've established it, just over a year ago, we have launched 18 programs across the United States and Puerto Rico, ranging from supporting COVID-19 testing and vaccination events to educating young students on healthy nutritional choices, to providing funding support for a long-haul COVID-19 clinic in Puerto Rico. Recently, we announced the collaboration with the American Heart Association that will expand research and mentorship opportunities for black and Hispanic scholars to drive hypertension management and COVID-19 relief. We're off to a good start, and I look forward to updating you on our continued progress as Quest for Health Equity enters its second year. Now, turning to our results for the third quarter, total revenue of $2.77 billion, down 40 basis points versus the prior year; earnings per share were $4.02 on a reported basis, down approximately 3% versus the prior year; and $3.96 on an adjusted basis, down 8% versus the prior year. The revenue and earnings declines in the third quarter reflect lower COVID-19 testing in 2021 versus the prior year, partially offset by continued recovery in our base business. Cash provided by operations increased by nearly 20% year-to-date through September, to approximately $1.75 billion. Now, starting with COVID-19 testing, our COVID-19 molecular volumes increased in the third quarter versus the second quarter, due to the spread of the Delta variant over the course of the summer. Testing began to increase meaningfully in mid-July, and peaked in early mid-September. Our observed positivity rate peaked in mid-August, and has steadily been declining across much of the country in recent weeks. We performed an average of 83,000 COVID-19 molecular tests a day in the third quarter, and maintained strong average turnaround times of approximately one day for most specimens throughout the surge. As clinical COVID-19 volumes declined, we are expanding our non-clinical COVID-19 testing to support the return to school, office, travel, and entertainment. We're making testing easy, fast, and affordable for school systems and other group settings across the country. We are currently performing K-12 school testing in approximately 20 states, with five additional states ready to come online. We're testing passengers on   cruise lines, and Quest exclusively provided testing at the Boston Marathon earlier this month. In the base business, we continue to make progress on our two-point strategy to accelerate growth, and drive operational excellence. Now, here are some highlights from the third quarter. Our M&A pipeline remained strong. In the third quarter, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition of an independent lab in Florida. We continue to build on our exceptional health plan access of approximately 90% of all commercially insured lives in the United States. At our Investor Day, we discussed how we have fundamentally changed our relationship with health plans, and we continue to see the promise of value-based relationships come to life. So, here's a couple examples. We are working with national health plans to help their self-insured employers -- employer customers improve quality, outcomes, and lower the cost of care for both the employers and their employees. Also, effective October 1, we gained access to one million managed Medicaid members, in Florida, as their coverage transitions to  Sunshine Health Plan. We're getting good feedback from the provider community and our growing testing volumes through this expanded access opportunity. Our hospital health system revenue continues to track well above 2019 levels, driven largely by the strength of our professional laboratory services contracts. As we highlighted previously, 2021 performance is benefiting from two of our largest POS contracts to date, Hackensack Meridian Health, and Memorial Hermann. Altogether, our POS business is expected to exceed $500 million in annual revenue this year. Trends in our hospital reference business also remained steady, with third quarter base testing volumes above 2019 levels. We also generated consumer-initiated testing revenue through QuestDirect in the third quarter. While COVID testing has been strong contributor to growth, we expect our base direct-to-consumer testing to more than double this year. Recently, we soft-launched a comprehensive health profile on QuestDirect, similar to our Blueprint for Wellness offering for employers. This expanded health plan -- panel offers a deep dive into consumers' health profile with a battery of tests and biometric measurements to provide a personalized health quotient score that can be used to track health progress over time. And then finally, our MyQuest app and patient portal now has almost 20 million users. In advanced diagnostics, we continue to ramp investments and see strong momentum in key growth drivers. We're seeing growth in non-evasive prenatal testing significantly above 2019 levels, and saw solid contribution in our specialty genetics portfolio from Blueprint Genetics. We continue to work closely with the CDC to sequence positive COVID specimens in an ongoing effort to track emergent variants, expanding all of the work that we performed in the quarter. And then finally, we plan to introduce a test service based on a new FDA-approved companion diagnostic   for a therapy from Eli Lilly for a certain type of high-risk early breast cancer. Quest will be the first laboratory to offer it to physicians, nationally, at the end of the month. Turning to our second strategy, driving operational excellence, we made progress and remain on track to deliver on our targeted 3% annual efficiencies across the business. Last week, we announced that we completed the integration and consolidation of our northeast regional operations into our new 250,000 square-foot next-generation lab, in Clifton, New Jersey. This state-of-the-art highly automated facility services, more than 40 million people across seven states. In patient services, we are seeing all time high numbers of patients making appointments to visit our Patient Service Centers. Now more than 50% of patient service center visits are now by the appointment versus walk-ins. And this enables patients to be very satisfied and also improves our ability to drive productivity for our Phlebotomist. Similar to our immunoassay platform consolidation, we recently procured a highly automated neuro analysis platform that is expected to generate millions in annual savings, once these new systems are standardized across our laboratory network. And then finally, I'd like to recognize and thank all of our nearly 50,000 employees who have worked tirelessly to provide critical COVID-19 testing to our country throughout the pandemic, and continue to serve the healthcare needs of patients who depend on Quest every day. As a demonstration of our gratitude, we're assisting our employees with a one-time payment of up to $500 designed to reimburse costs, they incurred during the pandemic. Additionally, another year of pandemic pressures and travel restrictions have made it very difficult for many employees to take their hard earned time off. Therefore, we're providing a payout of most unused paid time off for our hourly employees to ensure they don't forfeit their earned unused time at year end. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, to provide more details on the third quarter financial performance and updated outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mark? Thanks, Mark. Well, to summarize, we had a strong third quarter. We have raised our outlook for the remainder of the year based on higher-than-anticipated COVID-19 volumes, as well as our continued progress we expect to see in our base business. And finally, the momentum of our base business positions us to deliver the 2022 outlook we shared at our March Investor Day. So, now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Good morning, Kevin. Mark, why don't you start, and then I'll follow. Yes, so, thanks, Brian, for the question. So, as you know, and what I reiterated in our prepared remarks, we've been marching with our two-point strategy for some time. And the second strategy is to drive operational excellence, and we have maintained, and just reiterated, that we do believe we can continue to deliver 3% efficiency or productivity gains going forward. And that 3% comes from a variety of programs across Quest Diagnostics, and one of which is what we did in Clifton. And I actually also reiterated a couple other programs on the prepared remarks, are working with our suppliers with new integrated platforms, what we're done around immunoassay, what we're doing around our   analysis is -- are two good examples of more work we can get the benefits from, and there's others. So, there's a lot more efficiencies in productivity we can continue to get. And as I said before, this isn't cost-cutting, this is improvement. And so, every time we make an improvement in our operation we expect our quality improves, and our service performance improves, and it has. So, we continue to make progress. You see it in our numbers this year, and you'll continue to see it in our '22 numbers as well. And that's always been used to offset headwinds, and we do have headwinds, we've had headwinds from wage bill increases in the past, albeit maybe it could be a little bit higher going forward, given what we see in the labor market. And then second is, we have seen headwinds from price consequences as well, which we've been able to offset, and we'll have some of those in '22 as we've outlined before. And then, also any additional inflationary pressures, we will be able to offset most of that, if not all of that, to be able to hit the outlook, and we just reiterated our confidence, our ability to do that. So, hopefully that's helpful. Good morning, Ricky. Mark? Sure. So, as I said in my introductory remarks, we have a product that we sold for years to employers called blueprint for wellness. And we offer it to request employees as well. So, it's a fabulous dipstick reading on an annual basis for people to get an indication what's going on with their health. And if we do it year upon year, you've got a good nice trending capability that I found beneficial since I've been here in question, I know many of our employees have as well and many of our customers. So, we're now using that is the product to introduce that through our direct-to-consumer channel request direct. We're very optimistic about the possibility that this has we believe that it has a unique capability that few others provide. And we also believe it's hitting the market at the right time, where many people have not gone to their primary health care providers. And we believe that there's a lot of opportunities now for people to directly engage with us as a consumer to buy this directly from us. As far as pricing marketing share what we're thinking about in terms of pricing, even though this is a soft launch. And just to follow-up on the price, we actually did some market research to understand that the value that this provides to consumers justifies the price that we're pricing it for initially. So, we feel good about value delivered and price charged. Hey, good morning, Jack. Yes, but let me start it, Mark, please add. Yes, we've been on this march, as I said in my remarks to continue to demonstrate to our health plan partners, that we continue to deliver value and I believe we make -- we're making tremendous progress. One is that we're picking up access in the number of lives. I mentioned 90% of insured lives are -- we're a network within the United States. And we're happy about the progress of picking some more up this coming year. So, that's moving along. Second, as far as pricing is concerned, we continue to march through our contracts as they are up and renewal. And we have said in earlier calls that we're now very fairly arise and matter of fact, we believe we offer a very affordable price offering to the health plans and their memberships with great quality, great service and very competitive pricing so much so that we're part of these preferred lab networks. So, we're justified, we are getting some modest price increases and we do believe going forward that we can continue to pound that drum. And we are using what other people are using across the United States that in fact, now that we're renting a new inflationary period. Our costs are going up just like yours. And therefore, we need to start talking about modest price increases going forward. So, Mark, you'd like to add anything to that? Just to remind everyone, our health plan channel business is a significant portion of our revenue every year. But what we've also highlighted, the reason why we do have unit price decreases and our typical assumptions annually is because we have other pressures in our business. We do have break business to physicians, which we call clients and our client business as under price pressure over the past several years. And that has contributed to the price pressure we see. Secondly, as we sell the hospitals and we're doing quite well in the hospital segment, but is price competitive. And then we have other product lines, where we sell our services directly to employers or to insurance companies is price pressure there as well. So, when we talk about our unit price changes, it's not all in the commercial health plan area. There's other area that we have price pressures as well. Yes. So, thanks A.J. for your question. Let me take the first one, I'll ask Mark to comment on the second part of your question. First of all, telehealth as we all know has really increased considerably during the pandemic and it has really hit an inflection pouring in in-patients and consumers are now very comfortable with getting a portion of their healthcare delivered through telehealth networks, whatever that might be. And as we have watched it initially, a lot of the telehealth visits started with mental health and behavioral health and have now transitioned to more general health and primary care and even specialized care. So, with all those visits happening in telehealth, you have to engage with the patient and have to be able to enter orders. And unfortunately for us, despite the pandemic and before the pandemic, we have strong relationships with all the telehealth companies. And as you would expect, they're only going to work for us with a small group of laboratories. And question would be one of those laboratories. So, we're very well positioned with the telehealth providers, but you also know that even though there are telehealth companies, telehealth is provided through integrated delivery systems, hospital systems in different ways, and they might use one of the telehealth provider platforms, but they're still providing that through their physicians and using their EMR. And so, when they enter the order, it's going to be into the order of the same way as in the past. So, we're watching it carefully. We do believe it's as a positive trend for us given what I just described, but it's complicated because it all depends how telehealth platforms are deployed in particularly with so many on physicians, by integrated delivery systems. And they're still conducting the business as they do. It all depends how they actually implement their telehealth services throughout their network and how that will affect our business. But again, for us, we believe it is a positive. So Mark, do you want to take the second part? It had to do it accelerating our drive program because of our enhanced performance. And I think he's speaking to some of the acceleration and capital purchases that we've made and spending some additional money to get more improvements than what we would have realized if we didn't have the pandemic. A.J. is that a correct... Okay. Thanks, Ann. Mark, why don't you just start with giving the numbers on base business performance system there. And the last question Ann, you had asked for the breakdown of what we describe is, first of all, the clinical portion of our PCR volumes versus return to life portion of our clinical volumes. And as you can expect, it's tough for us to know exactly particularly, which bucket we can put those in. But I can tell you that the trend line is trending towards more of the return to life. We see the infection rates coming down and we see programs that we've worked on going up, examples are the return to school programs, we mentioned 20 states and five more coming. We also doing some testing for employers if they have mandates in place where they're requiring vaccination or testing. So, we'll see some increase in testing related to again, employers bringing people back to the workplace and requiring testing or vaccination for that. So, I would say trending wise, it is a larger percentage than before, but it's very difficult for us to give you exact numbers on that because we just don't get it through the orders that we received. But we think what we've provided for guidance is clearly what's going to happen in '22. Mark, do you want start with the flu? Good Morning, Matt. Well, so far Matt we're keeping up, we always have battles here and there, even despite the pandemic with supplies got a complicated business and a lot of pieces have to come together to do what we do, but not a meaningful disruption so far, but we're watching it carefully because we're not through this yet. So, the last part of this is around logistics and again, logistics have become a little more complicated given we do use commercial carriers for some portion of our logistics, but we've been managing our way through that. Fortunately, we have our own network of carriers. We have about 3,500 carriers and automobiles that are request employees. We have a fleet of small airplanes through some of the connections between our collection locations and our laboratories and they're employed by us. And so we're happy we had those in these uncertain times and we continue to have strong relationships with the national carriers as well, so far so good. Hi, Peter. Yes. So, first off, Pito to be clear, the utilization trend that I talked about being nearly fully recovery doesn't exclude all POS, it just since we're comparing to 2019, it's excluding some of the really large deals that we've done recently. So, that we don't cloud what we think utilization is. So, we had a PLS business of size back in 2019. I'm not taking that out, because obviously, that's part of the trend as well. So, when you look at the sources, we've shared that -- the recovery has been pretty broad based. There's not a lot of differences especially now, early in the pandemic there were some we talked about for certain drug monitoring, certainly being one that was lagging. A lot of that was policy driven, a lot -- some of that, not all of it, but a lot of it's been addressed and certainly we've seen the toxicology or prescription drug monitoring business coming back in the same ballpark as some of our other clinical areas. We did see hospitals recovering faster early in the pandemic as a return to trading patients for elective surgeries and so on, physician office was a little more lagging, but at this point, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, the physician business is quite strong and we're seeing the volumes especially in some of the regions above where they were in 2019. So, we don't feel other than the east that there's been any sort of a fundamental change in either patient engagement with physician offices and or the prescribing practices for our diagnostics business specifically. Hi, Tycho. Yes, I'll take the first one. Mark, you take the second and versus on rec density that is the number of tests per requisition. We assume there's a lot of different moving parts as you know for our business. One of which is the mix of tests. The second is number of tests for requisition being able to we have channel mix changes. So, all of that is complicated in our outlook that we've provided. So, we assume that that's in there. And Mark, you want to talk about capital deployment question? Good morning, Derik. John, in our remarks, we're pleased with the recovery we've seen in advanced diagnostics and remind everyone that our definition of advanced diagnostics are entirely molecular and genetics. And when I say recovery and I did say molecular, it does not include our COVID testing. So, it's our base, if you will, molecular and genetic testing. And we saw very good growth in beyond recovery for our prenatal testing feel good about that. And we are seeing nice growth for our genetics business. And as you recall, we did an acquisition with blueprint genetics last year, and that's progressing nicely and give us some nice growth and strength in that business. So, we feel good about the recovery and growth we're seeing in those areas that we're really focused on and genetics in general is one of those areas. Hey Mike. Mark? Okay, very good. So, thanks to everyone for joining our call today. We appreciate your continued support and everyone have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.77 billion, down 0.4% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were essentially flat when compared to the prior year, which is reflected by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the third quarter of last year, largely offset by the strong ongoing recovery in our base testing revenue. Compared to 2019, our base DIS revenue grew approximately 6% in the third quarter, and it was up nearly 2%, excluding acquisitions. Volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 5.3% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 2%. Compared to our third quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 9%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 4% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped over the last year. We saw a rebound in our base business volumes in September, following a modest softening in August that we believe was at least partially caused by the rise of the delta variance and the timing of summer vacations. Importantly, our base business revenue and volume grew sequentially in the third quarter. This helps illustrate the ongoing recovery as historically total revenue and volume typically stepped down in Q3 versus Q2 due to summer seasonality. As most of you know, COVID-19 testing volumes grew in the third quarter versus Q2, which was in line with broader COVID-19 testing trends across the country. We resulted approximately 7.6 million molecular tests and nearly 700,000 serology tests in the third quarter. So, far in October, average COVID-19 molecular volumes have declined approximately 10% from where we exited Q3, but are still above the levels we expected prior to the surge of the delta variance, while the base business continues to improve since September. Revenue per requisition declined 5.4% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume and to a lesser extent recent PLS wins. Unit price headwinds remained modest and in line with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $652 million or 23.5% of revenues compared to $718 million or 25.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income in Q3 was $694 million or 25% of revenues, compared to $831 million or 29.8% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was driven by lower COVID-19 testing revenue, partially offset by the recovery in our base business. Reported EPS was $4.02 in the quarter, compared to $4.14 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.96, compared to $4.31 last year. Cash provided by operations was $1.75 billion through September, year-to-date, versus $1.46 billion in the same period last year. Turning to guidance, we have raised our full-year 2021 outlook as follows. Revenue is expected to between $10.45 and $10.6 billion, an increase of approximately 11% to 12% versus the prior year. Reported EPS expected to be in the range of $4.69 and $15.09, and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $13.50 and $13.90. Cash provided by operations is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated outlook. We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to continue to decline from Q3 levels throughout the remainder of the year. At the low end of our outlook, we assume approximately 50,000 molecular tests per day in Q4, and serology volumes to hold relatively steady at approximately 5,000 tests per day. As you may know, late last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days, through late January. We expect reimbursements of clinical COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the remainder of the year. However, we continue to assume average reimbursements to trend lower in Q4 as our mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes potentially shift from clinical diagnostic testing to more return-to-life surveillance testing. Finally, we continue to assume low single-digit revenue growth in our base business in Q4, versus 2019. Getting to the midpoint or higher end of our outlook ranges assumes stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and/or stronger growth in our base business. I will now turn it back to Steve. Sure. And, Kevin, just to be clear upfront, we haven't provided guidance yet for 2022; we provided an outlook. And we did confirm that today. And things have largely played out where we saw them for 2022, back in March, and base volumes have recovered. And we thought we were ahead in June, when it was close to being flat to 2019, and potentially saw some upside, obviously, with Delta, it's -- it took a little bit of a step back. But we still expect to enter 2022 with a base volume utilization level similar to pre-pandemic, so that's good. The second thing is we did assume that COVID will continue at a much lower level than we saw in '20 and '21, but still to be significant, and certainly much larger than our current flu testing. And we've referenced, in the past, that at some point COVID testing will still be here, but maybe more on the level of flu testing. At this point, we feel comfortable with what we had assumed, back in March, around continued need for COVID testing for PCR. And we envision a stronger role for serology going into 2022, and think that's a potential. So, we feel good about that. And then, we did reference inflationary pressures. We certainly have longer-term contracts on a lot of our purchases, but things, like fuel, certainly were subject to inflation in the near-term and going into 2022. And then most notably, as many have talked, there's certainly inflation in wages and in benefits, and especially in wages. And that, as we look at that, we gave a range, and we still feel very comfortable that when you put all those pieces together, that the $8.5 billion baseline for revenue and the $7.40 to $8.00 is certainly still deliverable, maybe in slightly different way, and -- but still very comfortable, that that's likely where we're going to land when we do finally provide guidance for 2022. Yes. So, I'm sure you're most interested in 2022, so, we'll see what we can provide when we come out with guidance, in early next year, to provide clarity. Certainly at this point, well, we're experiencing some of that given the performance of the business; it hasn't prevented us from significantly over-delivering our previous guidance. So, we'll take a note of consideration, Kevin. We appreciate the question. We'll see what we can do when we talk more about next year. Yes, I just wanted to add a reference that the Clifton lab and its increased productivity efficiency is really part of our invigorate work that we talk about 3% productivity every year. It's not over and above or separate whatever  common is that what we've done there like we did up in Massachusetts. We have added more automation. Obviously, as you add automation, you insulate yourself a little bit from labor inflation. So, certainly, we have that going as we operate that lab, but it is built-in, and part of what my assumptions I had putting together that outlook for 2022 that we would achieve that ongoing 3% efficiency is not something specially... Yes. So, Ricky, we've shared in the past pre-pandemic, that about $3 billion of our cost was related to salary and benefits. Obviously with COVID moving around it's hard to cite the precise number with including the COVID testing. So, I think that should give you a pretty good idea of what proportion of our costs a $6 plus billion. Cost base we had prior to the pandemic has made up the labor at somewhere in the 50% range. And then as we said, as we continue to automate that certainly offset some of that, but also we are seeing an increased amount of demand for phlebotomy. So, that is going the other direction. We obviously considered a net benefit because giving access helps us grow our business and certainly makes us more attractive, especially in a world of consumerism. And it's a good thing, but it certainly will drive costs, the labor costs as a percentage of all of all costs in the other direction. Yes. So, it's going to be a couple of hundred dollars. And when you look at the individual elements that are contained in here, it's a reasonable price for everything that you get. And I can also tell you that we've gotten a lot of feedback that this score that we give people with really simplifies how to interpret the results is a huge consumer positive. So, a lot of reason to believe that this could get some additional momentum for our consumer business, and we think the pricing is reasonable and we feel that the product we're delivering is something that consumers really find interesting valuable. Yes. So, Jack, I think you appreciate, I'm sure a lot of people do as well that our health plan contracts typically are three to five years. So, it's not as if every health plan contract is up for renegotiation in any window of time. But so we've been socializing PAMA and how that is changing the dynamic and how they can look at the NLA rates and be competent that, that they have competitive rate because they know what the -- that's the market for the independent labs, which we've said is lower than the market, but the market for the independent labs. So, this whole notion of a price below Medicare, which was the historical practice is going away with PAMA. Now, you add inflation as you suggest and it's absolutely part of the conversation we've been having over the last number of months. And I can tell you that although it's not final. There is one national payer that we've been negotiating and it's not final, but it looks like the first price increase we will have gotten from them. And certainly my tenure and I'm sure more than a decade. So, we've been stabilizing as we shared our commercial negotiations to go from a world of price declines every contract extension to getting it more flat. And we actually have shared there's a handful of regional plans where we've got increases over the last couple years and now we have a national contract that I'm very optimistic we're going to get an increase. And so, how much of its inflation, how much of its PAMA, how much of it is our value proposition and seeing that working with us is a benefit for everyone versus training us as a commoditized provider of laboratory results. Can't tell you, but we're in a much better place. Yes, actually, A.J. could you repeat that the second part? Yes. So, we have had an opportunity to invest more than we probably would have otherwise given the stronger growth than we would have anticipated in 2021. We've talked about that. A lot of that investment has actually been more towards top line acceleration. So, we've talked about, what we're doing in advanced diagnostics, we talked about what we're doing, what requires to build a consumer business. So, I'd say a disproportionate amount of the opportunity, as we try to balance near term results with longer-term, value accretion has really been in top line. But yes, as we looked at some of the things we did during the pandemic, we have an opportunity to update our molecular equipment and into more efficient \u2013 into more state-of-the-art, probably faster than we normally would have cycled. So, that'll give us some efficiency that maybe wouldn't have otherwise. So, I wouldn't -- at this point suggest that we're ready to commit to more than the 3% productivity, because obviously that's the large number of unit of itself and small basis points changes are really significant. But directionally, I would say, yes, A.J., this pandemic goal was of value accretion in additional cash has enabled us to accelerate some investments. Most of it on the top line growth, but certainly some on the productivity side as well. Yes. So, hopefully, I can clarify, base volume in total is obviously anything on COVID-related as we've been through the pandemic, we've been recording strong growth in base volume, which includes our M&A and our PLS, as you would expect. But we've also been trying to provide some color on utilization, in the absence of independence way to measure that. We look at our base volume ex, the acquired volume and facts the new PLS deals. And we've talked about that continuing to improve in addition to the growth we're getting from M&A and from PLS. So, in June, the organic base volumes and the new PLS deal was getting close to back to the 2019 levels. And then it kind of stabilized in August \u2013 in July, and it took a little bit of a step in August. And then as we see where we are through September and into October, it's getting back again, very close to being fully recovered in 2019. And that's why I said earlier that we would expect certainly by the end of this year and going into '22, that we'd be fully recovered. Now, it is regionally, very variable as we've talked in the past, and that really has not changed. There are certain regions that are actually above where they were in 2019, most notably our Southwest region, as we're looking at Florida in the south, the volume trends are above, and then a couple other areas that are kind of in that middle point. And then the one area of note that's really been lagging is the east, and it continues to lag while it certainly has improved from where it was several months ago. It's still down and kind of an outlier especially in the five boroughs of New York City. And then quickly, I'll answer the question on the revenue expectations for molecular testing, and I'll let Steve talk about the back to life. So, we're still around $90 in the quarter. We're not expecting a meaningful decline in the fourth quarter. Certainly, if back to life really, really took off, which is not, what we're expecting in the middle of our guidance here, it could have a little bit of a row, but again, it's still net positive. It's just math. So, you can expect for your modeling purposes, that just a very, very slight decline in Q4, nothing of significance. Yes. So, it was quite a bit there, Ralph, we'll see if we can touch on all of them. So, we don't generally share the precise revenue for any given test offering, but it's significantly lower than our current levels of COVID and what we would anticipate. So, the flu is not the baseline for 2022. We still expect COVID testing to be multiples of our fleet revenues in 2022. And the reason flu testing is smaller than what the otherwise is. There's not a ton of molecular testing done. Physicians have become very comfortable with doing point of care. And even though the molecular is more precise, they feel that it gets good enough in the office and they have an opportunity to make money on it. So, I would probably be several years, although I don't have the ability to call it precisely before we would expect COVID to be at our flu level. And then in terms of the pricing we have either specific agreements or general agreements that as long as in the commercial rates, that as long as the federal health emergency continues, that the pricing will reflect what we're being paid by the federal government. So, it's not mechanistically tied to every contract, but we know that the expectation would be when that goes away. And again, there's still always a possibility they can decouple that $100 reimbursement rates from the health emergency. So, there's some other risks as well, but as long as that continues, we would expect most of our commercial pricing to be at the same rate. And then, obviously, when that goes away, that we would expect a negotiations to take it down to more the NLA level. So, when I talked about 2022 at the Investor Day, I talked about a reimbursement rate around $50, which is what the NLA is. And so, again, when you put all these pieces together, I want to be clear, we still fully expect to be in the upper end of that $7.40 and $8. I just wanted to caution against upside to that given everything that's going on with inflation and so on, because we do have some positive things that have developed over the last six months or so. And some of that is probably going to be partially offset if not largely offset by labor inflation. So, we're still pretty much where we were back in March. So, in the higher end of the $748, and then certainly at least $8.5 billion of revenue, which importantly ties back to the 2018 CAGR that we've shared with you at Investor Day, and so, just getting there in a little different way, but still getting to where we said we would be. Sure. So, the ASR should be wrapped up sometime in the next 30 days. So, therefore for at this point, even we did additional purchases once the window opens and not committing to anything at this point, because we always say there's a balance between potential M&A and share repurchases. It wouldn't have a significant impact on our way so this year. So, any sort of additional purchases of our shares repurchases would be more of an impact for 2022. And obviously, we'll talk about that in detail when we come up to the guidance for 2022 early next year. Yes. So, I -- at this point, obviously we have a broad range, but I would say that just like we've done in other periods of time. We'll look for and identify offsets to that. So, I -- it's not significant enough that we should deviate on a multi-year outlook in terms of our earnings growth being in the high-single digits, and we -- although we have identified everything over the next several years. I'm sure as we move through time we'll look for other productivity opportunities to offset some of that."

I'm with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic\u2019s impact on the US health care system and the US economy and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Steve Rusckowski.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for being us today. We had another strong quarter and continued to build momentum, thanks to faster than expected recovery in our base business. Organic based testing revenues grew compared to 2019 levels in the quarter. This is the first quarter since 2019 that organic base testing revenues grew. The growth was driven by contributions from new hospital lab management contracts as well as people returning to health care systems. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months, which is reflected in the outlook we have provided for the remainder of 2021.\nMark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base testing revenue, slightly offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of last year. Compared to 2019, our base CIS revenue grew nearly 5% in the second quarter and it was up more than 1% excluding acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 45.2% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 5%. Compared to our second quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased nearly 7%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 2% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped up over the last year. Importantly, compareto our 2019 baseline, our base testing volumes were \u2026 We discussed making approximately $75 million in targeted investments to support our long term strategies to accelerate growth. These investments are ramping with $50 million expected to fall in the second half. We also continue to incur expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address supply chain challenges and maintain staffing levels to ensure high levels of service and quality as the base business recovers faster than expected. We forecast these expenses to be approximately $30 million in the back half of the year. Finally, the low end of our outlook assumes an average of at least 20,000 COVID-19 molecular tests per day and 3,000 serology tests per day. It also assumes low single digit revenue growth in our base business in the second half of '21 versus 2019. The midpoint of our guidance assumes slightly stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and a modestly faster recovery of the base business and the high end of our guidance assumes both a greater level of COVID-19 testing and the strong continued recovery in the base business.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we had another strong quarter with a faster than expected recovery in our base business. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months. And then finally, I'd like to thank all Quest employees and the team to serve the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. Now we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?\nOperator:  Our first question from Ann Hynes, Mizuho Securities.\nAnn Hynes: I just have a question on -- I think you just said your guidance assumes about 20,000 molecular tests per day. Is that average for the entire second half or is that exiting the year? Also, can you just talk about what your guidance assumes for any kind of labor and inflation pressures for the second half? And do you see that those getting worse or are they stable throughout the year?\nMark Guinan: So Ann, at 20,000 is not the exit rate, it is the average for the back half. The 20,000 was the baseline for the low end of guidance. To get to the middle part of guidance, we would expect somewhat stronger than 20,000, of course there's moving pieces because it's also dependent on how the base business moves. And then the high end of guidance would be significantly more COVID testing and then a stronger base business recovery more in the mid single digits revenue. So that's how we try to dimentionalize the range for you. In terms of labor pressure, we certainly saw some of that and we responded to it and that's built into the whole year. It's not accelerating at this point in our outlook in the back half. So we have a process where we make annual salary and wage adjustments that was implemented earlier in the year. We certainly make some market adjustments periodically, which we've done and that's not unusual. So there's nothing extraordinary in the back half of the year in terms of labor inflation.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: I guess my question for you, Steve. As we think about the PLN and the preferred networks, it sounds like we're seeing some progress there. But any color you can give us on the recovery and the uptake and the traction you're getting there, especially as we exit the COVID drag.\nSteve Rusckowski: So we're feeling about the programs we've put in place over the last couple of years, Brian. We started these with United, as you know. And then we mentioned that we have a program that we're working with Anthem across the country, so we feel good about. We continue to work on the programs with other payers that see this as an opportunity as well. And what I said in my remarks, we do see those payers and the volume going through those payers growing faster than our other base recovery. So we feel we're actually getting some traction where everything was put in place. And I can tell you the engagement between us and those organizations are quite good. And I've said before in my remarks, we see an opportunity to get a variation to move with a high quality low cost value laboratory like Quest Diagnostics and then tighten up the network to what we describe as for lab network. And it's really all about what we've talked about in my remarks around the triple aim and primarily in affordable care. So good progress. What we've done already is making advance in the opportunity and we see more opportunities in front of us.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the base business recovery. Was it fairly linear since the end of March to the commentary you made around June? And then was curious if you're seeing any sort of pent-up demand and whether you thought that might have helped the trajectory? Any commentary around test per acquisition that would be helpful.\nSteve Rusckowski: So we are seeing a nice step by step improvement in base business. I would say it's been a nice recovery over the sequence of the first half. You remember we entered the half with our base business being down somewhat around high single digits and kind of improved throughout Q1 and that continued into Q2. And there's different ways we look at it what is the clinical cost and we actually see good recovery in our general health business or current  business. I mentioned in my remarks, our advanced diagnostics business, which includes a portion of cancer and genetic  testing to recovery. We still see our prescription drug monitoring and toxicology business being somewhat of a laggard, but they're actually starting to recover, not back to '19 levels but it's coming along. And then on a geographic basis, we do see much of the country of the after \u201819 levels. And as I said before, the Northeast is stubborn -- we started to move in the right direction, Massachusetts and Connecticut and New York City being the slowest recoverer, if you will, and that's all boroughs, not just been happening. And we're hopeful as the opening continues as people get back into life within that\u2019s happening in New York that, that will recover as well. So to answer your question you started with it has more of a nice steady progression clinically and also geographically. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that?\nMark Guinan: The only thing I'll add, Jack, is that it is somewhat uneven even though it has been steady nationally. And we do have a couple of regions that are actually back to the volume growth we had in those first couple of months of 2020 before the pandemic. So that's why we're feeling good not just about utilization recovery, we're really good about getting back and working on the things with our key partners such as the PLN and other relationships that we've called out with some of the payers around value based contracting and then really continuing to have our strong relationships with hospital systems. And we've talked about how much progress we've made around POS. So the good news is that things are open for business. We're able to go back in to the offices, not completely, but much more than we were over the last 12 months plus. And therefore, we're getting back to what we were doing before the pandemic started.\nJack Meehan: And was there anything relating to pent-up demand that you saw?\nSteve Rusckowski: You know it\u2019s hard to tease out. What we talked about in our calculation of revenue per req is that we are seeing more tests per requisition. So one could assume that some of that is tag on the test because the divisions show a step up in the office and they haven't been there for 16 months. So hard to tell, you got to believe there's a little bit of that in my prepared remarks as people return and catch up on pre-pandemic levels. But we\u2019ve also, to Mark's point, that we\u2019ve done into '19 but remember when we started '20, we have some nice growth in the first couple of months. So we've got more opportunities in front of us to continue to recover and also build on top of what we see to gain that share we're planning for.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Just a quick follow-up and then sort of my main question. Just on the follow-up, you mentioned that you renewed the Aetna contract. So just wanted to understand how should we see the remodel, how should we think about the pricing impact for the next 12 months? And then when we think about the value based programs that you're now signing with payers. I think, Steve, you mentioned that it's actually growing faster than the rest of your book. Can you maybe give us some color on where you\u2019re seeing these value based relationships and mostly focused on commercial versus Medicare? And also what's the framework, are you sharing upside from the savings or are these more sort of fixed price contracts with some downside protection.\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark, do you want to talk about what\u2019s in\u2026\nMark Guinan: So first off, the Aetna contract was extended. It will be invisible to you because there was no significant change in pricing. And in that contract, we continue to build stronger elements of what we call value based programs and I'll touch on that in a minute, Ricky. So it's more focused on commercial, although obviously, Medicare Advantage as well. There are certain things you can do in the  commercial that are harder to do in Medicare Advantage because some of the rules around that program. But the framing is not us sharing our upside with them but really they're sharing their upside with us. So we win together. So as we show greater value for their membership by getting more work to a better value lab like ourselves relative to out of network providers or in some cases other high cost providers in network, obviously, their members or for their fully insured book, they themselves pay money, and then we earn upside to a base level contract. And that base contract is not at a discount, it's really been kind of a historical level. So we didn't have to give up in order to gain. But it was really more about the case that we've been making for years that's getting more and more buy-in from the payers that we're part of the solution. And working with us and not focusing on our price but focusing on what we can do to drive better quality, better service and better value for their members is good for everybody in that ecosystem. So that's really the elements we shared. Steerage when they give us list of accounts where a lot of efforts going to out of network or higher cost providers. We go in with their support, calling those to educate for the people who have  plans, coinsurance, et cetera. So the patients are bearing some of that higher cost, which obviously has more influence benefit that's fully covered by the payer in terms of the doctor. And then we talked about M&A incentives where in the past when we would buy hospital outreach as soon as we start billing it and fall to our price, obviously, and the huge windfall to the payers but that it's good for them if we buy outreach and therefore, instead of taking that debt immediately, maybe a step down in those rates and we share some of those savings over those first couple of years. And that's an element we've gotten into just like every one of the major payer contracts. So it's things like that, Ricky, where we've made the case and they're finally buying in that when we're successful and they're successful together we can do more of that and therefore, there is upside than in the past we didn't see that now we have a chance to earn when we prove that we've actually saved them money and driven improvement for their members.\nRicky Goldwasser: So just one follow-up on the upside payment to base levels. So should we think about that now that sort of at the end of the year as you calculated by the upside, we could see upside to numbers from payments at the end of the year, or is this something that would just kind of flow through on a quarterly basis?\nMark Guinan: Well, I'll address the two examples I gave. So in the steerage one, where we're moving work, it's really more quarterly. So it's a constant look at that. We have a formula for doing that and then we're reimbursed more regularly. It's not a once a year catch-up and that's much better for us for a lot of reasons, not just for more regular rev rec but also for accounting purposes and so on for both of us, that's a better approach. On the M&A, obviously, that would be somewhat invisible to you. Because when we do a deal what it just means is that we get paid more than we would have historically a little bit with some of a premium over what our negotiated rates would be for the volume that clearly has moved from that hospital system to us, the hospital outreach business. So you\u2019re not going to really see that. Again, that's going to be a regular monthly quarterly thing, not a catch up.\nOperator: Our next question now is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.\nRalph Giacobbe: So you mentioned PAMA in the prepared remarks, and looks like the cuts are likely to restart next year. Maybe just remind us the headwind. And then at your Analyst Day, you suggested an EPS range for 2022 and kind of pointed to the higher end, I think, closer to an $8 number. Just wanted to confirm that, that assumed PAMA was coming back. And then just your comments on incremental investments that you talked about in the back half. Just wondering does that change anything related to that $8 number that we should be thinking about for 2022?\nSteve Rusckowski: Let me start with PAMA. So remember we said in our remarks we're filing hard to get a better answer on PAMA. And so hopefully, that was clear in the remarks. We do believe that the MedPAC report, those gave us some data that suggests that we were right with saying that if you collected all the data, it was representative that there will be a 10% to 15% reduction in the rates versus what we see now. And we obviously have some work to work with reduction in the price cost, not a reduction in the clinical outreach, just to make that clear, an increase of 10% to 15%. And in that regard, we have some work to do to get that through congress because it's going to be a legislative fix but we're going to keep on pushing on that. But with all that said what I'll keep on saying is we're assuming worst case in our outlook that in '22, we'll see another top. So that's clear. And then Mark, do you want to talk a little bit on the range and where are we pointed to at Investor Day.\nMark Guinan: So what I would say is that I laid out the CAGRs from 2018 and said obviously, the pandemic has clouded issues with the base business. And at some point, we all hoped COVID is a much smaller piece of our revenues. And the base business CAGR that we laid out would have suggested , and what we were saying is based on a base business being fully recovered by the end of the year and everything else that we're confident we should be in that range. And yes, we felt because of everything we knew at that point that it should be in the upper end of that . PAMA was absolutely included in that. As I shared that at this point, if nothing changes, should be the last year of the sizable reductions that we've had since PAMA was implemented. So based on the current fee schedule and the current methodology, there can be 15% cut on any CPT code next year. And we estimate our overall book of business is going to be somewhere between 10% to 15%, so higher than 10% but less than 15% based on what we can see. However, because that traditional Medicare book of business is much smaller than it was when we started, the dollar impact is actually going to be similar to what it was in the first couple of years of PAMA. So it\u2019s still a large number, somewhere around 1% of our overall revenues. And then once you get beyond that, even if PAMA isn't fixed, based on our understanding of commercial pricing and we don't know everything but certainly, we know our prices and we've shared that we\u2019ve really stabilized commercial pricing, combined with some competitive intelligence in the marketplace. We feel that while there might be some cuts with the recalculation they're going to be relatively small compared to what we incurred for several years.\nSteve Rusckowski: And we continue to feel good about the investments we're allowed to make on the additional resources. We talked about at Investor Day, about $75 million worth of investments. We talked today that continues in the back half of the year, that\u2019s guidance in the outlook or the guidance we provided. And it's entirely consistent with what we teed up at Investor Day and on our growth platforms. We're investing in both self plans relationships with hospital opportunities we see. We see opportunities to accelerate advanced diagnostics. We feel good about the recovery we've seen there and then also the opportunity we see around the consumer and consumer initiated testing. So our performance is allowing us to make these investments to accelerate growth, to get to the outlook that we provided to you for '22 and beyond, which is the 4% to 5% top line growth in high single digit earnings growth. So we feel good about our ability to make those investments and we're are making them. So we're hiring the people, we're spending the money and it's included in the guidance in the back half.\nMark Guinan: And then the revenue as well. So some of these are several years in the coming in terms of the return and some of them we get much more immediate. On consumer, we've talked about potential $0.25 million business by 2025, that's coming from small  before the pandemic. And so you could imagine that with some of the things we're doing, we're going to be building significant incremental revenue to get to that $250 million over the next couple of years. It's not going to all come in the last year or something like that. So we're getting revenue growth upside as well for those investments, not just incremental expense.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: Two quick follow-up questions here. On the 2021 guidance, you quantified the COVID assumptions and base business assumptions for the low end of guidance. Can you quantify the same levels for the midrange and the high range guidance? And just to clarify on the last question, the investments that you're making this year, does this continue into 2022 and beyond? Are they onetime in nature or do you have to add additional investments next year?\nMark Guinan: So I didn't intend to quantify with specificity been at high end, because it's a multivariable equation. So what I wanted to do was make clear the low end for a lot of reasons. You can imagine, we wanted to make people understand how we might get to that low end. And it's not a base business recovery that stalls or goes backwards so it's really a much slower than what we've seen and that we would expect. And we don't think there's a high probability for that. But one thing we've learned this pandemic is all these things are somewhat volatile and hard to predict. If you saw a lot of retrenchments across the country because of the celta variant or other things that might cause geographies to shut down, we want to make sure that we provide you guidance that are 95% plus deliverable or even more. So once you get beyond the floor, there's so many different moving parts that could go in opposite direction. It's kind of harder to give you a point estimate. We wanted to make sure that people also understood that the COVID average per day, we anticipate for the balance year significantly lower than we're getting right now. As you might imagine, we've been working on this outlook for a while. The recent news with obviously delta driving up the positivity rate cases, obviously, our volume is increasing. One thing we've also learned is not to overact the short term. So we're very transparent. So we give you those volumes every two weeks. So we felt that we can build reasonably deliverable, highly deliverable outlook to make clear what those assumptions are and especially around the COVID volumes, you're going to see that every two weeks. So you're going to know where we're going in terms of net outlook range that I laid out this morning.\nSteve Rusckowski: As far as the investments, some of the investments are temporal within '21. But as you would expect, we're investing in long term capabilities that will continue into '22. But rest assured that to be reapplied business case and the revenues associated would be there as well. So yes, we will have the outlook assumptions, we'll have some portion of these investments to '22 and trust that those investments are investments for us to do that.\nMark Guinan: And back to Ralph's question, again, I want to emphasize those were built into the outlook that I provided in Investor Day. So we've tried to make clear that we see these growth opportunities. The COVID revenue upside give us the opportunity not just to deliver some record earnings for the last couple of quarters but actually to invest and accelerate the long term prospects for our base business. So we thought it was the right balance between near term delivery results as well as the long term growth of the business. And so when I gave you that multiyear outlook for years and then when I frame 2022, those all fully contemplated these investments.\nPito Chickering: So then just on that one, is it fair to say that you are reiterating the number today for 2022?\nMark Guinan - CFO: Yes, so nothing's changed. So we would feel compelled if there was something over the last six months that would cause us to feel that, that range was no longer appropriate. We will take some of it, absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question now is from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo.\nTim Daley: This is actually Tim Daley on for Dan. So I just wanted to dig a bit more on Pito's question. So I believe the back to school total opportunity has framed as upside in relation to the guidance for the second half of the year. So first, I just wanted to clarify, is there any back to school testing baked into the COVID guidance or company level ranges discussed? And then secondly, given we are kind of weeks away from kids heading back to school. I'm sure there's been some discussions, but could you give us some insight into the internal on the ground discussions happening? Like are there broad based general screening plans for back to school and maybe a big one off push at the start of the year? Just any more additional color there would be really helpful.\nSteve Rusckowski: So Mark just laid out expectations around COVID testing. We did assume that the clinical testing would come down and the return to life testing would go off and a portion of that return to life has to do back to school programs. And what we highlighted is we've been working with the different partners with two programs that are funded with the funding for testing. One is the 600 million program for return to school programs where we have partners to help us with that and school systems throughout the United States could apply for that money and get money to reimburse whatever program come up. And then there's a larger program to about $10 billion. But as you can understand, I mean, every school system throughout the United States is going to have its own plan. And so they're going to start ramping up soon than into the month of August and in September. And I think there is going to be a fair amount of variance across the United States and who does what, when. And I do believe that given what we see now with the delta variant, I'm sure that will have some bearing on the need for testing to make sure that we're safe when kids return back to school. And also return to office programs, we do expect that there will be more returning to the workplace, those people that have been working remotely. I think clearly, there's been heightened level of safety with that happening. And as I said in my earlier remarks, testing is vital to that. So we've embedded that in our expectations as well. But we assume that clinical testing would come down. We believe that a lot of our capacity is not used for the hospital portion of COVID testing as in the early days of COVID testing. And some of the recent increase that we've seen has been related to some of the effects we see from the delta variant so far in the last week or two. So hopefully, I\u2019ve provided some color on what's assumed in the guidance so far.\nMark Guinan: I just want to remind everybody how that surveillance testing works. It's very different than our clinical testing. So if you think about the PCR test today where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we have come up with the numbers are as well, our methodology is a heavily pulled approach. We pull a handful of samples today when we're testing in low positive regions for economic reasons. But it's our responsibility if we are positive to retest those individual samples. So you don't want to pull too many because the math suggests that you're going to be retesting a lot of samples. And so when you go to surveillance, the assumption is that nobody has it. And so therefore, you're going to do a lot less retesting. But actually, in this case, we're not obligated to do it because they\u2019re not even identified. So what happens is the collections done, the entity, in this case, the school, knows whose 10 samples, let's say, are in that specimen collection device. It's not shared with us. All we do is test it and we say this is negative hopefully. And in the case where it's positive then they, the administrators, know which students need to be retested. And then that's a separate order. That's a separate payment, et cetera. And so the reason that's important is that in order to make this economic and because the economies can be kept with this huge coin, we have to do approximately 10 specimens to equate to a single one for our core PCR vessel. So the volumes have to be 10 fold at the same dollar values for our top line. So yes, there's absolutely some contracts we won, we\u2019ve got some of that volume. But to really move the needle it has to be really broadly endorsed and embraced. And while the funding there, to this point, we've seen some momentum but not enough to be significant at this point and really move the needle to offset the decline in the clinical testing we've seen over the last several months.\nOperator: Our next question now is from Derrick Brown with Bank of America.\nDerrick Brown: So twp quick questions. Just a little bit more color on the recovery in the base business, just are you seeing anything in particular in terms of oncology and esoteric versus routine testing? Just a little bit more color on that. You gave some geographical differences, but I'd love some mixed differences. And then another question that keeps coming up. In contrast, you're guiding to -- we just got off the  and they're talking about, they went from 10 million point of care tests in the first to 14 million point of care tests in the second quarter. So one of the question we continue to get on the central lab is the impact longer term on the business on point of care testing, is this trend going to continue, particularly given the number of players that are sort of entering this market from the point of care and at home space. So I'd love to hear your general thoughts on sort of your spot on volume shifts to certain applications into the point of care market? Thank you.\nSteve Rusckowski: Let me start with the first one. So what we said is our general health and our cardio metabolic testing, which is sometimes referred to by us as our general diagnostics and I would say the industry sometimes is also -- routine type of prognostic and that\u2019s in the United States and that\u2019s recovered there. Second, as you asked about oncology, we've seen some recovery at our AP business and pathology business. And as I said in my remarks, our advanced diagnostics business, which is our definition of sometimes called esoteric has actually recovered nicely, and we are making investments there, and we think we're tracking well against our investment accelerated growth plan. So we feel good about that. And the second question, which has to do with point of care. And when I say point of care, the PCR point of care and then also the antigen test. We do believe there's some portion of the testing demand, if you will, that's taking place with these new approaches. We do believe there is a place that we would return to work programs related to testing and some of the point of care applications. Well equally what you see with our volumes somewhat stabilized, as you saw in the second quarter when we report our numbers and the modest increase that we saw is PCR continues to be the gold standard. And so in many cases, they do reflex back to the PCR testing when there is a positive for sure, questionable negative metric not the false negative. So we do believe we did a good place in the marketplace and we do believe there is point of care devices, including the antigen as well as PCR going forward.\nOperator: Our next question from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Julia on for Tycho today. A lot of my questions have been answered already. So just following up on an earlier question about your payer program. It's great to see that you're having success with United and Anthem and recently with new contract with Aetna as well. You previously said the volume through these relationships are growing faster than the rest of your book. Just curious if you can provide some additional color on how much faster these volumes are growing? And what kind of investments you are making to capitalize on these opportunities?\nMark Guinan: So as you might imagine, there's not an answer to how much faster because they're not all equal. And also there are more -- each of them have more concentration in certain geographies. So as we shared with Northeast and specifically New York City is growing at different rates. So if you assume that payer there, more membership there, we might have a different answer than the payers that are in Texas. So Florida, I would say, or even California. So we've looked at, because it's one of our key -- you know, we have a full process, we call the  and we have these breakthrough objectives, one of them is growing our share in these health plans. And we look at it regularly and we share information back and forth to understand kind of our share of wallet with those. And so we have chance to see as they themselves also are recovering in terms of the volume that's going through their membership, whether we seem to be growing at the same pace in that recovery. And that's the basis for our saying that we're growing faster. So you know in this business a couple of hundred basis points is a big difference. It's not going to be half a percent or double digit kind of differential. But couple of hundred basis points of share growth is meaningful. That's clearly what we saw before the pandemic started as you look back to our 2019 performance, what we shared in the first two months of 2020. So line of the business utilization becomes fully recovered what happen is that we'll get back to that, not just historical growth of market but finally getting to growth above that by share gains. And that's what we laid out in our multiyear outlook at Investor Day.\nSteve Rusckowski: And as far as investments, what Mark said is everyone plans all the detail, plan of what we're going to do to gain that share. And some of that happens nationally and some of it happens locally and some of it happens by line of business. So we do have some programs to go with the payer to grow national talents and their plan sponsors and plan sponsors. And so a lot of that is local. And so you asked the question where we're making investments. We'll put those investment dollars where we think we need extra capacity to drive those programs by payer. And there's a lot of variation around where those opportunities are by payer and that detail is what we're speaking to when we talked about investments in the health plans.\nMark Guinan: I'll just give you one other example, which we've shared in the past, but it's really expanded broadly. So take toxicology in perspective of monitoring. The payers as that is starting to grow and there was some concern the payers part around the behavior of some of the providers, they put in some really onerous rules in place, such as pre-authorization and so on. Of course that impacts everybody, including the people like ourselves who are very responsible around our panels and how we conduct ourselves. And so we went for some of the payers, talked to them about that and said, hey, not only is that not right for us, it's not right for the patient, because it's going to be make it more difficult for them to get testing they need. But also if you got rid of that, you would actually steer more work to the good less. And when I say it's not just certainly our chief competitor and some others are just like us, they're very responsible. We do good work and tops calling prescription monitoring. So they put in rules in place where we're actually vented from pre-op. So that's another example where it's really not an investment, it's an investment of time to work with them to get them to understand and get them to change some of these rules and behaviors. But again, as an example where we're benefiting but so are the patients and a lot of other people, because it's a more thoughtful approach to rules around lab testing.\nOperator: Our last question now is from Matt Larew with William Blair.\nMatt Larew: So the Clifton lab went live in January and Steve, I think you said the consolidation from it will wrap up here next month. In the past you talked about sort of doubling throughput, 30% more capacity, I think 50% increase in productivity. Just curious if there are any data points to share so far on how the consolidation is going, and how we should think about the impact to margins as volumes consolidated into Clifton?\nSteve Rusckowski: So we're pleased with what we're able to do. It's pretty remarkable that we built this facility in the middle of the pandemic and for all intents and purposes that are on track and it's up and running. And we bring in this facility to do that consolidation, we have to continue our program around organizational processes and harmonization around systems to get them all in the same platform within the new facility. So we're on the final strokes of that implementation, we feel good about it. And then in that facility, we have implemented a lot of the new systems we've been in place for our new immunoassay platform from Siemens, we talked about, it's a big investment for us. We are getting some pretty good gains for them and more to come. We\u2019ll put in place new front end automation and through the lab automation with our partner Inpeco. And actually, Siemens has done the systemization with that as well. So we are pleased with the progress made so far and we're looking forward to more productivity from that going forward as we continue to burn in systems and work out some of the early details and those improvements are already part of the 3% productivity gains that we have in our operational excellence program and that are already included in our outlook that we provided at Investor Day.\nMatt Larew: Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Okay. So thank you, everyone, for this call, and we appreciate your continued support. You have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Rusckowski",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and thanks, everyone, for being us today. We had another strong quarter and continued to build momentum, thanks to faster than expected recovery in our base business. Organic based testing revenues grew compared to 2019 levels in the quarter. This is the first quarter since 2019 that organic base testing revenues grew. The growth was driven by contributions from new hospital lab management contracts as well as people returning to health care systems. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months, which is reflected in the outlook we have provided for the remainder of 2021. Thanks, Mark. Well to summarize, we had another strong quarter with a faster than expected recovery in our base business. We are well positioned to continue our momentum and support the return to health care in the coming months. And then finally, I'd like to thank all Quest employees and the team to serve the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. Now we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? So we're feeling about the programs we've put in place over the last couple of years, Brian. We started these with United, as you know. And then we mentioned that we have a program that we're working with Anthem across the country, so we feel good about. We continue to work on the programs with other payers that see this as an opportunity as well. And what I said in my remarks, we do see those payers and the volume going through those payers growing faster than our other base recovery. So we feel we're actually getting some traction where everything was put in place. And I can tell you the engagement between us and those organizations are quite good. And I've said before in my remarks, we see an opportunity to get a variation to move with a high quality low cost value laboratory like Quest Diagnostics and then tighten up the network to what we describe as for lab network. And it's really all about what we've talked about in my remarks around the triple aim and primarily in affordable care. So good progress. What we've done already is making advance in the opportunity and we see more opportunities in front of us. So we are seeing a nice step by step improvement in base business. I would say it's been a nice recovery over the sequence of the first half. You remember we entered the half with our base business being down somewhat around high single digits and kind of improved throughout Q1 and that continued into Q2. And there's different ways we look at it what is the clinical cost and we actually see good recovery in our general health business or current  business. I mentioned in my remarks, our advanced diagnostics business, which includes a portion of cancer and genetic  testing to recovery. We still see our prescription drug monitoring and toxicology business being somewhat of a laggard, but they're actually starting to recover, not back to '19 levels but it's coming along. And then on a geographic basis, we do see much of the country of the after \u201819 levels. And as I said before, the Northeast is stubborn -- we started to move in the right direction, Massachusetts and Connecticut and New York City being the slowest recoverer, if you will, and that's all boroughs, not just been happening. And we're hopeful as the opening continues as people get back into life within that's happening in New York that, that will recover as well. So to answer your question you started with it has more of a nice steady progression clinically and also geographically. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that? You know it's hard to tease out. What we talked about in our calculation of revenue per req is that we are seeing more tests per requisition. So one could assume that some of that is tag on the test because the divisions show a step up in the office and they haven't been there for 16 months. So hard to tell, you got to believe there's a little bit of that in my prepared remarks as people return and catch up on pre-pandemic levels. But we've also, to Mark's point, that we've done into '19 but remember when we started '20, we have some nice growth in the first couple of months. So we've got more opportunities in front of us to continue to recover and also build on top of what we see to gain that share we're planning for. Mark, do you want to talk about what's in... Let me start with PAMA. So remember we said in our remarks we're filing hard to get a better answer on PAMA. And so hopefully, that was clear in the remarks. We do believe that the MedPAC report, those gave us some data that suggests that we were right with saying that if you collected all the data, it was representative that there will be a 10% to 15% reduction in the rates versus what we see now. And we obviously have some work to work with reduction in the price cost, not a reduction in the clinical outreach, just to make that clear, an increase of 10% to 15%. And in that regard, we have some work to do to get that through congress because it's going to be a legislative fix but we're going to keep on pushing on that. But with all that said what I'll keep on saying is we're assuming worst case in our outlook that in '22, we'll see another top. So that's clear. And then Mark, do you want to talk a little bit on the range and where are we pointed to at Investor Day. And we continue to feel good about the investments we're allowed to make on the additional resources. We talked about at Investor Day, about $75 million worth of investments. We talked today that continues in the back half of the year, that's guidance in the outlook or the guidance we provided. And it's entirely consistent with what we teed up at Investor Day and on our growth platforms. We're investing in both self plans relationships with hospital opportunities we see. We see opportunities to accelerate advanced diagnostics. We feel good about the recovery we've seen there and then also the opportunity we see around the consumer and consumer initiated testing. So our performance is allowing us to make these investments to accelerate growth, to get to the outlook that we provided to you for '22 and beyond, which is the 4% to 5% top line growth in high single digit earnings growth. So we feel good about our ability to make those investments and we're are making them. So we're hiring the people, we're spending the money and it's included in the guidance in the back half. As far as the investments, some of the investments are temporal within '21. But as you would expect, we're investing in long term capabilities that will continue into '22. But rest assured that to be reapplied business case and the revenues associated would be there as well. So yes, we will have the outlook assumptions, we'll have some portion of these investments to '22 and trust that those investments are investments for us to do that. So Mark just laid out expectations around COVID testing. We did assume that the clinical testing would come down and the return to life testing would go off and a portion of that return to life has to do back to school programs. And what we highlighted is we've been working with the different partners with two programs that are funded with the funding for testing. One is the 600 million program for return to school programs where we have partners to help us with that and school systems throughout the United States could apply for that money and get money to reimburse whatever program come up. And then there's a larger program to about $10 billion. But as you can understand, I mean, every school system throughout the United States is going to have its own plan. And so they're going to start ramping up soon than into the month of August and in September. And I think there is going to be a fair amount of variance across the United States and who does what, when. And I do believe that given what we see now with the delta variant, I'm sure that will have some bearing on the need for testing to make sure that we're safe when kids return back to school. And also return to office programs, we do expect that there will be more returning to the workplace, those people that have been working remotely. I think clearly, there's been heightened level of safety with that happening. And as I said in my earlier remarks, testing is vital to that. So we've embedded that in our expectations as well. But we assume that clinical testing would come down. We believe that a lot of our capacity is not used for the hospital portion of COVID testing as in the early days of COVID testing. And some of the recent increase that we've seen has been related to some of the effects we see from the delta variant so far in the last week or two. So hopefully, I've provided some color on what's assumed in the guidance so far. Let me start with the first one. So what we said is our general health and our cardio metabolic testing, which is sometimes referred to by us as our general diagnostics and I would say the industry sometimes is also -- routine type of prognostic and that's in the United States and that's recovered there. Second, as you asked about oncology, we've seen some recovery at our AP business and pathology business. And as I said in my remarks, our advanced diagnostics business, which is our definition of sometimes called esoteric has actually recovered nicely, and we are making investments there, and we think we're tracking well against our investment accelerated growth plan. So we feel good about that. And the second question, which has to do with point of care. And when I say point of care, the PCR point of care and then also the antigen test. We do believe there's some portion of the testing demand, if you will, that's taking place with these new approaches. We do believe there is a place that we would return to work programs related to testing and some of the point of care applications. Well equally what you see with our volumes somewhat stabilized, as you saw in the second quarter when we report our numbers and the modest increase that we saw is PCR continues to be the gold standard. And so in many cases, they do reflex back to the PCR testing when there is a positive for sure, questionable negative metric not the false negative. So we do believe we did a good place in the marketplace and we do believe there is point of care devices, including the antigen as well as PCR going forward. And as far as investments, what Mark said is everyone plans all the detail, plan of what we're going to do to gain that share. And some of that happens nationally and some of it happens locally and some of it happens by line of business. So we do have some programs to go with the payer to grow national talents and their plan sponsors and plan sponsors. And so a lot of that is local. And so you asked the question where we're making investments. We'll put those investment dollars where we think we need extra capacity to drive those programs by payer. And there's a lot of variation around where those opportunities are by payer and that detail is what we're speaking to when we talked about investments in the health plans. So we're pleased with what we're able to do. It's pretty remarkable that we built this facility in the middle of the pandemic and for all intents and purposes that are on track and it's up and running. And we bring in this facility to do that consolidation, we have to continue our program around organizational processes and harmonization around systems to get them all in the same platform within the new facility. So we're on the final strokes of that implementation, we feel good about it. And then in that facility, we have implemented a lot of the new systems we've been in place for our new immunoassay platform from Siemens, we talked about, it's a big investment for us. We are getting some pretty good gains for them and more to come. We'll put in place new front end automation and through the lab automation with our partner Inpeco. And actually, Siemens has done the systemization with that as well. So we are pleased with the progress made so far and we're looking forward to more productivity from that going forward as we continue to burn in systems and work out some of the early details and those improvements are already part of the 3% productivity gains that we have in our operational excellence program and that are already included in our outlook that we provided at Investor Day. Okay. So thank you, everyone, for this call, and we appreciate your continued support. You have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.55 billion, up approximately 40% versus the prior year. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services grew 40.2% compared to the prior year, which reflected the strong recovery in our base testing revenue, slightly offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of last year. Compared to 2019, our base CIS revenue grew nearly 5% in the second quarter and it was up more than 1% excluding acquisitions. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 45.2% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing approximately 5%. Compared to our second quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased nearly 7%. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew approximately 2% and benefited from new PLS contracts that have ramped up over the last year. Importantly, compareto our 2019 baseline, our base testing volumes were ... We discussed making approximately $75 million in targeted investments to support our long term strategies to accelerate growth. These investments are ramping with $50 million expected to fall in the second half. We also continue to incur expenses to comply with CDC guidelines, address supply chain challenges and maintain staffing levels to ensure high levels of service and quality as the base business recovers faster than expected. We forecast these expenses to be approximately $30 million in the back half of the year. Finally, the low end of our outlook assumes an average of at least 20,000 COVID-19 molecular tests per day and 3,000 serology tests per day. It also assumes low single digit revenue growth in our base business in the second half of '21 versus 2019. The midpoint of our guidance assumes slightly stronger COVID-19 molecular testing volumes and a modestly faster recovery of the base business and the high end of our guidance assumes both a greater level of COVID-19 testing and the strong continued recovery in the base business. So Ann, at 20,000 is not the exit rate, it is the average for the back half. The 20,000 was the baseline for the low end of guidance. To get to the middle part of guidance, we would expect somewhat stronger than 20,000, of course there's moving pieces because it's also dependent on how the base business moves. And then the high end of guidance would be significantly more COVID testing and then a stronger base business recovery more in the mid single digits revenue. So that's how we try to dimentionalize the range for you. In terms of labor pressure, we certainly saw some of that and we responded to it and that's built into the whole year. It's not accelerating at this point in our outlook in the back half. So we have a process where we make annual salary and wage adjustments that was implemented earlier in the year. We certainly make some market adjustments periodically, which we've done and that's not unusual. So there's nothing extraordinary in the back half of the year in terms of labor inflation. The only thing I'll add, Jack, is that it is somewhat uneven even though it has been steady nationally. And we do have a couple of regions that are actually back to the volume growth we had in those first couple of months of 2020 before the pandemic. So that's why we're feeling good not just about utilization recovery, we're really good about getting back and working on the things with our key partners such as the PLN and other relationships that we've called out with some of the payers around value based contracting and then really continuing to have our strong relationships with hospital systems. And we've talked about how much progress we've made around POS. So the good news is that things are open for business. We're able to go back in to the offices, not completely, but much more than we were over the last 12 months plus. And therefore, we're getting back to what we were doing before the pandemic started. So first off, the Aetna contract was extended. It will be invisible to you because there was no significant change in pricing. And in that contract, we continue to build stronger elements of what we call value based programs and I'll touch on that in a minute, Ricky. So it's more focused on commercial, although obviously, Medicare Advantage as well. There are certain things you can do in the  commercial that are harder to do in Medicare Advantage because some of the rules around that program. But the framing is not us sharing our upside with them but really they're sharing their upside with us. So we win together. So as we show greater value for their membership by getting more work to a better value lab like ourselves relative to out of network providers or in some cases other high cost providers in network, obviously, their members or for their fully insured book, they themselves pay money, and then we earn upside to a base level contract. And that base contract is not at a discount, it's really been kind of a historical level. So we didn't have to give up in order to gain. But it was really more about the case that we've been making for years that's getting more and more buy-in from the payers that we're part of the solution. And working with us and not focusing on our price but focusing on what we can do to drive better quality, better service and better value for their members is good for everybody in that ecosystem. So that's really the elements we shared. Steerage when they give us list of accounts where a lot of efforts going to out of network or higher cost providers. We go in with their support, calling those to educate for the people who have  plans, coinsurance, et cetera. So the patients are bearing some of that higher cost, which obviously has more influence benefit that's fully covered by the payer in terms of the doctor. And then we talked about M&A incentives where in the past when we would buy hospital outreach as soon as we start billing it and fall to our price, obviously, and the huge windfall to the payers but that it's good for them if we buy outreach and therefore, instead of taking that debt immediately, maybe a step down in those rates and we share some of those savings over those first couple of years. And that's an element we've gotten into just like every one of the major payer contracts. So it's things like that, Ricky, where we've made the case and they're finally buying in that when we're successful and they're successful together we can do more of that and therefore, there is upside than in the past we didn't see that now we have a chance to earn when we prove that we've actually saved them money and driven improvement for their members. Well, I'll address the two examples I gave. So in the steerage one, where we're moving work, it's really more quarterly. So it's a constant look at that. We have a formula for doing that and then we're reimbursed more regularly. It's not a once a year catch-up and that's much better for us for a lot of reasons, not just for more regular rev rec but also for accounting purposes and so on for both of us, that's a better approach. On the M&A, obviously, that would be somewhat invisible to you. Because when we do a deal what it just means is that we get paid more than we would have historically a little bit with some of a premium over what our negotiated rates would be for the volume that clearly has moved from that hospital system to us, the hospital outreach business. So you're not going to really see that. Again, that's going to be a regular monthly quarterly thing, not a catch up. So what I would say is that I laid out the CAGRs from 2018 and said obviously, the pandemic has clouded issues with the base business. And at some point, we all hoped COVID is a much smaller piece of our revenues. And the base business CAGR that we laid out would have suggested , and what we were saying is based on a base business being fully recovered by the end of the year and everything else that we're confident we should be in that range. And yes, we felt because of everything we knew at that point that it should be in the upper end of that . PAMA was absolutely included in that. As I shared that at this point, if nothing changes, should be the last year of the sizable reductions that we've had since PAMA was implemented. So based on the current fee schedule and the current methodology, there can be 15% cut on any CPT code next year. And we estimate our overall book of business is going to be somewhere between 10% to 15%, so higher than 10% but less than 15% based on what we can see. However, because that traditional Medicare book of business is much smaller than it was when we started, the dollar impact is actually going to be similar to what it was in the first couple of years of PAMA. So it's still a large number, somewhere around 1% of our overall revenues. And then once you get beyond that, even if PAMA isn't fixed, based on our understanding of commercial pricing and we don't know everything but certainly, we know our prices and we've shared that we've really stabilized commercial pricing, combined with some competitive intelligence in the marketplace. We feel that while there might be some cuts with the recalculation they're going to be relatively small compared to what we incurred for several years. And then the revenue as well. So some of these are several years in the coming in terms of the return and some of them we get much more immediate. On consumer, we've talked about potential $0.25 million business by 2025, that's coming from small  before the pandemic. And so you could imagine that with some of the things we're doing, we're going to be building significant incremental revenue to get to that $250 million over the next couple of years. It's not going to all come in the last year or something like that. So we're getting revenue growth upside as well for those investments, not just incremental expense. So I didn't intend to quantify with specificity been at high end, because it's a multivariable equation. So what I wanted to do was make clear the low end for a lot of reasons. You can imagine, we wanted to make people understand how we might get to that low end. And it's not a base business recovery that stalls or goes backwards so it's really a much slower than what we've seen and that we would expect. And we don't think there's a high probability for that. But one thing we've learned this pandemic is all these things are somewhat volatile and hard to predict. If you saw a lot of retrenchments across the country because of the celta variant or other things that might cause geographies to shut down, we want to make sure that we provide you guidance that are 95% plus deliverable or even more. So once you get beyond the floor, there's so many different moving parts that could go in opposite direction. It's kind of harder to give you a point estimate. We wanted to make sure that people also understood that the COVID average per day, we anticipate for the balance year significantly lower than we're getting right now. As you might imagine, we've been working on this outlook for a while. The recent news with obviously delta driving up the positivity rate cases, obviously, our volume is increasing. One thing we've also learned is not to overact the short term. So we're very transparent. So we give you those volumes every two weeks. So we felt that we can build reasonably deliverable, highly deliverable outlook to make clear what those assumptions are and especially around the COVID volumes, you're going to see that every two weeks. So you're going to know where we're going in terms of net outlook range that I laid out this morning. And back to Ralph's question, again, I want to emphasize those were built into the outlook that I provided in Investor Day. So we've tried to make clear that we see these growth opportunities. The COVID revenue upside give us the opportunity not just to deliver some record earnings for the last couple of quarters but actually to invest and accelerate the long term prospects for our base business. So we thought it was the right balance between near term delivery results as well as the long term growth of the business. And so when I gave you that multiyear outlook for years and then when I frame 2022, those all fully contemplated these investments. I just want to remind everybody how that surveillance testing works. It's very different than our clinical testing. So if you think about the PCR test today where we're averaging over $90 per test, that's not economical for surveillance. So what we have come up with the numbers are as well, our methodology is a heavily pulled approach. We pull a handful of samples today when we're testing in low positive regions for economic reasons. But it's our responsibility if we are positive to retest those individual samples. So you don't want to pull too many because the math suggests that you're going to be retesting a lot of samples. And so when you go to surveillance, the assumption is that nobody has it. And so therefore, you're going to do a lot less retesting. But actually, in this case, we're not obligated to do it because they're not even identified. So what happens is the collections done, the entity, in this case, the school, knows whose 10 samples, let's say, are in that specimen collection device. It's not shared with us. All we do is test it and we say this is negative hopefully. And in the case where it's positive then they, the administrators, know which students need to be retested. And then that's a separate order. That's a separate payment, et cetera. And so the reason that's important is that in order to make this economic and because the economies can be kept with this huge coin, we have to do approximately 10 specimens to equate to a single one for our core PCR vessel. So the volumes have to be 10 fold at the same dollar values for our top line. So yes, there's absolutely some contracts we won, we've got some of that volume. But to really move the needle it has to be really broadly endorsed and embraced. And while the funding there, to this point, we've seen some momentum but not enough to be significant at this point and really move the needle to offset the decline in the clinical testing we've seen over the last several months. So as you might imagine, there's not an answer to how much faster because they're not all equal. And also there are more -- each of them have more concentration in certain geographies. So as we shared with Northeast and specifically New York City is growing at different rates. So if you assume that payer there, more membership there, we might have a different answer than the payers that are in Texas. So Florida, I would say, or even California. So we've looked at, because it's one of our key -- you know, we have a full process, we call the  and we have these breakthrough objectives, one of them is growing our share in these health plans. And we look at it regularly and we share information back and forth to understand kind of our share of wallet with those. And so we have chance to see as they themselves also are recovering in terms of the volume that's going through their membership, whether we seem to be growing at the same pace in that recovery. And that's the basis for our saying that we're growing faster. So you know in this business a couple of hundred basis points is a big difference. It's not going to be half a percent or double digit kind of differential. But couple of hundred basis points of share growth is meaningful. That's clearly what we saw before the pandemic started as you look back to our 2019 performance, what we shared in the first two months of 2020. So line of the business utilization becomes fully recovered what happen is that we'll get back to that, not just historical growth of market but finally getting to growth above that by share gains. And that's what we laid out in our multiyear outlook at Investor Day. I'll just give you one other example, which we've shared in the past, but it's really expanded broadly. So take toxicology in perspective of monitoring. The payers as that is starting to grow and there was some concern the payers part around the behavior of some of the providers, they put in some really onerous rules in place, such as pre-authorization and so on. Of course that impacts everybody, including the people like ourselves who are very responsible around our panels and how we conduct ourselves. And so we went for some of the payers, talked to them about that and said, hey, not only is that not right for us, it's not right for the patient, because it's going to be make it more difficult for them to get testing they need. But also if you got rid of that, you would actually steer more work to the good less. And when I say it's not just certainly our chief competitor and some others are just like us, they're very responsible. We do good work and tops calling prescription monitoring. So they put in rules in place where we're actually vented from pre-op. So that's another example where it's really not an investment, it's an investment of time to work with them to get them to understand and get them to change some of these rules and behaviors. But again, as an example where we're benefiting but so are the patients and a lot of other people, because it's a more thoughtful approach to rules around lab testing."

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited.\nShawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m here with Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Mark Guinan, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics future results include, but are not limited to those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows, and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by: the pandemic\u2019s severity and duration; healthcare-insured, government, and client-payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests; the pandemic\u2019s impact on the US healthcare system and the US economy; and the timing, scope, and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, which are drivers beyond the company\u2019s knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. References to base testing volumes or base business refer to testing volumes, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Quest had a strong first quarter with our base businesses to continuing to recover the near pre-pandemic levels. Contributions from acquisitions and PLS relationships accelerated growth in the base business and helped offset the reduction in demand for COVID-19 testing, which was in line with industry trends. In March, for the first time since the pandemic began, monthly organic revenue in the base business grew versus our 2019 baseline. As we noted at our recent Investor Day, Quest is well positioned to grow as the US exits the pandemic and people return to normal activities and address the routine care issues that have been neglected over the past year.\nMark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.72 billion, up 49% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 52%, compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services into a lesser extent continued recovery in our base testing revenue, which increased versus the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions increased 25.6% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 4%. The impact of severe winter weather during the quarter negatively impacted volumes by approximately 2.5%. Compared to our first quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 1.5% and benefited from M&A and new POS partnerships that began in 2020. Excluding the net impact of weather in the first quarter as well as M&A and new PLS wins over the last year; base testing volumes declined approximately 7% in the first quarter versus the 2019 baseline and down 5% in March. This represents more of a same-store view of the recovery in our base business since the pandemic began. While COVID-19 testing volumes declined faster than expected throughout Q1, the decline coincided with reduced demand across the industry. Importantly, these volumes have stabilized over the last several weeks. We resulted approximately 9.1 million molecular tests and nearly 900,000 serology tests, contributing nearly 21% to volume growth in Q1 versus the prior year. We exited the first quarter averaging approximately 73,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 8,000 serology tests per day.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. And to summarize, we're off to a very strong start in 2021. Our base business continues to recover back to near pre-pandemic levels as people address the routine care issues that they have neglected over the past year. And then finally, I'd just like to thank all Quest employees who continue to serve the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. And so with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue.  Our first question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo: Hi. Thanks for taking my call.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Kevin.\nKevin Caliendo: Yeah. Good morning. So I guess, some of the commentary around 2Q, I sort of want to understand the expectation, it looked like March, the base business was up year-over-year, and your guidance is suggesting that 2Q would be down year-over-year. You don't expect it to recover fully. Is there anything that changed, or was March an anomaly, sort of, take us through what you're seeing in the base business in terms of the volumes?\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark?\nMark Guinan: Sure. So Kevin, when we talk about the base business, and sorry for any confusion, it being up in March. That included our new PLS wins, which were significant and also M&A. So it's the total base business that was not an organic number. What we tried to do was delineate where the -- what we call same-store, so kind of the apples and apples versus 2019 to give you a sense of where we think utilization is. So separate from new significant PLS wins and M&A where that base business performance is. So when we talk about expecting to be slightly down in Q2, that's that organic non-PLS utilization, same store number, not our total base business performance.\nSteve Rusckowski: So Mark, it\u2019d be good to share our implied view on what's going to happen COVID testing in Q2.\nMark Guinan: Yeah. So we talked about 100,000 a day in Q1. We talked about an expectation about 50,000, we also shared that we exited Q1 over 70,000, so that would imply a significant ramp down throughout the second quarter. And that's based on our expectation that vaccines will continue to roll out, we'll get more and more people who'll be protected and less and less clinical demand. And of course, we'll see how that plays out, but that is certainly within the guidance that we're providing today, how we see the next several months.\nSteve Rusckowski: So if you assume Kevin, our base business, it would include acquisitions in PLS and organic growth. But let's just focus on organic growth. The steady improvement that we've seen in Q1 continues in Q2. And then it's somewhat offset by what we are anticipating with COVID, and that gives us the expectation around ranges of guidance in the second quarter. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nMark Guinan: Yeah. And just to close it out, Kevin, I would point to the numbers that we quoted for Q1 of minus 7%. That's the same-store performance number. And we -- obviously, March was stronger than that. February was impacted by weather, as we said. But that -- we expect that minus 7% to improve, as Steve said, throughout Q2, but not yet to get positive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nErin Wright: Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Erin.\nErin Wright: Capital deployment is still one of the biggest questions we're getting from investors, are there any meaningful changes now in your view from an M&A pipeline perspective? And what's assumed in guidance in terms of inorganic growth? And longer term, here over the next few years, do you anticipate the pace of consolidation across the lab industry to accelerate, or do you anticipate a similar pace to what we've seen historically? And just somewhat tied to that as well, I mean, how should we be thinking about the broader excess capacity across the competitive landscape post-COVID? And how does that impact your positioning?\nMark Guinan: Hey, Steve, let me take the guidance question first, and then I'll turn it over to you. So Erin, our current guidance, obviously, is only through the second quarter, and we're not counting on any M&A that hasn't already been transacted. And even the deal that we announced Mercy is not going to close and generate any significant volume or revenue in the second quarter. So the current guidance does not anticipate future M&A. Steve?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. So we feel good about the discussions and the funnel of prospects we have for what we have characterized as our hospital strategy. There continues to be a lot of pressure on these pre-delivery systems. They are considering their last strategy is one of the options to help them. And we have a number of examples over the past six months on delivering on the strategies that we've talked about for years. And so the answer to your question, we do see a continuation of interest in the building funnel with more prospects to come. What we shared at Investor Day is we reaffirmed our outlook that we would grow through acquisition around 2% per year. What we shared is that, we historically have delivered on that at the three years prior to 2021. And we believe that's still a good guidance number for us for this year, and going forward, it's implied in our outlook for growth. So finally, as we do see the trends in general, just like all health care on consolidation. We do see systems interested in thinking about what's most important to them. And what's your strategy and Quest help them with their lab strategy. And likewise, we see, if you will, fewer and fewer in network providers with the health clients. And if you want to think about that, that is a consolidation play as well. And when those two forces happening, there will be more share in the hands of fewer, and our plan is to gain share. So all the megatrends and changes that are happening in the industry, we believe have actually improved to support what we've said for some time, and that our view is both for what's happening with hospitals and also what's happening with health plans.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Within the routine market, can you give us some more color on strength and weaknesses in different parts of the country? Looking at your customers, can you give us some color on dock offices versus hospitals versus the baseline and their routine tests? Any details you can give us on what types of test are normalizing and sort of what are the laggard areas?\nSteve Rusckowski: Sure. Sure. So let me take a run around all the different customers the way we look at the market. So geographically, we have seen good recovery in Texas and the South West. We're actually seeing, really in the last several weeks, starting a much better recovery in California in the West Coast, which is good news. We see the South East starting to recover and bring us back to the 2019 levels that we spoke to earlier. So I would say those are moving in the right direction. Now the offset to that is long as you've seen the spikes and the hotspots in the Midwest and when that happens in the lockdowns and people are concerned about going into health through delivery, that's going to affect our business. So we've seen some of that, let\u2019s say, in the Midwest. And then finally the Northeast and the Northeast including New York and Pennsylvania and going into New England. It's still behind, and it's recovering slowly, but we're the most off, if you will, in the Northeast. So that's the geographic swing. As far as physician business versus hospital business, the hospital business is actually very close to where we were. We're encouraged by that. We see remissions getting back to 2019 levels. We see outpatient procedures getting back to 2019 levels. So that business is tracking nicely compared to where we were. And then the physician side, it all depends on what type of physician. Primary care is starting to turn on oncology, particularly those that have postponed diagnosis and treatment for oncology starting to turn on. And at the same time, we still see our prescription drug monitoring business or mental health and behavioral health and drugs and abuse still down versus where we were at 2019. And that's an issue that varies by state to work in that. So that gives you a feel for what's going geographically. What's going on by physician, but also by what we described as clinical franchises. Mark, anything you\u2019d like to add to that?\nA \u2013 Mark Guinan: No, I think that's a good summary, Steve. Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Good morning.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. The higher revenue guidance, just want to understand, is that upside from 1Q? Because it sounded like COVID was maybe lower than you had expected. So just trying to understand if it reflects assumption of better core, or is it deals? Just maybe color there, reconciling the higher revenue? And then second, is the ASR included in the guidance? Because just based on the revenue increase and running through recent margin performance, it doesn't look like that's factored in, or otherwise, there would be an assumption of much lower margin. So I'm just trying to reconcile that as well. Thanks.\nA \u2013 Mark Guinan: Yes. So let me take a shot at that, Ralph, thanks. The higher revenue is absolutely driven by stronger-than-expected recovery in the base business. So as you point out, we've acknowledged and we record every couple of weeks, COVID testing has ramped down faster than we had anticipated throughout the first quarter. We continue to expect to have that ramp down, but the base business has recovered stronger, is most certainly more than an offset on the revenue side. In terms of the ASR, it is in the guidance. I just want to remind everyone that we have had committed to $900 million in share repurchases that was already in the guidance for the first half. We did $410 million in Q1. And then part of the ASR is related to the proceeds from the sale of our 40% ownership in our JV with IQVIA, and that is slightly accretive when you consider the loss of the equity earnings. So you need to look at over $600 million of the ASR as really offsetting the -- foregoing those equity earnings. We had already committed to $900 million in the previous guide in the first half, so almost $500 million there. So when you combine that, the share repurchases are really just up by several hundred million. So I want to make sure everyone is clear on the math there. So it is reflected in the guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. \nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys, congrats on the quarter. I guess, my question for you guys, Steve as you think about what you saw in Q1, specifically in March with the assumption of volumes in the core. What are you seeing in terms of acuity levels, like rep number of tests per req, or even revenue per req that you saw in March, is that carrying over already into April, just any color you can share with us on that? Thank you. \nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. So thanks, appreciate the question. Mark was encouraging, and we're watching April, carefully. And we do look at the number of test per requisition to see if we're getting more density, if you will, of testing for requisition, and we talked about new made explanation for increase in the calculation of revenue per req have to do with the COVID test, the straight calculation. But we have historically seen a, let's say, modest expansion of the newer test for variety of reasons, we offer more. Second, there is a higher level of acuity and chronic disease and aging of the population. So we have generally seen a general increase in that. But nothing that was really notable that's standing out within March.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Good morning. I was wondering, if you could give us an update around your thinking around COVID testing for the second half of the year? What do you expect in terms of, the base in terms of testing levels, and then also if you can give us an update as to how you think the school testing opportunity could shake out your reference that at the beginning. How do you feel your positioning is for the upcoming awards there?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. So you go back to where we started off the year. What we said is we do expect COVID, PCR testing to decline throughout the year and we mentioned in our remarks, you could see that in Q1, and we see it happening in the country. So as Mark said earlier, we do expect that continuing trend in Q2 and that will continue into the second half. Now with a little bit offset, we do see this transition from what we described as more clinical uses of the PCR testing, roll in and roll out COVID for hospitals, roll in, roll out patients seeing their physicians and moving it to return to life activities, and there's a lot of activity around that, Jack. A lot of activity, I mentioned in the remarks, what's going on around schools. There's two funding mechanisms for that from the U.S. government. We've actively engaged with a number of, let's call it, systems integrators that will be coordinating the efforts beyond the laboratory testing. We're well-positioned there. Secondly, is corporations are now thinking about how they get people back physically into their places of work, maybe albeit not as full-time as they want for. But despite the vaccination progress, they're still going to be testing requirements with the return to work activities. And then let me just say the entertainment piece of this is big, too. We see the sports teams, want to put paints back in the stands. We see New York City, interested in getting people back. The tourism as they get into the fall and turning back on the city, we mentioned in our prior remarks and other calls and meetings that we participated in this pilot study with New York to provide a check, if you will provide access for an individual over the course of the day. So that type of activity will be a larger portion of what we do for COVID testing in the back half. Now with all that said, we're not providing guidance for the back half, but we do see continued PCR testing in the back half, but it's going to change in this nature. And also, we do believe COVID-19 testing and PCR testing will continue in 2022. This is not going away fast.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Larew with William Blair. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hey, good morning, Matt.\nMatt Larew: Thanks for \u2013 yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, maybe a two part. The first would just be a follow-up to Jack's question, Steve, in terms of how much of that return to life testing opportunity really is going to be in a sort of a reference lab setting with the day or to turnaround time versus a point-of-care setting. But my question though was about the consumer market. I just wanted to get your take on sort of the PWN Everlywell combination and if that changes any of your approach or the competitive dynamics in that space?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. Yeah. So first of all, as you know, not all tests are created equal. And PCR still is the gold standard. And we do provide a solution with antigen testing, okay, as part of appropriate utilization of that testing, particularly for surveillance. But as we know, the antigen testing, sensitivity and specificity has been for let's say day two through day five of a potentially infected person. But the PCR test is really the gold standard to rollout, if someone has been exposed in the early days, there were rule out the pick are exposed in the late days. And so the sensitivity and specificity we have with our PCR testing is quite good. And so physician sell that, and therefore, that's why we're so confident that it will continue to be an important part of how we fight this pandemic. As far as the consumer, the consumers trying to figure out to get easy access to testing, and they will get that access in a variety of forms. And by the way, our turnaround time is now for PCR testing are much better on average than the two-ish days that we often thought about several months ago. We're now delivering results in less than the day for many \u2013 for many tests that come in. And the reason for that is, remember the remarks we're testing about 101,000 tests per day, and we have approximately 300,000 per day for capacity. So that allows us to have much better turnaround times, which we believe, as that becomes more and more visible and people want to get good access to the gold standard, they're going to rely on those places they can get access. So we continue our relationships with retailers. We're expanding our relationship with CVS has gone quite well. CVS is active on promoting good access to PCR testing around the drive ends and Walmart as well. And then also with our direct to the Quest capability that we talked about at our Investor Day, we have put on that platform, both PCR testing as well as serology testing. And we are seeing high levels of interest from a consumer perspective of what they could do simply by getting collection kit in the mail and a FedEx envelope to ship that back and good turnaround tied to start up of MyQuest. So that will continue to build, as the consumers -- as we start to return to life in a safe way. I want to be assured that even if they are vaccinated or they have natural immunity, we are not locking into a situation that they might have been exposed in some ways that they fell through the cracks with all the caveats we have with the effectiveness of the vaccines, the questions about natural immunity, and then also, with the new variance as well. So because of that, we keep on working on better and more efficient and easier ways for Americans to get access to PCR testing. And we've got now, I think, a lot of good chance to do that, and that will continue to be an opportunity for us in the back half.\nMark Guinan: Yeah. And Steve, I'd like to add. I want to make sure that Matt and others understand how the surveillance works. And in this case, when you pool you get the economics to where it's affordable to do more broadly and more regularly, because we're going to be putting up to 10 individual samples in a single well. And so hence, the cost will be 10% or less per individual. And what you sacrifice is, it's not a diagnostic, because we're not going to have the individuals identified in that well. The school or the entity that provides us the sample will have tool that they will know in test through that who the 10 people are. And if we come back to them with a positive result, they will apply a real diagnostic to those 10 individuals. So with that, we also don't have the obligation or the ability to retest. Whereas today, when we do pooling for clinical purposes, if we get a positive, we have to go back and retest the individual samples, so it actually is an inefficiency in our process. In order to get this to work, we don't do retesting of a sample. We don't have the capability of doing that. We notify the submitting entity that we had a positive in one of the pooled collection specimen tubes, and then they go forward and test those individuals.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Good morning. Hey, Tycho.\nMark Guinan: Tycho, you\u2019re on mute.\nSteve Rusckowski: You\u2019re on mute\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Sorry about that. This is Casey in for Tycho. Can you give us some color as to what the implied operating margin is for the EPS guide? And sort of what's the upside is from the ASR? And then just on serology, can you talk a little bit about you're not modeling a decrease in 2Q from 1Q, but PCR is going down. Can we assume the same level of serology testing throughout the back half of the year and explain maybe what the resilience is there? Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark, do you want to talk the ASR?\nMark Guinan: Well, the ASR is in our updated guidance. So there's not upside per se relative to before we announced the ASR, as I tried to walk through the math, about a little less than $400 million of the repurchases are truly incremental in terms of an EPS lift, because we had already committed to the full $900 million, and we had about $500 million remaining in Q2 that was already in the guidance. So that $1.5 billion goes down to $1 billion incremental. A little over $600 million of that is the proceeds from our divestiture of our stake in Q2, that's slightly accretive. But not materially relative to the -- for mature of the equity earnings there. So it's really less than $400 million of share repurchases that were incremental to what we guided to previously. And that is built into the updated guidance. In terms of implied operating margin, obviously, we have a range. So we can't answer that with precision. But if you take the midpoint, you can all do the math. As we get a lower mix of COVID testing at our assumption of the $100 reimbursement, obviously, realization in AWR that's less than that, $100 price point. And that mix is toward the base business that will erode the margin slightly. But the offset to that is the base business recovers, we're very leveraged. So the variable drop-through on that base business recovery, certainly much higher than our enterprise and historical fully loaded operating margin, but it's not quite as high as the COVID PCR.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. Serology, we imply that it will continue at the same level. We are pushing on the value of serology going forward. We believe that the semi-quant capability that we offer has nice insight into what response is happening in patients in general with the virus and therefore, that has value. We also believe that between historic PCR and serology, knowing that you've had the viruses important for Americans to know so. We keep on pushing down the value, and we will continue to look at new tests beyond that. We will be immune response long-term includes T cells. We don't have that, but we continue to look at that has been the prospect. So you should assume for now it's stable with what we've seen so far, but we continue to believe that's more and more valuable in the quarter. We continue to work on developing the test to support that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah, hi. Good morning. So two questions because I wanted to follow-up. So when we think about the first half guidance, it does imply that meaningful operating income sequential decline. I fully realize you're still not giving second half guidance. But just to maybe everybody on the call, sort of -- some, sort of, a framework as we think about a more normalized pace of the core business. How should we think about that margin headwind? I think it's just going to help us all as we think about the second half modeling. That's first. And then second, more is like long-term strategically. We're hearing the payers talk a lot about digital-first strategies and being like the front door to health care you guys talked about expanding relationship with payers like Anthem. So are you having any conversations with payers on how you can be part of that digital-first strategy in those digital networks? And if so, do you see that as an opportunity to accelerate more narrow networks that will drive volume toward you, and actually, would that require any additional investments or you think you have the infrastructure for that already?\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark, you take the first one, I'll take the second one.\nMark Guinan: Sure, Steve. Thanks for the Ricky. Again, just to reiterate, the first half, we delivered over 100,000 PCR COVID tests per day. We're assuming half that in Q2. So that's certainly contributing to the margin decline, as you talked about, implied in the guidance for the first half, implicitly in Q2. When you think about the base business, we're still uncertain how all those moving parts will play out in the second half, which is why we've not provided second half guidance that we want to wait until we can confidently give guidance that we're highly confident will be delivered. So what I would point to is that's the transition period, really look at an Investor Day and how we talked about 2022. And talking about getting our base business fully recovered by the end of this year, back to growth through the growth pillars and back to a margin level, pre-pandemic and then obviously improving beyond that, as we talked about a CAGR where our bottom line grows significantly faster than our top line by 700 basis points. So we feel very confidence in the earnings power of the base business. Certainly, we're going to have a step down from the pandemic bubble, where we did several billion dollars of COVID testing last year, and significant COVID testing this year. But the base business should be very healthy coming out of the pandemic once COVID testing drops to a minimal level. We'll be right back to the operating rhythm. Our expectation is that you saw early in 2019 when we were growing a business January, February, more than 5% on a volume basis, and you saw strong improvements in our operating margin. Steve?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. Yeah. Just to transition. So as you recall in our Investor Day, we went to a walk, if you will, to bridge you from the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 into 2022. Mark went through chart with some math, which gave you kind of our indication for 2022. And also, as I said earlier, is we do believe there would be some COVID testing, but the base business will be recovering, and we'll get growing \u2013 going forward in 2022 based upon our outlook. So the last question you add, Rick, you have to deal with the digital front end and digital-first and we're excited about this because we're very well positioned. This isn't something that we have just started working on. We've been working on it for a while. First of all, if you go back to a large provider like Quest, we're very much embedded in the ecosystem of connectivity already. We have over 500 interfaces of all the different electronic medical records, obviously, that's the big players like the Cerner, but there's hundreds of others. And so therefore, we have a real strong interoperability capability. And that's helpful because when you're in the workflow because from a disposition perspective, that allows you to more streamline the different service offerings like laboratory to fewer players. And then secondly is this past year, we've seen the acceptance, if you will of telehealth, it has been growing nicely but out explosively, and we did see explosive growth in 2020 and we believe that overall, that acceptance, if you will, of that front end, be an accepted way to first engage with the healthcare that this system will continue. And the payers are working on that and providers are working on that, and they're working with other partners, and we're very well positioned with those other partners. So who are those partners? Those partners are some of the telehealth companies that you know. And those telehealth companies, as they become much more indebted in healthcare delivery, let's call the digital equipment , will rely on a fewer number of laboratory service providers, and therefore, we're very well positioned as more of a small handful of what just described as the deferred lab network that we are ready with United, but for this new world that we see. And with all that, we do believe that our direct-to-consumer initiative will have an opportunity as well, because consumers equally are wanting to engage with upgrade delivery. They not always need to engage with this physician. And therefore, with the prospects we see of growing that business and the opportunity for consumers to serve themselves, if you will, which is a big opportunity for us. As far as investment, we are investing. We were fortunate enough to have the capabilities in 2020 and 2021. If you again go back to what we shared at Investor Day, we said we're investing about $75 million over a period over the last two years, 2020 and 2021. Some portion of that is related to what we're discussing here. And so, we're not rate limited by investments. We're rate limited by logistics time to get some traction, and we're very well positioned with the telehealth companies, very well positioned with the plans. And yes, we do see a change. And yes, this will allow us, again, to gain share as we go forward, because they can't do this with tens of laboratories, they can only do it with a select group like us. So we have another question?\nShawn Bevec: Operator?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi. Good morning.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hi, Derik.\nDerik de Bruin: Thanks for taking the question. Hey. So two questions. One is, I was on the Danaher call just before this, and they actually pretty sharply raised their COVID testing guidance for the year and also surprisingly gave a very bullish outlook for 2022 and sort of backing that number. So I think the first question goes to, is some of the -- this is a question on the point-of-care shifting from decentralized testing, shifting to point of care. Is some of the volume you're seeing coming down just because there are more of these point-of-care platforms out there and just as they ramp capacity, you're seeing volume shifting out of the central lab? That's the first question. And then I think the second question is, when you look at your -- you're at 100,000-ish test, you've got 300,000 capacity. How are you using -- how do you utilizing that capacity? Is it more -- are you ramping down your IVD platforms versus your LDT platforms? Just to assume that it's more of the IVD, because the LDTs are more profitable. But just would love some idea on sort of like how you're utilizing your installed base. Thank you.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So the first part, yes, we did see an increase in the availability and use of the antigen testing and point-of-care testing throughout the last 12 months that clearly has picked up in the back half of 2020. We see that continue in 2021. So if you look at the industry trackers of how much testing we are doing in this country, clearly, it has dropped off, and therefore, volumes have dropped off as well. We believe in those tracking mechanisms, it's predominantly PCR. However, we think there could be some point-of-care antigen testing in there, but we believe it does not include all the testing that\u2019s happening. So if you look at it, look, happy for PCR testing throughout the United States and if you look at the excellence that are coming from least point-of-care and antigen providers, you see that the actual level of testing is almost at the same level that we were in the summer, but in different forms. So the answer to your question is, yes, there is a transition from PCR is exclusively what we have to more of the capabilities around point-of-care and antigen testing. However, going back to what I said, all tests are not created equal. And so we're also working with clients to make sure they realize where antigen testing can be helpful for a period of time. And also what you need to reflex into PCR and where you can use point-of-care and costs are not all created equal. So it has come down because of what we described, but there continues to be a strong role for PCR through the remainder of 2021 and also into 2022.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Hey, guys, thanks for follow-up question here. Could you give us a little more details on the changes of what the UnitedHealthcare did for out-of-network providers in the quarter, what markets did they make this change in, what impacts did you see in your volumes from these changes? Thanks so much.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yeah. Yeah. So what we have been working on as a journey to pick up share, if you will, it can be mated what we shared in March at our Investor Day is we really kicked off the network program in 2019. We saw a good progress there. We're actually very encouraged by what we saw in 2020, it's very early days, and then we have the pandemic. But it didn't stop our activity. So what we shared is we actually picked up some share over that period of time, but we have more share to gain. And there's a list of activities we're working with United to support picking up share and getting it to at least that 25% level, one of which is what we're providing is limiting the other network policy and benefit design for their fully insured book. And where that has happened because we have other examples of the topic, it does move share to us. We don't provide specifics on states and specifics on how much did this contribute to share. But it did have a nice impact for us to allow us to pick up share. And so we continue that market. But I'll also share that we didn't share everything we're doing. There are many other programs, and some of this is working with their plan sponsors. Their employers, some of this is working with their regions, specific opportunities with providers. When we do an outreach purchase and relationship within the geography, whose work on expensive venue to a less expensive venue, which is Quest, and all of those are active relationships that we have to continue to build share with United and other payers is equally will continue to work programs with the Anthem and others.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Eugene Kim with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: Hello.\nEugene Kim: Hi, good morning. So quickly on 2022, at the Investor Day, the company provided a baseline EPS range of $7.40 and $8, and I believe fund to the higher end of that range. And that was what assumption that base business recovery return to pre-pandemic levels toward the end of the year. With the potential -- I mean, the recovery come faster than expectation, how should we think about that range that provided at the Investor Day? Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: Mark? Hey, Mark you there?\nMark Guinan: Yeah. So the -- what I would say is, I'm not in a position to update that what we provided at Investor Day, because we could get in a rhythm of constantly getting asked to update that. So next time we'll comment will be when we provide guidance for 2022. But of course, as we have that broader range, there's a lot of different considerations, what the remaining level of COVID testing, what's the reimbursement level. Where is the base business at? When we gave the $7.48, as we said, we're expecting the base business to be fully recovered this year to be back to 2019 baseline and starting to grow. But depending on the pace of some of these initiatives that are being rolled out by several payers, not just United by Anthem and some of the other major players depending on the economy, depending on, obviously, potential expansion of covered lives. There's a lot of variables that we'll know a lot more about by the end of the year before we give guidance for 2022. So stronger recovery of the base business, good fact, I wouldn't say at this point that, the faster decline in COVID testing yet necessarily implies anything for 2022 around our comments. Because we assumed it would still be around, and you heard from others as well. Nobody thinks is going away. And we were not expecting it to be anywhere near the significance that it was in 2020 and in 2021. So \u2013 and then you've got the ASR we just announced. So there's a lot of different moving pieces. So we'll give you an update on 2022, when we provide our guidance for 2022. We just wanted to ground people at Investor Day, because the pandemic really confounded everyone's ability to understand our long-term earnings power, and that's why we thought it was important to make a specific comment on 2022.\nShawn Bevec: Good. So I think we've covered all the questions. We appreciate you joining the call. We appreciate your continued support, and have a great day, everybody. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics first quarter 2021 conference call.

            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Quest had a strong first quarter with our base businesses to continuing to recover the near pre-pandemic levels. Contributions from acquisitions and PLS relationships accelerated growth in the base business and helped offset the reduction in demand for COVID-19 testing, which was in line with industry trends. In March, for the first time since the pandemic began, monthly organic revenue in the base business grew versus our 2019 baseline. As we noted at our recent Investor Day, Quest is well positioned to grow as the US exits the pandemic and people return to normal activities and address the routine care issues that have been neglected over the past year. Thanks, Mark. And to summarize, we're off to a very strong start in 2021. Our base business continues to recover back to near pre-pandemic levels as people address the routine care issues that they have neglected over the past year. And then finally, I'd just like to thank all Quest employees who continue to serve the needs of people who rely on Quest every day. And so with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Hi, Kevin. Mark? So Mark, it'd be good to share our implied view on what's going to happen COVID testing in Q2. So if you assume Kevin, our base business, it would include acquisitions in PLS and organic growth. But let's just focus on organic growth. The steady improvement that we've seen in Q1 continues in Q2. And then it's somewhat offset by what we are anticipating with COVID, and that gives us the expectation around ranges of guidance in the second quarter. So hopefully, that's helpful. Hi, Erin. Yeah. So we feel good about the discussions and the funnel of prospects we have for what we have characterized as our hospital strategy. There continues to be a lot of pressure on these pre-delivery systems. They are considering their last strategy is one of the options to help them. And we have a number of examples over the past six months on delivering on the strategies that we've talked about for years. And so the answer to your question, we do see a continuation of interest in the building funnel with more prospects to come. What we shared at Investor Day is we reaffirmed our outlook that we would grow through acquisition around 2% per year. What we shared is that, we historically have delivered on that at the three years prior to 2021. And we believe that's still a good guidance number for us for this year, and going forward, it's implied in our outlook for growth. So finally, as we do see the trends in general, just like all health care on consolidation. We do see systems interested in thinking about what's most important to them. And what's your strategy and Quest help them with their lab strategy. And likewise, we see, if you will, fewer and fewer in network providers with the health clients. And if you want to think about that, that is a consolidation play as well. And when those two forces happening, there will be more share in the hands of fewer, and our plan is to gain share. So all the megatrends and changes that are happening in the industry, we believe have actually improved to support what we've said for some time, and that our view is both for what's happening with hospitals and also what's happening with health plans. Sure. Sure. So let me take a run around all the different customers the way we look at the market. So geographically, we have seen good recovery in Texas and the South West. We're actually seeing, really in the last several weeks, starting a much better recovery in California in the West Coast, which is good news. We see the South East starting to recover and bring us back to the 2019 levels that we spoke to earlier. So I would say those are moving in the right direction. Now the offset to that is long as you've seen the spikes and the hotspots in the Midwest and when that happens in the lockdowns and people are concerned about going into health through delivery, that's going to affect our business. So we've seen some of that, let's say, in the Midwest. And then finally the Northeast and the Northeast including New York and Pennsylvania and going into New England. It's still behind, and it's recovering slowly, but we're the most off, if you will, in the Northeast. So that's the geographic swing. As far as physician business versus hospital business, the hospital business is actually very close to where we were. We're encouraged by that. We see remissions getting back to 2019 levels. We see outpatient procedures getting back to 2019 levels. So that business is tracking nicely compared to where we were. And then the physician side, it all depends on what type of physician. Primary care is starting to turn on oncology, particularly those that have postponed diagnosis and treatment for oncology starting to turn on. And at the same time, we still see our prescription drug monitoring business or mental health and behavioral health and drugs and abuse still down versus where we were at 2019. And that's an issue that varies by state to work in that. So that gives you a feel for what's going geographically. What's going on by physician, but also by what we described as clinical franchises. Mark, anything you'd like to add to that?\nA \u2013 Mark Guinan: No, I think that's a good summary, Steve. Thanks. Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. So thanks, appreciate the question. Mark was encouraging, and we're watching April, carefully. And we do look at the number of test per requisition to see if we're getting more density, if you will, of testing for requisition, and we talked about new made explanation for increase in the calculation of revenue per req have to do with the COVID test, the straight calculation. But we have historically seen a, let's say, modest expansion of the newer test for variety of reasons, we offer more. Second, there is a higher level of acuity and chronic disease and aging of the population. So we have generally seen a general increase in that. But nothing that was really notable that's standing out within March. Hi, Jack. Yeah. So you go back to where we started off the year. What we said is we do expect COVID, PCR testing to decline throughout the year and we mentioned in our remarks, you could see that in Q1, and we see it happening in the country. So as Mark said earlier, we do expect that continuing trend in Q2 and that will continue into the second half. Now with a little bit offset, we do see this transition from what we described as more clinical uses of the PCR testing, roll in and roll out COVID for hospitals, roll in, roll out patients seeing their physicians and moving it to return to life activities, and there's a lot of activity around that, Jack. A lot of activity, I mentioned in the remarks, what's going on around schools. There's two funding mechanisms for that from the U.S. government. We've actively engaged with a number of, let's call it, systems integrators that will be coordinating the efforts beyond the laboratory testing. We're well-positioned there. Secondly, is corporations are now thinking about how they get people back physically into their places of work, maybe albeit not as full-time as they want for. But despite the vaccination progress, they're still going to be testing requirements with the return to work activities. And then let me just say the entertainment piece of this is big, too. We see the sports teams, want to put paints back in the stands. We see New York City, interested in getting people back. The tourism as they get into the fall and turning back on the city, we mentioned in our prior remarks and other calls and meetings that we participated in this pilot study with New York to provide a check, if you will provide access for an individual over the course of the day. So that type of activity will be a larger portion of what we do for COVID testing in the back half. Now with all that said, we're not providing guidance for the back half, but we do see continued PCR testing in the back half, but it's going to change in this nature. And also, we do believe COVID-19 testing and PCR testing will continue in 2022. This is not going away fast. Hey, good morning, Matt. Yeah. Yeah. So first of all, as you know, not all tests are created equal. And PCR still is the gold standard. And we do provide a solution with antigen testing, okay, as part of appropriate utilization of that testing, particularly for surveillance. But as we know, the antigen testing, sensitivity and specificity has been for let's say day two through day five of a potentially infected person. But the PCR test is really the gold standard to rollout, if someone has been exposed in the early days, there were rule out the pick are exposed in the late days. And so the sensitivity and specificity we have with our PCR testing is quite good. And so physician sell that, and therefore, that's why we're so confident that it will continue to be an important part of how we fight this pandemic. As far as the consumer, the consumers trying to figure out to get easy access to testing, and they will get that access in a variety of forms. And by the way, our turnaround time is now for PCR testing are much better on average than the two-ish days that we often thought about several months ago. We're now delivering results in less than the day for many \u2013 for many tests that come in. And the reason for that is, remember the remarks we're testing about 101,000 tests per day, and we have approximately 300,000 per day for capacity. So that allows us to have much better turnaround times, which we believe, as that becomes more and more visible and people want to get good access to the gold standard, they're going to rely on those places they can get access. So we continue our relationships with retailers. We're expanding our relationship with CVS has gone quite well. CVS is active on promoting good access to PCR testing around the drive ends and Walmart as well. And then also with our direct to the Quest capability that we talked about at our Investor Day, we have put on that platform, both PCR testing as well as serology testing. And we are seeing high levels of interest from a consumer perspective of what they could do simply by getting collection kit in the mail and a FedEx envelope to ship that back and good turnaround tied to start up of MyQuest. So that will continue to build, as the consumers -- as we start to return to life in a safe way. I want to be assured that even if they are vaccinated or they have natural immunity, we are not locking into a situation that they might have been exposed in some ways that they fell through the cracks with all the caveats we have with the effectiveness of the vaccines, the questions about natural immunity, and then also, with the new variance as well. So because of that, we keep on working on better and more efficient and easier ways for Americans to get access to PCR testing. And we've got now, I think, a lot of good chance to do that, and that will continue to be an opportunity for us in the back half. Good morning. Hey, Tycho. You're on mute Mark, do you want to talk the ASR? Yeah. Serology, we imply that it will continue at the same level. We are pushing on the value of serology going forward. We believe that the semi-quant capability that we offer has nice insight into what response is happening in patients in general with the virus and therefore, that has value. We also believe that between historic PCR and serology, knowing that you've had the viruses important for Americans to know so. We keep on pushing down the value, and we will continue to look at new tests beyond that. We will be immune response long-term includes T cells. We don't have that, but we continue to look at that has been the prospect. So you should assume for now it's stable with what we've seen so far, but we continue to believe that's more and more valuable in the quarter. We continue to work on developing the test to support that. Mark, you take the first one, I'll take the second one. Yeah. Yeah. Just to transition. So as you recall in our Investor Day, we went to a walk, if you will, to bridge you from the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 into 2022. Mark went through chart with some math, which gave you kind of our indication for 2022. And also, as I said earlier, is we do believe there would be some COVID testing, but the base business will be recovering, and we'll get growing \u2013 going forward in 2022 based upon our outlook. So the last question you add, Rick, you have to deal with the digital front end and digital-first and we're excited about this because we're very well positioned. This isn't something that we have just started working on. We've been working on it for a while. First of all, if you go back to a large provider like Quest, we're very much embedded in the ecosystem of connectivity already. We have over 500 interfaces of all the different electronic medical records, obviously, that's the big players like the Cerner, but there's hundreds of others. And so therefore, we have a real strong interoperability capability. And that's helpful because when you're in the workflow because from a disposition perspective, that allows you to more streamline the different service offerings like laboratory to fewer players. And then secondly is this past year, we've seen the acceptance, if you will of telehealth, it has been growing nicely but out explosively, and we did see explosive growth in 2020 and we believe that overall, that acceptance, if you will, of that front end, be an accepted way to first engage with the healthcare that this system will continue. And the payers are working on that and providers are working on that, and they're working with other partners, and we're very well positioned with those other partners. So who are those partners? Those partners are some of the telehealth companies that you know. And those telehealth companies, as they become much more indebted in healthcare delivery, let's call the digital equipment , will rely on a fewer number of laboratory service providers, and therefore, we're very well positioned as more of a small handful of what just described as the deferred lab network that we are ready with United, but for this new world that we see. And with all that, we do believe that our direct-to-consumer initiative will have an opportunity as well, because consumers equally are wanting to engage with upgrade delivery. They not always need to engage with this physician. And therefore, with the prospects we see of growing that business and the opportunity for consumers to serve themselves, if you will, which is a big opportunity for us. As far as investment, we are investing. We were fortunate enough to have the capabilities in 2020 and 2021. If you again go back to what we shared at Investor Day, we said we're investing about $75 million over a period over the last two years, 2020 and 2021. Some portion of that is related to what we're discussing here. And so, we're not rate limited by investments. We're rate limited by logistics time to get some traction, and we're very well positioned with the telehealth companies, very well positioned with the plans. And yes, we do see a change. And yes, this will allow us, again, to gain share as we go forward, because they can't do this with tens of laboratories, they can only do it with a select group like us. So we have another question? Hi, Derik. Yes. So the first part, yes, we did see an increase in the availability and use of the antigen testing and point-of-care testing throughout the last 12 months that clearly has picked up in the back half of 2020. We see that continue in 2021. So if you look at the industry trackers of how much testing we are doing in this country, clearly, it has dropped off, and therefore, volumes have dropped off as well. We believe in those tracking mechanisms, it's predominantly PCR. However, we think there could be some point-of-care antigen testing in there, but we believe it does not include all the testing that's happening. So if you look at it, look, happy for PCR testing throughout the United States and if you look at the excellence that are coming from least point-of-care and antigen providers, you see that the actual level of testing is almost at the same level that we were in the summer, but in different forms. So the answer to your question is, yes, there is a transition from PCR is exclusively what we have to more of the capabilities around point-of-care and antigen testing. However, going back to what I said, all tests are not created equal. And so we're also working with clients to make sure they realize where antigen testing can be helpful for a period of time. And also what you need to reflex into PCR and where you can use point-of-care and costs are not all created equal. So it has come down because of what we described, but there continues to be a strong role for PCR through the remainder of 2021 and also into 2022. Yeah. Yeah. So what we have been working on as a journey to pick up share, if you will, it can be mated what we shared in March at our Investor Day is we really kicked off the network program in 2019. We saw a good progress there. We're actually very encouraged by what we saw in 2020, it's very early days, and then we have the pandemic. But it didn't stop our activity. So what we shared is we actually picked up some share over that period of time, but we have more share to gain. And there's a list of activities we're working with United to support picking up share and getting it to at least that 25% level, one of which is what we're providing is limiting the other network policy and benefit design for their fully insured book. And where that has happened because we have other examples of the topic, it does move share to us. We don't provide specifics on states and specifics on how much did this contribute to share. But it did have a nice impact for us to allow us to pick up share. And so we continue that market. But I'll also share that we didn't share everything we're doing. There are many other programs, and some of this is working with their plan sponsors. Their employers, some of this is working with their regions, specific opportunities with providers. When we do an outreach purchase and relationship within the geography, whose work on expensive venue to a less expensive venue, which is Quest, and all of those are active relationships that we have to continue to build share with United and other payers is equally will continue to work programs with the Anthem and others. Hello. Mark? Hey, Mark you there?"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mark Guinan",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.72 billion, up 49% versus the prior year. Revenues for diagnostic information services grew approximately 52%, compared to the prior year, which reflected ongoing demand for COVID-19 testing services into a lesser extent continued recovery in our base testing revenue, which increased versus the prior year. Volume, measured by the number of requisitions increased 25.6% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 4%. The impact of severe winter weather during the quarter negatively impacted volumes by approximately 2.5%. Compared to our first quarter 2019 baseline, total base testing volumes increased 1.5% and benefited from M&A and new POS partnerships that began in 2020. Excluding the net impact of weather in the first quarter as well as M&A and new PLS wins over the last year; base testing volumes declined approximately 7% in the first quarter versus the 2019 baseline and down 5% in March. This represents more of a same-store view of the recovery in our base business since the pandemic began. While COVID-19 testing volumes declined faster than expected throughout Q1, the decline coincided with reduced demand across the industry. Importantly, these volumes have stabilized over the last several weeks. We resulted approximately 9.1 million molecular tests and nearly 900,000 serology tests, contributing nearly 21% to volume growth in Q1 versus the prior year. We exited the first quarter averaging approximately 73,000 COVID-19 molecular tests and 8,000 serology tests per day. Sure. So Kevin, when we talk about the base business, and sorry for any confusion, it being up in March. That included our new PLS wins, which were significant and also M&A. So it's the total base business that was not an organic number. What we tried to do was delineate where the -- what we call same-store, so kind of the apples and apples versus 2019 to give you a sense of where we think utilization is. So separate from new significant PLS wins and M&A where that base business performance is. So when we talk about expecting to be slightly down in Q2, that's that organic non-PLS utilization, same store number, not our total base business performance. Yeah. So we talked about 100,000 a day in Q1. We talked about an expectation about 50,000, we also shared that we exited Q1 over 70,000, so that would imply a significant ramp down throughout the second quarter. And that's based on our expectation that vaccines will continue to roll out, we'll get more and more people who'll be protected and less and less clinical demand. And of course, we'll see how that plays out, but that is certainly within the guidance that we're providing today, how we see the next several months. Yeah. And just to close it out, Kevin, I would point to the numbers that we quoted for Q1 of minus 7%. That's the same-store performance number. And we -- obviously, March was stronger than that. February was impacted by weather, as we said. But that -- we expect that minus 7% to improve, as Steve said, throughout Q2, but not yet to get positive. Hey, Steve, let me take the guidance question first, and then I'll turn it over to you. So Erin, our current guidance, obviously, is only through the second quarter, and we're not counting on any M&A that hasn't already been transacted. And even the deal that we announced Mercy is not going to close and generate any significant volume or revenue in the second quarter. So the current guidance does not anticipate future M&A. Steve? Yeah. And Steve, I'd like to add. I want to make sure that Matt and others understand how the surveillance works. And in this case, when you pool you get the economics to where it's affordable to do more broadly and more regularly, because we're going to be putting up to 10 individual samples in a single well. And so hence, the cost will be 10% or less per individual. And what you sacrifice is, it's not a diagnostic, because we're not going to have the individuals identified in that well. The school or the entity that provides us the sample will have tool that they will know in test through that who the 10 people are. And if we come back to them with a positive result, they will apply a real diagnostic to those 10 individuals. So with that, we also don't have the obligation or the ability to retest. Whereas today, when we do pooling for clinical purposes, if we get a positive, we have to go back and retest the individual samples, so it actually is an inefficiency in our process. In order to get this to work, we don't do retesting of a sample. We don't have the capability of doing that. We notify the submitting entity that we had a positive in one of the pooled collection specimen tubes, and then they go forward and test those individuals. Tycho, you're on mute. Well, the ASR is in our updated guidance. So there's not upside per se relative to before we announced the ASR, as I tried to walk through the math, about a little less than $400 million of the repurchases are truly incremental in terms of an EPS lift, because we had already committed to the full $900 million, and we had about $500 million remaining in Q2 that was already in the guidance. So that $1.5 billion goes down to $1 billion incremental. A little over $600 million of that is the proceeds from our divestiture of our stake in Q2, that's slightly accretive. But not materially relative to the -- for mature of the equity earnings there. So it's really less than $400 million of share repurchases that were incremental to what we guided to previously. And that is built into the updated guidance. In terms of implied operating margin, obviously, we have a range. So we can't answer that with precision. But if you take the midpoint, you can all do the math. As we get a lower mix of COVID testing at our assumption of the $100 reimbursement, obviously, realization in AWR that's less than that, $100 price point. And that mix is toward the base business that will erode the margin slightly. But the offset to that is the base business recovers, we're very leveraged. So the variable drop-through on that base business recovery, certainly much higher than our enterprise and historical fully loaded operating margin, but it's not quite as high as the COVID PCR. Sure, Steve. Thanks for the Ricky. Again, just to reiterate, the first half, we delivered over 100,000 PCR COVID tests per day. We're assuming half that in Q2. So that's certainly contributing to the margin decline, as you talked about, implied in the guidance for the first half, implicitly in Q2. When you think about the base business, we're still uncertain how all those moving parts will play out in the second half, which is why we've not provided second half guidance that we want to wait until we can confidently give guidance that we're highly confident will be delivered. So what I would point to is that's the transition period, really look at an Investor Day and how we talked about 2022. And talking about getting our base business fully recovered by the end of this year, back to growth through the growth pillars and back to a margin level, pre-pandemic and then obviously improving beyond that, as we talked about a CAGR where our bottom line grows significantly faster than our top line by 700 basis points. So we feel very confidence in the earnings power of the base business. Certainly, we're going to have a step down from the pandemic bubble, where we did several billion dollars of COVID testing last year, and significant COVID testing this year. But the base business should be very healthy coming out of the pandemic once COVID testing drops to a minimal level. We'll be right back to the operating rhythm. Our expectation is that you saw early in 2019 when we were growing a business January, February, more than 5% on a volume basis, and you saw strong improvements in our operating margin. Steve? Yeah. So the -- what I would say is, I'm not in a position to update that what we provided at Investor Day, because we could get in a rhythm of constantly getting asked to update that. So next time we'll comment will be when we provide guidance for 2022. But of course, as we have that broader range, there's a lot of different considerations, what the remaining level of COVID testing, what's the reimbursement level. Where is the base business at? When we gave the $7.48, as we said, we're expecting the base business to be fully recovered this year to be back to 2019 baseline and starting to grow. But depending on the pace of some of these initiatives that are being rolled out by several payers, not just United by Anthem and some of the other major players depending on the economy, depending on, obviously, potential expansion of covered lives. There's a lot of variables that we'll know a lot more about by the end of the year before we give guidance for 2022. So stronger recovery of the base business, good fact, I wouldn't say at this point that, the faster decline in COVID testing yet necessarily implies anything for 2022 around our comments. Because we assumed it would still be around, and you heard from others as well. Nobody thinks is going away. And we were not expecting it to be anywhere near the significance that it was in 2020 and in 2021. So \u2013 and then you've got the ASR we just announced. So there's a lot of different moving pieces. So we'll give you an update on 2022, when we provide our guidance for 2022. We just wanted to ground people at Investor Day, because the pandemic really confounded everyone's ability to understand our long-term earnings power, and that's why we thought it was important to make a specific comment on 2022."

Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.\nJim Davis: Thanks Shawn, and good morning everyone. Quest had a strong year in 2022 with base business revenues growing more than 6% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. As we expected COVID-19 testing revenues declined but still exceeded $1.4 billion in 2022. Our strong performance over the last several years would not have been possible without the commitment and compassion of our nearly 50,000 colleagues who rose to the challenge of COVID-19 while growing our base business. I am incredibly proud of how this team has worked together during an unprecedented period in the lab industry to deliver insights to help create a healthier world. This morning, I\u2019ll discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our 2023 guidance. In the fourth quarter, total revenues were $2.3 billion, earnings per share were $0.87 on a reported basis and $1.98 on an adjusted basis, cash from operations was $334 million. For the full year 2022, total revenues were $9.9 billion, including more than $8.4 billion in base business revenue. Earnings per share were $7.97 on a reported basis and $9.95 on an adjusted basis. Cash from operations was $1.7 billion. As you saw this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend approximately 8% to $0.71 per share and increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion.  Before discussing additional highlights for 2022, I\u2019d like to share some recent positive regulatory updates. First, Congress delayed Medicare reimbursement cuts under PAMA that were scheduled to take place in 2023, which would have impacted our revenue between approximately $80 million and $85 million. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to work closely with our trade association to seek a permanent fix to PAMA. Second, CMS increased Medicare reimbursement for specimen collection fees for the first time in nearly 40 years. This could provide Quest with a benefit of approximately $35 million to $40 million this year. Regarding COVID-19 testing revenues, while we did see a steady ramp upward in COVID-19 volumes throughout Q4, our volumes have steadily declined since late December. We expect our COVID-19 revenues to be significantly lower in 2023 compared to 2022. We have lowered our prior COVID-19 volume expectations in 2023 from 10,000 to 15,000 molecular tests per day to 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day. In addition, we continue to negotiate coverage and reimbursement policies with commercial payors following the end of the PHE in May. I will now share some recent highlights in how we are growing this business. In the fourth quarter, we completed our acquisition of the outreach laboratory services business of Suma Health, a large integrated health system serving communities in northeastern Ohio. We also entered into an agreement to acquire select assets of Northern Light Health\u2019s outreach laboratory services business located in Maine. We will also provide professional laboratory management services for nine of Northern Light\u2019s hospital laboratories along with its cancer center lab. Our M&A pipeline is strong, including potential deals with health systems, small regional labs, and other capability-building assets. In particular, the funnel of opportunities with health systems, which are facing major margin pressures due to labor challenges and mix shift from inpatient to outpatient care, is very active. Quest can help through lab management, population health analytics, mobile services, and/or by monetizing their outreach business. In health plans, we continue to gain traction with value-based contracts where we see meaningfully higher growth than with traditional contracts. Also, we\u2019ve started to benefit from incentives related to these value-based contracts which helps demonstrate the value of these strategic relationships. With CMS\u2019 recent increase in Medicare reimbursement for specimen collections, we\u2019ve begun discussions with our health plan customers about getting paid appropriately for the phlebotomy services we provide to their members. Higher specimen collection fees enable us to make continuous investment in patient services so their members continue to have the broadest access to high quality and low cost lab testing. In advanced diagnostics, we generated strong double-digit growth in prenatal genetics and pharma services in 2022. In 2022, we also launched a solid tumor expanded panel as a laboratory-developed test. This 523 gene test relies upon the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 assay to help oncologists with therapy selection by providing comprehensive genomic profiling of a patient\u2019s tumor. This test extends our capabilities beyond tissue pathology to offer faster turnaround time from cancer diagnosis to therapy selection. Throughout 2022, we continued to make investments to strengthen our bio-informatics capabilities which support some of the faster growing opportunities of our portfolio, like genomic sequencing services, prenatal and hereditary genetic testing, and pharma services. We also invested in our women\u2019s health sales force which will position us well for continued strong growth in prenatal genetics.  We continue to make progress executing our consumer initiated testing strategy. Last year, we recorded approximately $96 million of both base and COVID-19 consumer testing. In the fall of 2022, we launched our new digital platform, QuestHealth.com. Consumers have found this to be a simpler, more intuitive way to order lab tests. Following the launch of our new consumer sight, we began ramping up marketing spend through the fourth quarter. We saw some of the strongest order volumes to date following some Cyber Monday promotional advertising, and we are encouraged by the acceleration of growth in base testing in December. Shifting to operational excellence, in 2022 we approached our goal of 3% productivity improvements and savings through our Invigorate program. Those savings and productivity improvements did not completely offset the inflationary pressures in our business, as well as the impact of a modest unit price decline. Following the pandemic, we like many companies have faced significant inflation and wage pressures. We are increasing our efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in our base business.  We continue to drive additional productivity improvements with lab platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence. Last year, we began a new automation conversion project in our Lenexa laboratory. This new project builds on what work we\u2019ve done in our Marlborough and Clifton labs. We\u2019ve introduced a new microbiology platform that is highly automated and makes use of artificial intelligence to assist with sample analysis. Finally, we\u2019ve begun to realize savings from the urinalysis platform conversion that we announced early last year.  Filling and retaining our frontline positions continues to be a key priority for us. Although we have experienced higher than average turnover in some of our job categories, we have taken actions to stabilize our workforce and improve frontline employee engagement and retention. We expect these actions to help enhance our productivity in 2023. We have also taken actions to reduce our SG&A by approximately $100 million in 2023, including workforce reductions of approximately 1.5% primarily in corporate support functions. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2023 guidance. Sam?\nSam Samad: Thanks Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.33 billion, down 15% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 6.3% to $2.15 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 75% to $184 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 15.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 11.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 with acquisitions contributing 20 basis points to total volume.  For the quarter, total base testing volumes declined 0.6% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to lower employer drug testing volume and adverse weather events during the quarter, which together represented a volume headwind of more than 1.5%.  COVID-19 testing volumes contributed to the decline during the fourth quarter. We resulted approximately 1.9 molecular tests in the quarter. This was down 1.2 million tests versus the third quarter and down approximately 5.4 million tests versus Q4 of 2021. After rising modestly throughout the fourth quarter, our COVID-19 molecular volumes declined to an average of roughly 17,000 tests per day in January and currently make up less than 3% of our daily volumes. In the fourth quarter, revenue per requisition declined 5.1% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 6.8%. This strong increase in revenue per req was driven by a number of factors, including test and payor mix, the more favorable pricing environment with health plans, including incentives under our value-based contracts, and lower patient concessions. Unit price reimbursement pressure remained consistent with our expectations at approximately 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $135 million or 5.8% of revenues compared to $536 million or 19.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $330 million or 14.2% of revenues compared to $579 million or 21.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues and to a lesser extent the negative impact of adverse weather on our volume, as well as higher investments to accelerate growth in our base business. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we experienced a significant increase in employee healthcare costs.  Reported EPS was $0.87 in the fourth quarter compared to $3.12 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.98 compared to $3.33 last year. Cash from operations was $1.72 billion for full year 2022 versus $2.23 billion in the prior year period.  Turning to our full year 2023 guidance, revenues are expected to be between $8.83 billion and $9.03 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.65 billion and $8.75 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $175 million and $275 million. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.61 to $8.21, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.40 to $9. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.  For our 2023 guidance, please consider the following. As Jim highlighted, we are now assuming COVID-19 molecular volumes to average roughly 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day for the full year. We expect volumes to continue to decline through the spring and summer but could see a modest uptick during respiratory season in Q4. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to continue near recent levels through the end of the PHE.  CMS has indicated that reimbursements will be $51 when the PHE expires in May. We continue to negotiate with health plans regarding coverage policies and reimbursements for COVID-19 testing post-PHE. Note that our COVID-19 testing revenue guidance for 2023 is approximately $150 million lower than the expectations we had back in October. With COVID-19 testing becoming a significantly smaller portion of our overall business, we expect an earnings cadence that is more in line with pre-pandemic seasonality this year, with Q1 typically being the lowest quarter of the year at roughly 22% to 23% of full year earnings.  We have also taken actions to reduce our SG&A by approximately $100 million in 2023, including workforce reductions of approximately 1.5% primarily in corporate support functions. The benefit of these actions will be modest in Q1 and will expand in the second quarter.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.\nJim Davis: Thanks Sam. To summarize, we delivered strong growth of 5% in our base business in 2022. COVID testing revenues as expected declined last year and will represent a significantly smaller portion of our business going forward. We are increasing our efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in our base business. We look forward to sharing more of our strategy during our upcoming investor day on March 16 at the New York Stock Exchange. Look for an announcement soon with more details on this event. Now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] The first question in the queue is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. \nAnn Hynes: Hi, good morning. Thank you.  Maybe if we talk about major assumptions in the low end of guidance versus what\u2019s embedded in the high end of guidance. Can you also discuss the incremental $115 million to $125 million that is now benefiting 2023 versus when you reiterated that mid-$8 range back in Q3 earnings? How much has fallen to the bottom line, and how much do you expect to reinvest in the business? Thanks. \nJim Davis: Yes, let me just speak first about the revenue guidance. As we indicated in the remarks, our COVID guidance, which had originally been 10,000 to 15,000 requisitions per day in \u201923, we\u2019ve revised that downward to 5,000 to 10,000 per day, and it\u2019s really just based on the trends we\u2019re seeing. It peaked in December. We averaged roughly 17,000 a day here in January, but that\u2019s had a downward slope, so we continue to expect COVID volumes to decline and it\u2019s really had about $150 million change in revenue versus what we thought last fall. Again, the guidance we\u2019ve suggested - you know, a midpoint of about $225 million in COVID revenue for the year. On the base business, without acquisition help, we\u2019ve assumed a 2.5% to 3% revenue growth on the total base business, so really that\u2019s the explanation on the revenue side.\nSam Samad: Yes, so maybe I\u2019ll add a couple of comments, Ann, and thank you for the question - this is Sam.  Versus what we shared back when we talked about in Q3 of 2022 around the fact that we were somewhere in that 850 range, obviously some positives that you mentioned, which is I think what you are referring to as the $115 million to $125 million, which includes the PAMA delay, which includes also the reimbursement of the specimen collection fees, which we now benefit from. But there are a couple of things also that have changed to the negative, really the key one being--or just one thing, really, that\u2019s changed to the negative, I should say, which is COVID.  The COVID assumptions that we had back then were, as Jim just said, 10,000 to 15,000 a day. Now we\u2019re seeing volumes, as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, 17,000 a day in January, and January is typically around the peak of the respiratory season and then it starts to come down from there, so our expectations of 10,000 to 15,000 a day for the year are, I would say, realistic. But in terms of the range itself and what differentiates the bottom versus the top, I think it\u2019s going to be really around the COVID assumptions. But again, keep in mind we\u2019ve taken COVID down by $150 million in terms of total revenues versus what we really shared back in October, when we expected 10,000 to 15,000. We\u2019ve also--from the benefit itself, you know, the $115 million to $125 million that you referenced, we\u2019ve also carved out a small amount for investments in the business, strategic investments that, as we said a couple of months ago, we said we will reserve some of that benefit to invest in the business for long term growth.\nAnn Hynes: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Sam, maybe one for you. Margins came in a little light of where we were expecting 4Q. Can you just talk about the puts and takes there between DTC growth investments, inflation, pricing; and then going into \u201923, it seems like the base business margins need to step up - you know, you called out the $100 million SG&A cut. Are you guys changing any plans for DTC investments? Just want to get comfortable with that margin bridge from the lower 4Q number and the moving pieces. Thank you. \nSam Samad: Sure Patrick, yes, and thank you for the question. Let me talk a little bit about Q4 and the margin rate in Q4, the 14.2%. Here are some of the headwinds, some of which we were seeing throughout the year, but obviously we also had a drop in COVID revenues in Q4 which was significant versus Q3, at least sequentially, which impacted the margin as well.  In terms of the margin rate itself, we had inflation, I would say per expectations but still elevated. We had growth investments of roughly about $40 million that impacted Q4, which were fairly in line with Q3, what we had in terms of investments, so not necessarily a sequential driver. One driver in Q4 that impacted our margin rate was higher employee healthcare cost. That was higher than our expectations and some of it driven by higher utilization, especially towards the end of the year after employees have met their deductibles, but also higher cost of healthcare in general. That was about 80 basis points of impact on the quarter in terms of negative rate impact, so that was another thing. I talked about--obviously if you\u2019re looking at things sequentially, you have to factor in that COVID revenues were $184 million roughly versus approximately $313 million in Q3, so a big drop in COVID revenues. Now if you look prospectively in 2023, here are some of the things that obviously give us confidence that we can achieve the rate that we have in our projections and that\u2019s factored into the guidance that we gave. We have taken $100 million in SG&A reductions, and I would say 90% of those have already been implemented. Now, you won\u2019t see the benefit starting in Q1, you\u2019ll probably see it in the latter part of Q1 and really taking effect in Q2 more fully, but that\u2019s $100 million in SG&A reductions that we expect to see over the course of this year. In terms of investments, you referenced that, we expect investments to be less dilutive in 2023 versus 2022, because we start to see the benefit from some of these investments towards the growth of our business. Then finally, obviously the margin rate is going to benefit from the specimen collection fee reimbursement that we have, and we have a volume growth assumption as well and a revenue growth assumption that at the midpoint of the guidance range is, on base business, approximately 3%, and so that\u2019s going to drive also additional margin improvement based on the drop-down from those revenues.\nPatrick Donnelly: That\u2019s helpful, thanks Sam.\nSam Samad: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, good morning. I had a few questions on Quest Health. First, of the $96 million you talked about of sales, is there a breakdown you can share of COVID versus base; then second, on the base sales, how did that ramp after the fall push? Then finally, just what are your expectations for consumer initiated testing revenue and investment for 2023?\nJim Davis: Yes, so Jack, let me start. On CIT, our consumer initiated testing business, the total $96 million, more of it was COVID than our base business; however, our base business, once we launched the new platform, once we launched the marketing spend actually performed as expected in November and December. We got significant growth year-over-year, over 50% growth in the month of December based on the initiatives we put in place.  As we\u2019ve said, this year we expect that business to be less dilutive versus 2022. In terms of the total revenue projection for CIT, you know, we\u2019ll give you something at investor day. Obviously COVID will significantly ramp down, but we expect our base to significantly ramp up, and we\u2019ll give you a better view of that at investor day.\nJack Meehan: Great, and then one follow-up on COVID. If we do a look back on 2022, is it possible to call out how much of the sales came from serology, your CDC contract or anything outside of the core molecular, and just what you\u2019re assuming there for 2023?\nJim Davis: Here\u2019s what I\u2019d say. As we indicated, the volume is coming down, right - we said 10 to 15 last fall, we now expect 5 to 10 for the year. The one thing I\u2019ll say on serology, we had a significant contract with the CDC, it was simply a test add-on seroprevalence study. That contract, as expected, ended in December. The CDC just doesn\u2019t need that information anymore. What does remain, in addition to the PCR volume, is we\u2019ve got a roughly $25 million contract with the CDC to do continuous sequencing work of the positive cases to help inform the CDC and others about the spread or development of new variants that continue to pop up.\nJack Meehan: Super, thank you Jim.\nJim Davis: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nAJ Rice: Yes, hi everybody. Thanks. Obviously there continues to be a steady pipeline of hospital-related deals. Can you tell us whether--I know your closest peer is announcing transactions too. Do you see any change in the competitive landscape for those deals, on the terms on which those deals are being done? You also mentioned seeing some more activity in small regional labs. What do you attribute that to - is it COVID testing is as running off, are you seeing some of the regional labs express more interest in potentially aligning with you?\nJim Davis: Yes AJ, thanks for the question. I would tell you no, there\u2019s no real change in the competitive dynamic in terms of pursuit of these hospital outreach deals or professional lab services types of engagements. What I would tell you is the funnel is as big as it\u2019s ever been. We expect to close several deals here in the first half of the year, so still feel very good about that.  In terms of small regional labs that are out there, first I\u2019d say there\u2019s not that many left out there that are of significant size. Certainly those that participated in COVID testing, and now that that volume is declining, yes, we are seeing a few raise their hands and put up the retirement flag and potentially sell out, so we look at each and every one of them. If we think it adds to our competitive position in a certain geographic marketplace, we\u2019ll look at it. If we don\u2019t think we need it from a competitive standpoint, then we take a bye on those.\nAJ Rice: Okay, thanks a lot.\nJim Davis: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nPito Chickering: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Quest has a very long track record of finding cost efficiencies through Invigorate, so I\u2019m curious how the SG&A cost cutting of $100 million compares to what Invigorate usually finds in SG&A, or most cost savings via Invigorate usually done and cost of services and fixed cost leverage on volume. \nJim Davis: Yes, so first, the $100 million cost takeout is incremental to our Invigorate plan for 2023. With our Invigorate plan, we target roughly 3% of our entire cost base for the company, so call that $6.4 billion-ish, 3%, call it $180 million, $190 million a year. We actually got very close to that target in 2022. As we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, it did not completely offset wage inflation and the slight price headwind that we did see, along with just other non-labor inflationary pressures. Now as we go into 2023, we\u2019ve got a full funnel of productivity ideas, productivity initiatives that we\u2019re driving through the company. I would say the other thing that we think will really help us in 2023 is simply the stabilization of our workforce. Attrition has a really major impact on your productivity when you\u2019re constantly churning phlebotomists, logistics and specimen processing, so that has stabilized, it\u2019s coming down. We feel good about it and we feel good about the overall productivity plan in terms of offsetting inflation, which we expect to be slightly softer, easier in 2023, and we expect price all-in across Quest Diagnostics to actually be a positive for 2023.\nSam Samad: At the risk of being redundant here, I\u2019m still going to repeat something from what Jim said at the beginning, because it\u2019s really important for all your assumptions. The productivity improvements and the Invigorate actions, which is the 3% that we expect to get, that\u2019s in addition on top of the $100 million of SG&A reductions that we\u2019ve already taken for the most part.\nPito Chickering: Got it, and sorry, two quick follow-ups. You talked about phlebotomists. Just curious where the phlebotomist hourly wage is today and if you think is the right level to compete against retail channels. The second one is the public lab supply companies have been talking about pricing for a while. Just curious as one of the largest labs in the U.S., what you assume for supply inflation for \u201923, or can you offset that inflation simply by changing vendors and/or leveraging your scale?\nJim Davis: Yes, so our phlebotomy rates vary by region of the country. What I would tell you is our increase in wages for phlebotomy were certainly in line with the 3% to 4% wage impact that we saw last year. It\u2019s what we\u2019re planning for 2023, and as I indicated, our retention has improved. Our attrition has certainly stabilized and declined, so we feel good about that.\nPito Chickering: Then on the supply inflation, just curious--?\nJim Davis: Yes, I\u2019m sorry, the supply inflation. Again, 70% of what we purchase each year is under contract. When those contracts come up, they generally represent an opportunity for deflation, meaning we\u2019re going to run a competition between the vendors and we look for improvements from a cost, quality and turnaround time perspective. Where the inflation hit us in 2022 is really on some of the non-supplies, the reagents and things like that. Some of that could have been pre-analytical supplies, masks, gowns, things like that, as well as just the normal inflation that you all see in your businesses, which could be hotels, air travel and things like that. Now again, we think that\u2019s softening here as we get into 2023, and we certainly put guardrails on travel and living expenses and things like that.\nPito Chickering: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning guys. Jim, just a quick question on rates from payors. I think in the past, you\u2019ve expressed some optimism in seeing a little bit of rate improvement in the commercial side. But I think in your prepared remarks, you called out a little bit of reimbursement pressure at 60 basis points or so, so just curious how do we reconcile that, and maybe just broadly speaking what you\u2019re seeing in terms of payor receptivity to increasing rates on the reimbursement front. Thanks. \nJim Davis: Yes, I think we said in the prepared remarks that our pricing was down about 50 basis points, which actually represents the best that I\u2019ve seen in my time with Quest Diagnostics, so we feel good about that. We\u2019ve also said that as we renegotiate new contracts, and every one of these contracts is four to five years in length so you can expect that 20% to 25% will renew this year, which they will, and the preponderance of those contracts we\u2019ve seen rate increases at a minimum rate--you know, holding rate flat to prior contracts, so we view that as a very positive. What we\u2019ve also said is, look - we\u2019ve got a $35 million to $40 million rate increase through Medicare draw fee increases, and today we get reimbursed on roughly 25% of the commercial draws that we do. We\u2019re going to push hard not only to expand that 25% but those that do reimburse us to take those rates up as well, so we are pushing hard at every turn to increase prices across this business. The last thing I\u2019d say is, look, there\u2019s a portfolio of $700 million to $800 million of other businesses in Quest Diagnostics - that can be our Exam One business, our employer solutions business, our employee population health business, and we\u2019ve pushed for 2% to 3% price increases on that portfolio of business and we\u2019ve largely gotten those in place for 2023. Again, this is the most optimistic price outlook that we\u2019ve put forward since I joined Quest in 2013.\nSam Samad: Yes, maybe just to put a couple of points of emphasis around it, in the prepared remarks we talked about a price impact in Q4 of roughly 50 basis points year-over-year of price headwind. As we look towards 2023, what\u2019s reflected in our guidance right now is actually a positive price impact year-over-year, and obviously that\u2019s benefited from the reimbursement of the specimen collection fee. It\u2019s definitely a positive. We\u2019ve managed to really make some good progress in terms of our pricing. \nJim Davis: The other thing I want to mention is we\u2019ve talked about these value-based contracts, and over 30% of our health plan contracts have some type of incentive for us to earn additional value, which we actually don\u2019t put into the price equation, but it\u2019s really good payor mix. These incentives could be based on share of spend with Quest Diagnostics, it could be based on leakage, it could be based on the movement of requisitions from high priced hospital labs into laboratories like Quest Diagnostics, so those value-based incentives are an important part of our business, and as we succeed in achieving that value for the health plans, there\u2019s rewards that come back to us.\nShawn Bevec: Brian, this is Shawn. Just one last thing I wanted to add. Most of the price impact that we saw in 2022 was largely driven by some of the client bill, largely with the hospitals. The health plan book was actually pretty good, pretty stable, so.\nBrian Tanquilut: Got it. Very helpful, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m really just trying to understand all these puts and takes a little bit. I guess my first one is, is the $100 million of SG&A, it\u2019s incremental. Is that--you know, Invigorate typically offsets some other inflationary pressures, labor costs and the like. Is this $100 million incremental such that it drops to the bottom line, or are there other offsets there? Two, is there any change with the pricing benefit that you\u2019re talking about, better pricing is certainly a tailwind, I would think for \u201923, so how do we think about that in terms of--or is there an offset there on mix on the margin for, basically, your volume mix, something to that effect? I\u2019m just trying to understand the puts and takes.\nJim Davis: Yes, again the $100 million, it is incremental to our Invigorate plan of record, and yes, it drops right to the bottom line. In terms of pricing, no, the improvement drops to the bottom line as well. We\u2019re not suggesting any other offset at this point. Obviously we had strong [indiscernible] both in Q4 and for the year. That benefit, we would put in three buckets: test mix, which was very positive for the year; we saw a big surge of flu and RSV testing along with COVID, but flu and RSV that came in Q4, that has since moderated; and then our business mix was good in terms of payor mix. Then finally, year-over-year we made nice improvements in patient concessions, so our ability to collect, our ability to reduce denials and get paid for the work we do was certainly a positive tailwind for us in 2022.\nKevin Caliendo: And if I can just ask one quick follow-up, should we assume in our models the billion dollar buyback gets used in 2023?\nSam Samad: No, Kevin. The billion dollar share authorization increase, that\u2019s in addition to the $311 million that we currently have on the previous authorization, but you should not expect that that is what\u2019s assumed in the guidance. What we\u2019ve assumed, actually, is that any share buybacks we do are to offset equity dilution, so essentially the share count is roughly flat with where we are at the end of the year, so don\u2019t assume the $1 billion to be built into the projections.\nKevin Caliendo: Very helpful, thank you guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Brackmann with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Brackmann: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.  Maybe as it relates specifically to COVID test reimbursement with the PHE ending, maybe just give us a little more detail on how those conversations with commercial payors are trending and how we should be thinking about expectations there. Then I guess just related to that, how are you thinking about any permanent changes to your respiratory testing portfolio broadly, now that we\u2019ve lived through three years of COVID? Thanks.\nJim Davis: Yes, so again, CMS--and we\u2019ve had direct discussions with them, it\u2019s very clear that once the public health emergency ends, the rate will go to $51. We are certainly expecting and driving those discussions with commercial payors that we expect that rate to be $51 as well. It\u2019s a new test that should be treated as such. Some may have a slightly different opinion on that, Andrew, so that\u2019s where we negotiate. In addition to that, there\u2019s coverage policy decisions that all need to be worked out as well, asymptomatic versus symptomatic testing, so we\u2019re bullish that the country needs these tests, commercial payors need these tests, and we\u2019re going to drive these discussions in the most favorable way that we can. In terms of respiratory panels, obviously with COVID still out there, it\u2019s not going to go away in 2023. When patients presented in the fall, winter and here in January with respiratory symptoms, some physicians ordered three tests, some physicians ordered one and then re-flexed to others, depending on if the first one turned out to be negative, so there were a variety of patterns that were out there. But you know, we don\u2019t expect COVID to go away in 2023, so whether RSV and flu tick up like they did in 2022 remains to be seen, and so we\u2019ll just have to see how it plays out in the late fall, early winter.\nOperator: The next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik de Bruin: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. One quick housekeeping question and then a follow-up. The housekeeping question, just expectations for net interest expense for the year, and then how should we think--and also then, how should we think about the M&A contribution that\u2019s embedded in your revenue and your volume growth in the \u201923 guide, and should we still think about that 2% bogey at the way to look at it for going forward on the revenue contribution? Thanks.\nSam Samad: Yes, so I\u2019ll handle the questions, but I missed the part on the expense. What type of expense?\nDerik de Bruin: I\u2019m sorry - net interest expense.\nSam Samad: Oh, net interest expense - okay. That\u2019s roughly flat, I\u2019d say year-over-year in terms of \u2018222 to \u201923, Derik, is the assumption to take there.  In terms of M&A, what we have assumed in our guide for 2023 is really no material prospective M&A, so essentially what\u2019s closed already, what was included in \u201923 in terms of deals that have been made - any outreach, for instance, hospital deals that have already closed in \u201922, those you\u2019ll see a benefit from in \u201923, but there is no prospective M&A included. When you think about our long term target that we had talked about, around 2% contribution from M&A, we have not assumed any prospective M&A in \u201923 on top of our base revenue growth.\nDerik de Bruin: All right, so with completed M&A, then what\u2019s the contribution for \u201923?\nSam Samad: It\u2019s not significant. We\u2019re not going to give the exact contribution, but it\u2019s really not that material in terms of what we have this year that carries into next year.\nShawn Bevec: Derik, we had one month of Pac Health, because that\u2019s what closed last year at the end of January, and then the Suma Health and the Northern Light outreach acquisitions, those were pretty small.\nDerik de Bruin: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The last question in the queue is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. I had a question about advanced diagnostics and your assumptions for \u201923, including contribution and then more specifically on the positive impact in pricing, and any kind of incremental investments that you think specifically for 2023 will be necessary to sustain that growth, accelerate it.\nJim Davis: Yes, so we\u2019ve talked about our investments in really three categories. First, consumer initiated testing, which we covered, that business will continue to grow on the base side of our testing in 2023, and as we\u2019ve indicated, it will certainly be less dilutive than it was in 2022.  The second big area of investments has been in oncology and what we call genomic sequencing services, and really building out what we call our integrated genomics platform. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we brought up a new LDT in Q4 using the Illumina platform - it\u2019s referred to as the TSO 500, but it is a Quest LDT, and it\u2019s really important in therapy selection decisions for cancer. We\u2019re really happy about that. We brought it up at our SJC facility and we\u2019ll be expanding that to a second facility here in early 2023, so we certainly expect that business to grow.  On this integrated genomics platform, look - the world has moved from micro array testing to whole exome to whole transcriptome, and now moving quickly to whole genome testing, and we expect with this platform to have a really good sample to complete information platform, low cost, high throughput, really good turnaround time, and we\u2019ll update you more about that at our upcoming investor day. The final thing is--you know, we referred to it as pharma services, which grew over 15% last year, and this is us participating in companion diagnostics. We participate in phase 1 clinical trials, either from a pharma company or from a CRO, and then we do a lot of testing and validation work for our IVD partners in the industry, and that business continues to grow as well.  The last thing I\u2019d say is, look, we felt really good about our growth in prenatal testing this year and other rare genetic disorders, so it\u2019s a business that continues to grow in the high single, low double digits for Quest Diagnostics.\nOperator: There is one more question that popped in the queue from Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. Thanks guys for taking the question. First up, we\u2019ve previously talked about some of the uneven recoveries by geography. Last quarter, you noted that New York City was still not fully recovered, so can you just give us the latest update on the recovery there in New York? Then my follow-up is just on the analyst day this March, can you walk us through some of the topics that you plan on hitting on, any expectations for that? Thanks.\nSam Samad: Yes, thank you, Rachel, for the question - this is Sam. In terms of the geography, I think it\u2019s consistent with what we said before, and let me repeat what we said because we haven\u2019t seen really a major change in the dynamic yet. We are back to pre-pandemic levels and above across most geographies, the notable exception being the east, where New York City, I think we\u2019ve seen roughly 3% to 5% outflow from the city in terms of population, 3% to 5% of the population leaving the city. We haven\u2019t seen that fully come back yet, even though the city is much more vibrant and there\u2019s more activity. But I don\u2019t think in terms of people coming back and getting health care in New York City, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s back to where it was pre-pandemic by any means. The other thing we look at is ridership on public transportation as an indicator, as a key metric to see how is that also coming back, and it\u2019s still about 35% or so below pre-pandemic levels in terms of ridership, based on the last data points that we got. The punch line here being that the east is still lagging, but everywhere else is above pre-pandemic levels in terms of utilization. \nJim Davis: Yes, and then Rachel, thanks for the question on investor day. I think there\u2019s really four broad topics that we\u2019re going to talk about. First around growth, we\u2019ll go deep on what we\u2019re doing from an oncology and genomic sequencing standpoint. We\u2019ll give you a lot more color on our consumer initiated testing business, the progress we\u2019re making and why we continue to be excited about that, and then we\u2019ll also address the core part of this business, which is serving physicians, serving health systems, and what we\u2019re doing to continue to drive growth in those segments. Finally and as always, we\u2019ll address what we\u2019re doing to improve the customer experience and drive productivity in this business. It\u2019s a never-ending part of what we do and we continue to drive productivity, and we\u2019ll give you our plans for \u201923 and beyond. Finally, just as a reminder, it is March 16, it will be at the New York Stock Exchange, and we\u2019ll obviously provide our long term outlook as part of that session.\nOperator: I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue. \nJim Davis: Okay, so I wanted to thank everybody for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing you all on March 16 at the New York Stock Exchange, and have a great afternoon. Thanks everyone.\nSam Samad: Thank you everybody.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics fourth quarter and full year 2022 conference call.

            "name": "Sam Samad",
            "content": "Thanks Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.33 billion, down 15% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 6.3% to $2.15 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 75% to $184 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 15.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 11.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 with acquisitions contributing 20 basis points to total volume.  For the quarter, total base testing volumes declined 0.6% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to lower employer drug testing volume and adverse weather events during the quarter, which together represented a volume headwind of more than 1.5%.  COVID-19 testing volumes contributed to the decline during the fourth quarter. We resulted approximately 1.9 molecular tests in the quarter. This was down 1.2 million tests versus the third quarter and down approximately 5.4 million tests versus Q4 of 2021. After rising modestly throughout the fourth quarter, our COVID-19 molecular volumes declined to an average of roughly 17,000 tests per day in January and currently make up less than 3% of our daily volumes. In the fourth quarter, revenue per requisition declined 5.1% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 6.8%. This strong increase in revenue per req was driven by a number of factors, including test and payor mix, the more favorable pricing environment with health plans, including incentives under our value-based contracts, and lower patient concessions. Unit price reimbursement pressure remained consistent with our expectations at approximately 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $135 million or 5.8% of revenues compared to $536 million or 19.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $330 million or 14.2% of revenues compared to $579 million or 21.1% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues and to a lesser extent the negative impact of adverse weather on our volume, as well as higher investments to accelerate growth in our base business. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we experienced a significant increase in employee healthcare costs.  Reported EPS was $0.87 in the fourth quarter compared to $3.12 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $1.98 compared to $3.33 last year. Cash from operations was $1.72 billion for full year 2022 versus $2.23 billion in the prior year period.  Turning to our full year 2023 guidance, revenues are expected to be between $8.83 billion and $9.03 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.65 billion and $8.75 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $175 million and $275 million. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.61 to $8.21, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.40 to $9. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.  For our 2023 guidance, please consider the following. As Jim highlighted, we are now assuming COVID-19 molecular volumes to average roughly 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day for the full year. We expect volumes to continue to decline through the spring and summer but could see a modest uptick during respiratory season in Q4. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to continue near recent levels through the end of the PHE.  CMS has indicated that reimbursements will be $51 when the PHE expires in May. We continue to negotiate with health plans regarding coverage policies and reimbursements for COVID-19 testing post-PHE. Note that our COVID-19 testing revenue guidance for 2023 is approximately $150 million lower than the expectations we had back in October. With COVID-19 testing becoming a significantly smaller portion of our overall business, we expect an earnings cadence that is more in line with pre-pandemic seasonality this year, with Q1 typically being the lowest quarter of the year at roughly 22% to 23% of full year earnings.  We have also taken actions to reduce our SG&A by approximately $100 million in 2023, including workforce reductions of approximately 1.5% primarily in corporate support functions. The benefit of these actions will be modest in Q1 and will expand in the second quarter.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Yes, so maybe I'll add a couple of comments, Ann, and thank you for the question - this is Sam.  Versus what we shared back when we talked about in Q3 of 2022 around the fact that we were somewhere in that 850 range, obviously some positives that you mentioned, which is I think what you are referring to as the $115 million to $125 million, which includes the PAMA delay, which includes also the reimbursement of the specimen collection fees, which we now benefit from. But there are a couple of things also that have changed to the negative, really the key one being--or just one thing, really, that's changed to the negative, I should say, which is COVID.  The COVID assumptions that we had back then were, as Jim just said, 10,000 to 15,000 a day. Now we're seeing volumes, as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, 17,000 a day in January, and January is typically around the peak of the respiratory season and then it starts to come down from there, so our expectations of 10,000 to 15,000 a day for the year are, I would say, realistic. But in terms of the range itself and what differentiates the bottom versus the top, I think it's going to be really around the COVID assumptions. But again, keep in mind we've taken COVID down by $150 million in terms of total revenues versus what we really shared back in October, when we expected 10,000 to 15,000. We've also--from the benefit itself, you know, the $115 million to $125 million that you referenced, we've also carved out a small amount for investments in the business, strategic investments that, as we said a couple of months ago, we said we will reserve some of that benefit to invest in the business for long term growth. Sure Patrick, yes, and thank you for the question. Let me talk a little bit about Q4 and the margin rate in Q4, the 14.2%. Here are some of the headwinds, some of which we were seeing throughout the year, but obviously we also had a drop in COVID revenues in Q4 which was significant versus Q3, at least sequentially, which impacted the margin as well.  In terms of the margin rate itself, we had inflation, I would say per expectations but still elevated. We had growth investments of roughly about $40 million that impacted Q4, which were fairly in line with Q3, what we had in terms of investments, so not necessarily a sequential driver. One driver in Q4 that impacted our margin rate was higher employee healthcare cost. That was higher than our expectations and some of it driven by higher utilization, especially towards the end of the year after employees have met their deductibles, but also higher cost of healthcare in general. That was about 80 basis points of impact on the quarter in terms of negative rate impact, so that was another thing. I talked about--obviously if you're looking at things sequentially, you have to factor in that COVID revenues were $184 million roughly versus approximately $313 million in Q3, so a big drop in COVID revenues. Now if you look prospectively in 2023, here are some of the things that obviously give us confidence that we can achieve the rate that we have in our projections and that's factored into the guidance that we gave. We have taken $100 million in SG&A reductions, and I would say 90% of those have already been implemented. Now, you won't see the benefit starting in Q1, you'll probably see it in the latter part of Q1 and really taking effect in Q2 more fully, but that's $100 million in SG&A reductions that we expect to see over the course of this year. In terms of investments, you referenced that, we expect investments to be less dilutive in 2023 versus 2022, because we start to see the benefit from some of these investments towards the growth of our business. Then finally, obviously the margin rate is going to benefit from the specimen collection fee reimbursement that we have, and we have a volume growth assumption as well and a revenue growth assumption that at the midpoint of the guidance range is, on base business, approximately 3%, and so that's going to drive also additional margin improvement based on the drop-down from those revenues. You're welcome. At the risk of being redundant here, I'm still going to repeat something from what Jim said at the beginning, because it's really important for all your assumptions. The productivity improvements and the Invigorate actions, which is the 3% that we expect to get, that's in addition on top of the $100 million of SG&A reductions that we've already taken for the most part. Yes, maybe just to put a couple of points of emphasis around it, in the prepared remarks we talked about a price impact in Q4 of roughly 50 basis points year-over-year of price headwind. As we look towards 2023, what's reflected in our guidance right now is actually a positive price impact year-over-year, and obviously that's benefited from the reimbursement of the specimen collection fee. It's definitely a positive. We've managed to really make some good progress in terms of our pricing. No, Kevin. The billion dollar share authorization increase, that's in addition to the $311 million that we currently have on the previous authorization, but you should not expect that that is what's assumed in the guidance. What we've assumed, actually, is that any share buybacks we do are to offset equity dilution, so essentially the share count is roughly flat with where we are at the end of the year, so don't assume the $1 billion to be built into the projections. Yes, so I'll handle the questions, but I missed the part on the expense. What type of expense? Oh, net interest expense - okay. That's roughly flat, I'd say year-over-year in terms of \u2018222 to '23, Derik, is the assumption to take there.  In terms of M&A, what we have assumed in our guide for 2023 is really no material prospective M&A, so essentially what's closed already, what was included in '23 in terms of deals that have been made - any outreach, for instance, hospital deals that have already closed in '22, those you'll see a benefit from in '23, but there is no prospective M&A included. When you think about our long term target that we had talked about, around 2% contribution from M&A, we have not assumed any prospective M&A in '23 on top of our base revenue growth. It's not significant. We're not going to give the exact contribution, but it's really not that material in terms of what we have this year that carries into next year. Yes, thank you, Rachel, for the question - this is Sam. In terms of the geography, I think it's consistent with what we said before, and let me repeat what we said because we haven't seen really a major change in the dynamic yet. We are back to pre-pandemic levels and above across most geographies, the notable exception being the east, where New York City, I think we've seen roughly 3% to 5% outflow from the city in terms of population, 3% to 5% of the population leaving the city. We haven't seen that fully come back yet, even though the city is much more vibrant and there's more activity. But I don't think in terms of people coming back and getting health care in New York City, I don't think it's back to where it was pre-pandemic by any means. The other thing we look at is ridership on public transportation as an indicator, as a key metric to see how is that also coming back, and it's still about 35% or so below pre-pandemic levels in terms of ridership, based on the last data points that we got. The punch line here being that the east is still lagging, but everywhere else is above pre-pandemic levels in terms of utilization. Thank you everybody."

            "name": "Jim Davis",
            "content": "Thanks Shawn, and good morning everyone. Quest had a strong year in 2022 with base business revenues growing more than 6% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. As we expected COVID-19 testing revenues declined but still exceeded $1.4 billion in 2022. Our strong performance over the last several years would not have been possible without the commitment and compassion of our nearly 50,000 colleagues who rose to the challenge of COVID-19 while growing our base business. I am incredibly proud of how this team has worked together during an unprecedented period in the lab industry to deliver insights to help create a healthier world. This morning, I'll discuss our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our 2023 guidance. In the fourth quarter, total revenues were $2.3 billion, earnings per share were $0.87 on a reported basis and $1.98 on an adjusted basis, cash from operations was $334 million. For the full year 2022, total revenues were $9.9 billion, including more than $8.4 billion in base business revenue. Earnings per share were $7.97 on a reported basis and $9.95 on an adjusted basis. Cash from operations was $1.7 billion. As you saw this morning, we increased our quarterly dividend approximately 8% to $0.71 per share and increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion.  Before discussing additional highlights for 2022, I'd like to share some recent positive regulatory updates. First, Congress delayed Medicare reimbursement cuts under PAMA that were scheduled to take place in 2023, which would have impacted our revenue between approximately $80 million and $85 million. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to work closely with our trade association to seek a permanent fix to PAMA. Second, CMS increased Medicare reimbursement for specimen collection fees for the first time in nearly 40 years. This could provide Quest with a benefit of approximately $35 million to $40 million this year. Regarding COVID-19 testing revenues, while we did see a steady ramp upward in COVID-19 volumes throughout Q4, our volumes have steadily declined since late December. We expect our COVID-19 revenues to be significantly lower in 2023 compared to 2022. We have lowered our prior COVID-19 volume expectations in 2023 from 10,000 to 15,000 molecular tests per day to 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day. In addition, we continue to negotiate coverage and reimbursement policies with commercial payors following the end of the PHE in May. I will now share some recent highlights in how we are growing this business. In the fourth quarter, we completed our acquisition of the outreach laboratory services business of Suma Health, a large integrated health system serving communities in northeastern Ohio. We also entered into an agreement to acquire select assets of Northern Light Health's outreach laboratory services business located in Maine. We will also provide professional laboratory management services for nine of Northern Light's hospital laboratories along with its cancer center lab. Our M&A pipeline is strong, including potential deals with health systems, small regional labs, and other capability-building assets. In particular, the funnel of opportunities with health systems, which are facing major margin pressures due to labor challenges and mix shift from inpatient to outpatient care, is very active. Quest can help through lab management, population health analytics, mobile services, and/or by monetizing their outreach business. In health plans, we continue to gain traction with value-based contracts where we see meaningfully higher growth than with traditional contracts. Also, we've started to benefit from incentives related to these value-based contracts which helps demonstrate the value of these strategic relationships. With CMS' recent increase in Medicare reimbursement for specimen collections, we've begun discussions with our health plan customers about getting paid appropriately for the phlebotomy services we provide to their members. Higher specimen collection fees enable us to make continuous investment in patient services so their members continue to have the broadest access to high quality and low cost lab testing. In advanced diagnostics, we generated strong double-digit growth in prenatal genetics and pharma services in 2022. In 2022, we also launched a solid tumor expanded panel as a laboratory-developed test. This 523 gene test relies upon the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 assay to help oncologists with therapy selection by providing comprehensive genomic profiling of a patient's tumor. This test extends our capabilities beyond tissue pathology to offer faster turnaround time from cancer diagnosis to therapy selection. Throughout 2022, we continued to make investments to strengthen our bio-informatics capabilities which support some of the faster growing opportunities of our portfolio, like genomic sequencing services, prenatal and hereditary genetic testing, and pharma services. We also invested in our women's health sales force which will position us well for continued strong growth in prenatal genetics.  We continue to make progress executing our consumer initiated testing strategy. Last year, we recorded approximately $96 million of both base and COVID-19 consumer testing. In the fall of 2022, we launched our new digital platform, QuestHealth.com. Consumers have found this to be a simpler, more intuitive way to order lab tests. Following the launch of our new consumer sight, we began ramping up marketing spend through the fourth quarter. We saw some of the strongest order volumes to date following some Cyber Monday promotional advertising, and we are encouraged by the acceleration of growth in base testing in December. Shifting to operational excellence, in 2022 we approached our goal of 3% productivity improvements and savings through our Invigorate program. Those savings and productivity improvements did not completely offset the inflationary pressures in our business, as well as the impact of a modest unit price decline. Following the pandemic, we like many companies have faced significant inflation and wage pressures. We are increasing our efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in our base business.  We continue to drive additional productivity improvements with lab platform consolidation and greater use of automation and artificial intelligence. Last year, we began a new automation conversion project in our Lenexa laboratory. This new project builds on what work we've done in our Marlborough and Clifton labs. We've introduced a new microbiology platform that is highly automated and makes use of artificial intelligence to assist with sample analysis. Finally, we've begun to realize savings from the urinalysis platform conversion that we announced early last year.  Filling and retaining our frontline positions continues to be a key priority for us. Although we have experienced higher than average turnover in some of our job categories, we have taken actions to stabilize our workforce and improve frontline employee engagement and retention. We expect these actions to help enhance our productivity in 2023. We have also taken actions to reduce our SG&A by approximately $100 million in 2023, including workforce reductions of approximately 1.5% primarily in corporate support functions. With that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2023 guidance. Sam? Thanks Sam. To summarize, we delivered strong growth of 5% in our base business in 2022. COVID testing revenues as expected declined last year and will represent a significantly smaller portion of our business going forward. We are increasing our efforts to drive productivity and expand margins in our base business. We look forward to sharing more of our strategy during our upcoming investor day on March 16 at the New York Stock Exchange. Look for an announcement soon with more details on this event. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Yes, let me just speak first about the revenue guidance. As we indicated in the remarks, our COVID guidance, which had originally been 10,000 to 15,000 requisitions per day in '23, we've revised that downward to 5,000 to 10,000 per day, and it's really just based on the trends we're seeing. It peaked in December. We averaged roughly 17,000 a day here in January, but that's had a downward slope, so we continue to expect COVID volumes to decline and it's really had about $150 million change in revenue versus what we thought last fall. Again, the guidance we've suggested - you know, a midpoint of about $225 million in COVID revenue for the year. On the base business, without acquisition help, we've assumed a 2.5% to 3% revenue growth on the total base business, so really that's the explanation on the revenue side. Yes, so Jack, let me start. On CIT, our consumer initiated testing business, the total $96 million, more of it was COVID than our base business; however, our base business, once we launched the new platform, once we launched the marketing spend actually performed as expected in November and December. We got significant growth year-over-year, over 50% growth in the month of December based on the initiatives we put in place.  As we've said, this year we expect that business to be less dilutive versus 2022. In terms of the total revenue projection for CIT, you know, we'll give you something at investor day. Obviously COVID will significantly ramp down, but we expect our base to significantly ramp up, and we'll give you a better view of that at investor day. Here's what I'd say. As we indicated, the volume is coming down, right - we said 10 to 15 last fall, we now expect 5 to 10 for the year. The one thing I'll say on serology, we had a significant contract with the CDC, it was simply a test add-on seroprevalence study. That contract, as expected, ended in December. The CDC just doesn't need that information anymore. What does remain, in addition to the PCR volume, is we've got a roughly $25 million contract with the CDC to do continuous sequencing work of the positive cases to help inform the CDC and others about the spread or development of new variants that continue to pop up. You're welcome. Yes AJ, thanks for the question. I would tell you no, there's no real change in the competitive dynamic in terms of pursuit of these hospital outreach deals or professional lab services types of engagements. What I would tell you is the funnel is as big as it's ever been. We expect to close several deals here in the first half of the year, so still feel very good about that.  In terms of small regional labs that are out there, first I'd say there's not that many left out there that are of significant size. Certainly those that participated in COVID testing, and now that that volume is declining, yes, we are seeing a few raise their hands and put up the retirement flag and potentially sell out, so we look at each and every one of them. If we think it adds to our competitive position in a certain geographic marketplace, we'll look at it. If we don't think we need it from a competitive standpoint, then we take a bye on those. You're welcome. Yes, so first, the $100 million cost takeout is incremental to our Invigorate plan for 2023. With our Invigorate plan, we target roughly 3% of our entire cost base for the company, so call that $6.4 billion-ish, 3%, call it $180 million, $190 million a year. We actually got very close to that target in 2022. As we've said in the prepared remarks, it did not completely offset wage inflation and the slight price headwind that we did see, along with just other non-labor inflationary pressures. Now as we go into 2023, we've got a full funnel of productivity ideas, productivity initiatives that we're driving through the company. I would say the other thing that we think will really help us in 2023 is simply the stabilization of our workforce. Attrition has a really major impact on your productivity when you're constantly churning phlebotomists, logistics and specimen processing, so that has stabilized, it's coming down. We feel good about it and we feel good about the overall productivity plan in terms of offsetting inflation, which we expect to be slightly softer, easier in 2023, and we expect price all-in across Quest Diagnostics to actually be a positive for 2023. Yes, so our phlebotomy rates vary by region of the country. What I would tell you is our increase in wages for phlebotomy were certainly in line with the 3% to 4% wage impact that we saw last year. It's what we're planning for 2023, and as I indicated, our retention has improved. Our attrition has certainly stabilized and declined, so we feel good about that. Yes, I'm sorry, the supply inflation. Again, 70% of what we purchase each year is under contract. When those contracts come up, they generally represent an opportunity for deflation, meaning we're going to run a competition between the vendors and we look for improvements from a cost, quality and turnaround time perspective. Where the inflation hit us in 2022 is really on some of the non-supplies, the reagents and things like that. Some of that could have been pre-analytical supplies, masks, gowns, things like that, as well as just the normal inflation that you all see in your businesses, which could be hotels, air travel and things like that. Now again, we think that's softening here as we get into 2023, and we certainly put guardrails on travel and living expenses and things like that. Yes, I think we said in the prepared remarks that our pricing was down about 50 basis points, which actually represents the best that I've seen in my time with Quest Diagnostics, so we feel good about that. We've also said that as we renegotiate new contracts, and every one of these contracts is four to five years in length so you can expect that 20% to 25% will renew this year, which they will, and the preponderance of those contracts we've seen rate increases at a minimum rate--you know, holding rate flat to prior contracts, so we view that as a very positive. What we've also said is, look - we've got a $35 million to $40 million rate increase through Medicare draw fee increases, and today we get reimbursed on roughly 25% of the commercial draws that we do. We're going to push hard not only to expand that 25% but those that do reimburse us to take those rates up as well, so we are pushing hard at every turn to increase prices across this business. The last thing I'd say is, look, there's a portfolio of $700 million to $800 million of other businesses in Quest Diagnostics - that can be our Exam One business, our employer solutions business, our employee population health business, and we've pushed for 2% to 3% price increases on that portfolio of business and we've largely gotten those in place for 2023. Again, this is the most optimistic price outlook that we've put forward since I joined Quest in 2013. The other thing I want to mention is we've talked about these value-based contracts, and over 30% of our health plan contracts have some type of incentive for us to earn additional value, which we actually don't put into the price equation, but it's really good payor mix. These incentives could be based on share of spend with Quest Diagnostics, it could be based on leakage, it could be based on the movement of requisitions from high priced hospital labs into laboratories like Quest Diagnostics, so those value-based incentives are an important part of our business, and as we succeed in achieving that value for the health plans, there's rewards that come back to us. Yes, again the $100 million, it is incremental to our Invigorate plan of record, and yes, it drops right to the bottom line. In terms of pricing, no, the improvement drops to the bottom line as well. We're not suggesting any other offset at this point. Obviously we had strong [indiscernible] both in Q4 and for the year. That benefit, we would put in three buckets: test mix, which was very positive for the year; we saw a big surge of flu and RSV testing along with COVID, but flu and RSV that came in Q4, that has since moderated; and then our business mix was good in terms of payor mix. Then finally, year-over-year we made nice improvements in patient concessions, so our ability to collect, our ability to reduce denials and get paid for the work we do was certainly a positive tailwind for us in 2022. Yes, so again, CMS--and we've had direct discussions with them, it's very clear that once the public health emergency ends, the rate will go to $51. We are certainly expecting and driving those discussions with commercial payors that we expect that rate to be $51 as well. It's a new test that should be treated as such. Some may have a slightly different opinion on that, Andrew, so that's where we negotiate. In addition to that, there's coverage policy decisions that all need to be worked out as well, asymptomatic versus symptomatic testing, so we're bullish that the country needs these tests, commercial payors need these tests, and we're going to drive these discussions in the most favorable way that we can. In terms of respiratory panels, obviously with COVID still out there, it's not going to go away in 2023. When patients presented in the fall, winter and here in January with respiratory symptoms, some physicians ordered three tests, some physicians ordered one and then re-flexed to others, depending on if the first one turned out to be negative, so there were a variety of patterns that were out there. But you know, we don't expect COVID to go away in 2023, so whether RSV and flu tick up like they did in 2022 remains to be seen, and so we'll just have to see how it plays out in the late fall, early winter. Yes, so we've talked about our investments in really three categories. First, consumer initiated testing, which we covered, that business will continue to grow on the base side of our testing in 2023, and as we've indicated, it will certainly be less dilutive than it was in 2022.  The second big area of investments has been in oncology and what we call genomic sequencing services, and really building out what we call our integrated genomics platform. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we brought up a new LDT in Q4 using the Illumina platform - it's referred to as the TSO 500, but it is a Quest LDT, and it's really important in therapy selection decisions for cancer. We're really happy about that. We brought it up at our SJC facility and we'll be expanding that to a second facility here in early 2023, so we certainly expect that business to grow.  On this integrated genomics platform, look - the world has moved from micro array testing to whole exome to whole transcriptome, and now moving quickly to whole genome testing, and we expect with this platform to have a really good sample to complete information platform, low cost, high throughput, really good turnaround time, and we'll update you more about that at our upcoming investor day. The final thing is--you know, we referred to it as pharma services, which grew over 15% last year, and this is us participating in companion diagnostics. We participate in phase 1 clinical trials, either from a pharma company or from a CRO, and then we do a lot of testing and validation work for our IVD partners in the industry, and that business continues to grow as well.  The last thing I'd say is, look, we felt really good about our growth in prenatal testing this year and other rare genetic disorders, so it's a business that continues to grow in the high single, low double digits for Quest Diagnostics. Yes, and then Rachel, thanks for the question on investor day. I think there's really four broad topics that we're going to talk about. First around growth, we'll go deep on what we're doing from an oncology and genomic sequencing standpoint. We'll give you a lot more color on our consumer initiated testing business, the progress we're making and why we continue to be excited about that, and then we'll also address the core part of this business, which is serving physicians, serving health systems, and what we're doing to continue to drive growth in those segments. Finally and as always, we'll address what we're doing to improve the customer experience and drive productivity in this business. It's a never-ending part of what we do and we continue to drive productivity, and we'll give you our plans for '23 and beyond. Finally, just as a reminder, it is March 16, it will be at the New York Stock Exchange, and we'll obviously provide our long term outlook as part of that session. Okay, so I wanted to thank everybody for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing you all on March 16 at the New York Stock Exchange, and have a great afternoon. Thanks everyone."

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.\nShawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; Jim Davis, CEO elect; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and then we will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 future results include but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, healthcare insurer, government and client payer reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular test, the pandemic impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts which are drivers beyond the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. While we had a strong third quarter, we drove 5% growth in the base business despite the impact of Hurricane Ian and we delivered strong earnings despite inflationary pressures and investments in growth areas. Based on our performance, we have raised our outlook for the remainder of 2022. We also made very good progress on our leadership transition, adding management depth and expertise to help us grow in important areas. As you know, Jim will assume the responsibilities of CEO and President on November 1, and I will remain as Executive Chairman. Before I turn it over to Jim, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to say a few words about savings access to Laboratory Services Act Salsa. If enacted Salsa would fix PAMA and put the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule back on a sustainable path. Based on the efforts of our trade Association, support for Salsa has broadened and continues to strengthen. As you know, we are currently planning for a Medicare fee schedule reduction under PAMA of $80 million to $90 million in 2023 if Congress does not intervene again this year. However, the work we are doing is aimed at reducing or postponing that burden and unfortunately, Congress has already acted three times to stop further cuts from going into place. It is therefore very important that we continue to build support for the enactment of Salsa when Congress returns to Washington after the election. As I transition to the Executive Chairman, will remain actively engaged on this issue, working with ACLA and other stakeholders. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to turn it over to Jim Davis.\nJim Davis: Thanks, Steve. On behalf of our 50,000 Quest colleagues, I would like to thank you for your leadership of Quest Diagnostics over the last 10 years. You turned around a company that was struggling and build shareholder value and transformed Quest into a trusted healthcare partner with a strong foundation for future growth. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m personally grateful for all the help and guidance and friendship that you shared during the transition. Thanks, Steve. Turning to our results. Our base business grew year-over-year in the third quarter with performance rebounding in August and September from the softer volume trends that we saw earlier in the year. In fact, before Hurricane Ian hit in September, we were seeing some of the highest base testing volumes we have ever experienced. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to thank our employees for their incredible efforts to restore our labs and PSCs for our patients and customers in the wake of Hurricane Ian while also enduring personal loss of their homes and belongings. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also grateful to our employees outside of the impacted areas, who stepped up to provide financial support to our colleagues in need. As many of you are aware of Florida is an important state for us. During the quarter, we grew the base business revenues and continue to invest in advanced diagnostics and consumer initiated testing. To help offset inflationary pressures we have continued to pursue our operational excellence strategy and have been closely managing our cost structure through our invigorate initiatives. In the third quarter, total revenues were 2.5 billion. Earnings per share were $2.17 on a reported basis and $2.36 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $502 million. COVID-19 testing revenues were 316 million in the third quarter down 55% from 2021 and down 11% from the previous quarter. After plateauing in June and July, our COVID-19 molecular testing volumes steadily declined. We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to average 10,000 to 15,000 per day in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we continued to make progress executing our two point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Here are some highlights from the quarter. M&A continues to be a driver of growth. We recently announced an outreach lab purchase from Summa Health, a large integrated healthcare delivery system in Ohio. While this is a small acquisition, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a positive indicator. We are seeing that hospital systems are more open to discussions and before the pandemic. Many large and small health systems face substantial financial and labor pressures that make our range of services very attractive. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased with the activity in our M&A pipeline and hope to share additional news with you later this year. We also announced a professional lab services relationship with Lee Health, Southwest Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary community owned health system to provide supply chain expertise for five hospitals owned by Lee health and selected outpatient centers. We will also continue to perform reference testing for Lee Health. Our implementation plans have been slightly delayed by Hurricane Ian, though we expect this relationship will have a positive impact on revenue growth in 2023.  Turning now to health plans. Both volumes and revenues continue to grow faster than our overall base business in the quarter. Value based care relationships continue to gain traction. Not only does this yield benefit for health plans in their members, but also it enables us to gain share. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve begun to renew some of our value based contracts with national health plans while continuing to engage and expand our value based footprint with other plans. Value based relationships are appealing to health plans because it helps them reduce the overall cost of care, provides insights to better health outcomes and provides an exceptional value to members. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on track to meet our goal of realizing 50% of our health plan revenues from value based relationships by the end of next year. Also, as we continue to extend and renegotiate health plan agreements, we see increased volumes and pricing from these contracts. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a more favorable pricing environment. And over the last two years the majority of our renewals have included stable to positive reimbursement. In advanced diagnostics we saw growth from prenatal genetics and genomic sequencing services in the third quarter. We continued to make investments to strengthen our capabilities to accelerate growth in oncology and hematology, hereditary genetics, genomic sequencing services and pharma services. Just last week, we announced the addition of Mark Gardner, our Senior Vice President of molecular genomics and oncology. In this new position Mark, an established leader in molecular genomics next generation sequencing and oncology diagnostics, is responsible for driving growth and expanding our offerings in these areas. The investments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making in consumer initiated testing enabled us to recently launch a new e-commerce platform. The new site is more powerful and consumer friendly with a compelling user experience and a number of enhancements. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re encouraged by the early success of the site in the first few weeks of its launch, and we expect to make further progress in the fourth quarter ending in 2023 toward our goal of $250 million of annual consumer initiated testing revenues by 2025. We also launched a new ad campaign to drive broader awareness of our consumer initiated testing offerings which cover everything from women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health tests to allergy testing, and sexually transmitted infections. Check out the new site at Questhealth.com and look for the new ads. The second part of our two points strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and cost, thereby driving productivity gains and improving the customer experience. Here are a few examples. As COVID-19 volumes have declined, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve begun to repurpose some of our COVID-19 testing platforms to enhance our quality and reduce costs. Today, 75% of our patients are arriving at PSC with an appointment compared to less than 25% just three years ago. This increased number of appointments allows us to flex our workforce to meet demand within a particular geography, which enables us to serve our patients faster. For patients who walk into a patient service center our new schedule a check in program sets expectations in the waiting room and balances the load for our phlebotomist. Walk-ins now self register when they arrive and learn how long they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to wait. Our average wait time is approximately five minutes, which is roughly half the level since 2019. Finally, we continue to drive the use of automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity gains to help offset inflationary pressures. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it over to Sam who will provide more details on a performance and share more insights on our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022.\nSam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.5 billion down 10.4% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 5.1% to $2.17 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 55% to $316 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 10.5% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the third quarter of 2021 partially offset by solid growth in our base testing revenue despite the impact of Hurricane Ian at the end of the quarter. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 6.2% versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 20 basis points to the total volume. Total and organic base testing volumes increased 1.6% and 1.4% respectively versus the prior year. The performance of our base business strengthened beginning in late July as COVID-19 cases and the positivity rates declined throughout August and September. The impact of Hurricane Ian represented a headwind of approximately 30 basis points to volume growth in the quarter. COVID-19 testing volumes continued to decline during the third quarter. We resulted approximately 3.1 million molecular tests down approximately 4 million tests and 0.4 million tests versus the prior year and second quarter respectively. Our COVID-19 molecular volumes have averaged roughly 17,000 tests per day so far in October. Revenue for requisition declined 5.1% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec was up 3.3%. The more favorable pricing environment remained consistent with our expectations with unit price reimbursement pressure of less than 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $392 million or 15.8% of revenues compared to $652 million or 23.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $423 million or 17% of revenues compared to $694 million or 25% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline and adjusted operating income is primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volume and investments to accelerate growth in our base business. We were also impacted by a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from non-traditional retail channels, which carry additional expenses. Reported EPS was $2.17 in the quarter compared to $4.02 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.36 compared to $3.96 last year. The impact of Hurricane Ian reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.05 in the third quarter. Year-to-date, cash provided by operations was $1.38 billion in 2022, versus $1.75 billion in the prior year period. Turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.72 billion and $9.86 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.38 billion and $8.45 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $1.34 billion and $1.41 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.52 to $8.72 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9.75 to $9.95. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.7 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. And when you think about our updated guidance, please consider the following. We are assuming COVID-19 molecular volumes to average roughly 10,000 to 15,000 tests per day in the fourth quarter. We also believe this is a reasonable assumption for run rate COVID-19 molecular testing volumes heading into 2023. Last week, the public health emergency was extended another 90 days through mid January. We therefore assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the end of this year. We expect reimbursements to decline when the PHG expires, which we currently assume will happen in January. Given the timing of hurricane Ian the impact on our business has continued in the first couple of weeks of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we are making investments this year to accelerate growth. We spent approximately $110 million through the third quarter and we expect to invest more than $50 million in the fourth quarter primarily to support marketing and promotion of our new consumer initiated testing platform. Finally, before getting to your questions, I wanted to say a few words about 2023. I know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of focus on EPS expectations for 2023. As you might expect, we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prepared to provide detailed 2023 guidance today. There are obviously a number of assumptions and dynamics to consider but I see nothing that would prevent us from meeting current consensus estimates for next year within a reasonable range of outcomes. We will continue to review our plans and assumptions and provide our full 2023 guidance in early February. I will now turn it back to Steve. \nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Sam. Well to summarize, we accelerated growth in the base business year-over-year. We grew our base business revenue while continue to make investments which position us well for the future. And we have raised our full year guidance based on our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022.As Jim mentioned earlier, this will be my last earnings call as CEO and President and I will remain as Executive Chairman. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to thank all of you on this call for your interest in the company. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve enjoyed our many conversations over the last 10 years and I thank you for your time and commitment to understand our business. Finally, to the 50,000 Colleagues of Quest Diagnostics, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your CEO. Together, we have empowered better health with our insights, grown the business and provide a critical testing capacity through one of the most challenging healthcare crisis in our history. I will always be grateful what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done to serve our customers. Thank you. Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? \nOperator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions.  The first question in the queue is from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Ann if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re there, please check your mute button.\nAnn Hynes: Okay. Sorry about that. Okay, Steve, I just want to say congratulate -- and it has been a pleasure working with you all these years.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks Ann.\nAnn Hynes: So my first question thanks for the color on 2023. Obviously, it was on top of investor minds, but just for modeling purposes. Do you just maybe tell us what has changed directionally on the positive side and the negative side since you first provided that in 2019 and maybe within that the DTC program. I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a headwind to earnings this year. Do we expect you to become profitable in 2003? And maybe talk about the profitability profile in 2024? That would be great. Thanks.\nJim Davis: Yes, thanks and good morning. So let me start and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have Sam fill in some color here. So but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of changes since 2019. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just talk about a few tailwinds and headwinds. from a tailwind standpoint reimbursement has never been better. We were down approximately 50 basis points year-to-date. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a much better environment without PAMA in 2019 was where we were historically losing over 100 basis points. And then PAMA was on top of that. So we feel much better about price going into 2023. Our base volumes are back above 2019 levels. In fact, it points during the quarter. In September, we exceeded the high point February, January of 2020. So feel good about that. You mentioned investments in CIT. Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a tailwind going into 2023. We feel good about that. And then as you know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made investments in the business, investing in our advanced diagnostics portfolio, and we expect to get above normal growth rates out of that side of our portfolio. Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dealing with some headwinds, as well as you know. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built into our plan, a third round of PAMA cuts $80 million to $90 million next year COVID, which we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t obviously have in 2019. We expect going into next year there. Early part of next year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be at the 10 to 15 point. And we have some inflation that we certainly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see in 2019 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running through our business. We estimated $0.05 to $0.08 a quarter and we expect that inflation to continue into the early part of next year. Sam, any other caller?\nSam Samad: Yes, I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve captured it. Well, Jim. I mean, again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re, going to give guidance in February, we wanted to just capture some of these maybe changed assumptions, or at least varying assumptions. But listen, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen so far that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen so far, that prevents us from meeting the current consensus estimates again, within a reasonable range of outcomes. In terms of share repurchases, we have made share repurchases this year 950 million throughout the first three quarters of the year, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll provide a lift as well, in terms of earnings next year.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes let me just make another comment about some of the investments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made, because I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit of a misunderstanding about that adding to our cost, and not helping us as we get into \u00e2\u0080\u009823 and \u00e2\u0080\u009824. And Ann you alluded to that. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned that, this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be investing about 160 million. And as you recall, in 2021, we started the investments. We took some of the proceeds from COVID and made roughly a quarter of a billion dollars worth of investments in two businesses. One advanced diagnostics and as Jim said, we probably four we have already started to see have faster growth rates because of those investments. And the second is our consumer initiated testing. And we will only make investments as you would expect if we expect to get a return. And so what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see in 2023, is particularly around CIT are starting to get a return for that investment for CIT. And even though we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report the financials, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see less of a drain on our earnings in 2023 because of the growth rate we will get from CIT and that will be a tailwind for \u00e2\u0080\u009823. And you asked about 2024, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to give exact details, because we will throttle that investment at that a good part of the how fast the market grows, and where we have some capacity to accelerate growth. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hold back on give you an exact number about profitability, but we are going to get to return from that $250 million. And let me just close by saying that $250 million, some of it is permanent, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building these two businesses, advanced diagnostics, and CIT but some of it was temporal. And so when you think about modeling for through 23, and you look at what you might expect for expenses from us for 2022. And these are total expenses R&D and SG&A what we have modeled and working on is actually expenses in \u00e2\u0080\u009823 coming down versus 2022. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a change because some of these investments were temporal. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just leave it there. Thank you.\nAnn Hynes: Thanks. \nOperator: Next question is from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is now open. \nKevin Caliendo: Thanks, actually want to expand on Steve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment right there because thinking through this, thinking through the guidance and getting to the numbers, versus sort of what the run rate is coming out, there has to be a pretty meaningful amount of expenses coming out. So of the 160, should we be thinking about that, as is like, half of that goes away to get to sort of, including PAMA we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking $80 million to $100 million of expenses that would need to come down unless you think volumes are really accelerate and the incremental margins on us. So can you maybe give us a little bit more on the expense side? And how to think about modeling that? Is it just like percentage of that 160 that comes out? \nSam Samad: Yes. So Kevin, as you think about next year, I mean, yes, we are taking expenses down. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be some reductions as we look at expenses given the macro environment that we are in. I would not assume right now, strategic investments necessarily coming down. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an assumption that I would make. And we also have our invigorate program where we expect up productivity in the business and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ongoing program that we do, that we have every year. But we are in a way reinvigorating and invigorate to have further productivity from the business. So I think as you look at margins, you have to consider those things. We have maybe a consistent inflationary environment is the assumption wages increasing by salaries, wages and benefits increasing by 3% to 4%. But we are taking expenses down next year and other areas. And we are focusing on invigorator.\nKevin Caliendo: Maybe I can ask it a little bit different way. Your base margins. I know you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about base margins versus COVID margins. But we all try to model it that way. If we were to think about it, would you then think that base margins could look or be better than what they were in a pre-COVID setting?\nSteve Rusckowski: So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s we should talk about kind of the assumptions that we have right now for 2022. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to comment right now on base margins versus total COVID margins. But I think the way to think about it is the pricing environment is improving. So we are seeing a less of an impact in terms of price reductions. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the PAMA impact for next year. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing historically low pricing pressure on our business, which as we said in the quarter was 60 basis points. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an improvement. I talked about some of the cost reductions that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to make. And I talked about the invigorate productivity savings that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to make. So we are going to definitely see some productivity improvements in the business but I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give a specific base margin number there.\nKevin Caliendo: I tried. Thanks so much, guys. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really helpful. \nOperator: Next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is now open. \nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about utilization. So there was a lot of worry heading into the quarter because of -- your base growth actually accelerated to 5%. So I am just curious what you think is going on here driving the relative out-performance versus what it looks like the market might be doing?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So thank Jack. As we mentioned in the opening comments, our volumes improved every month through the third quarter. So July was weak, August was better. And September, even with the hurricane impact was obviously much better than the average that we reported. In addition we reported 5.1% revenue growth in the quarter on the bass business. And a chunk of that did come from revenue per rack. Despite a 50 basis point headwind on price, our clinical mix and business mix improved in the quarter, which contributed to that strong base performance. And so we were happy with the utilization levels. Physician offices appeared to be strong and even our health system segment, which is a combination of our reference testing in PLS was also strong in the quarter.\nJack Meehan: Maybe just trying to dig in a little bit more. I think everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to understand the market growth and share dynamics, are you, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your dialogue, like with hospitals now around either outreach sales or more kind of reference work getting sent out? Or have you heard more about labor being an issue? Just any thoughts on that would be great.\nSteve Rusckowski: Sure, Jack. So I can tell you that our opportunities with health systems has never been stronger on multiple fronts. Now in the quarter, we announced the Summa health outreach acquisition. Summa as the health system in Akron, Ohio. We announced a PLS new PLS relationship with Lee Health in Florida. And the funnel of opportunities continues to grow. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a day that goes by that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read in one of the journals about health systems reporting, margin pressures and exacerbated by some of the pressures they have with wages, particularly on the nursing side. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very opportunistic us to go into health systems and explain to them how we can help them reduce their lifespan by upwards of 10% to 15% to 18%. And so, or monetize their outreach book of business to provide some cash infusion to them. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opportunistic time for us.\nOperator: Next question is from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nErin Wright: Hi, could you give us an update on your relationships in negotiations with the commercial payers and offsets in terms of pricing dynamics there? And where are we at in terms of those preferred relationships helping to steer volume? And do initiatives such as United laboratory benefit management that was more recent, does that have any impact on your business at all? I believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s targeting some over testing on the esoteric side. Thanks. \nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So thank you, Aaron. So our relationships with commercial payers, if you want to measure the output of the relationship, again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn to the pricing environment. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been better. We are only down 50 basis points in the quarter and you go back to 2018, 2019, we were losing 100 basis points. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also said that the majority of the negotiations we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had with payers over the last two years have resulted in either flat to positive price increases and so we consider that a victory. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also said that the number of value based relationships that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering into meaning that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opportunities for us to create value for them and earn value back for us by working very closely with the likes of United Healthcare and we work together as teams and we target physicians that are using out of network labs. We target physicians that are using health, expensive health system labs, and collectively our teams work this day in and day out and yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to move Rex from high price institutions to better quality lower price labs like Quest Diagnostics.\nJim Davis: Yes to comments on Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question and Erin first of all, or plan is to gain share. And so one element of gain share is that relationships without plans and we do believe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making progress to that progress will continue as we pick up more she are particularly with the Nationals. Just want to make sure we remind you that 50 basis points is not exclusive to commercial payer pricing, but all pricing. So commercial payer pricings within it and that is improved to Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment vastly versus where we were. But we have price pressure with client relationships, with physicians we have price concessions with hospital reference work. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other price concessions in that number. But on the commercial payer side, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less than 50 basis points that much improved of where it was years ago.\nOperator: Next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open. \nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. So as I think about just the core testing, obviously COVID is declining here. How should you be thinking about your outlook here for 2023 especially given the economic backdrop that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing and the broader inflation trends that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing? And how that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impacting the consumer, essentially, the patient?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So thanks, Brian, for the question. The way I would think about it is again, COVID, continues to come down. Although we may be at an inflection point here on COVID. Too early to tell, but obviously, these two new variants, the BQ1 and BQ 1.1 are growing in terms of concern, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now 11%, 12%, of all new cases, higher in the east, reported to be over 20% in the New York City area. But as of now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking 10,000 to 15,000 a day, as we go into next year. We reported that our base business, the volumes recovered, as we move through the third quarter, we expect that trend to continue. And but remember, physicians are only part of it. Again, we feel great about opportunities to help our health system partners whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s additional reference testing, or PLS and then we feel great about our acquisition funnel and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at several outreach opportunities. We announced one that closed but stay tuned. There should be some more announcements as we get into the early part of next year.\nJim Davis: Just to remind you all that there is a correlation between COVID volumes that are based business. And so as COVID improves, we believe that could help our base business. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve clearly started to see that in Q3 and to some extent, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked before, we have somewhat of a natural hedge, because of COVID goes up and base softens. We have seen that in the past. And therefore the improving COVID situation should be a tailwind on base growth going forward. And as we said before, most of our major markets have recovered, we still have not seen full recovery in New York City. And we still believe that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll gradually step by step improve over the next couple of years. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go back to where we were in 2019. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only major metropolitan area that we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen full recovery. So from an overall perspective, the COVID direction should be favorable to base.\nOperator: Next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. \nA.J. Rice: Looking to working together. Maybe just to talk a little bit about capital deployment. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about obviously, you did a lot on the share repurchase here today, as you mentioned. So that continues to be part of the store. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got these hospital opportunities. There are other M&A potentially talking deals out there. And then some of the investments consumer direct and so forth. Does that, how do you see capital priorities and capital deployment as we exited this year and think about the next year or two?\nSam Samad: Yes, thanks, A.J. for the question. This is Sam. So as you think about our position, right now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve generated 1.38 billion of operating cash flow through three quarters of the year. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sitting on a very healthy amount of cash of 700 million. When you think about our capital deployment philosophy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very consistent. We said that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to return the majority of our free cash flow back to shareholders. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to focus on making sure that obviously, we invest in the business that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, we talked about the strategic investments. This year, we expect to make 160 million of strategic we have net of the 400 million of capital, whatever free cash flow that we have, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to return back to shareholders in the form of dividends, in the form of share repurchases and M&A. Now, to the extent that I think we have a robust pipeline of M&A transactions and opportunities, as Jim mentioned, to the extent that we, we are going to be very disciplined about M&A though, I mean, to the extent that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a creative deals that we believe really add strategic value to us and produce the meet the ROIC threshold that we have in our accretive then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to return back that cash in terms of share repurchases.\nOperator: Next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. \nPito Chickering: Hey, good morning, guys. And Steve, thanks for all your help, over the years different questions for the fourth quarter guidance of $1.91 analyzes to 764. And as the good guys, the improved base pricing business as well as strong COVID pricing. So if we put of PAMA in that one, that would be the launch pad in 2023. Is 713, which seems like a pretty big gap versus 850 consensus numbers. So can you give us some more color on how to bridge the gap between 713 and 850 between revenue growth and cost cutting? \nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. Thanks, Pete. Let me start and then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have Sam, pipe in here. So first our long term guidance on the growth rate of the company remains. We expect to grow our top line on the base business 4% to 5%. And we expect to get nice margin accretion off of that 4% to 5%. So we still feel good about that 4% to 5%. Next year, obviously, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said to percentage, roughly two percentage points of that can come from acquisition. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a great list, a good funnel of both tuck ins from outreach, as well as a few what I would call deals that enhance our capabilities, fill in some gaps in our portfolio. So feel good about that. We also feel good about our invigorate program and continuing to work that, as Sam said, reinvigorating our invigorate program to offset some of the margin pressures that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen from inflation. So we feel good about. We feel good about the investments that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making in ADX and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said that, consumer initiated testing next year should be a tailwind to us. And then finally as Sam and Steve said, we are fine tuning the cost structure, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make the necessary rebalances in the cost structure to deliver what we need to deliver next year. So we feel good about that.\nJim Davis: Yes maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add a couple of comments to Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. So just we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to give you obviously guidance right now, but just maybe directionally give you some things also to build into, or to think about as you build your model for next year. Expense reductions is an important one, Jim mentioned that. The fact that CIT investments will drive growth in that consumer segment. And so they will be less dilutive, as you look at next year versus this year. The fact that when you think about pricing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a definitely improving environment for us as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said, 50 basis points in Q3. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an additional number that maybe some of you use the 1% pricing negative pricing impact is no longer the case in terms of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing, because of all the things that we talked about around value based contracts with the health plans. And then when you think about COVID I mean, COVID is obviously the assumption going into 2023 is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10,000 to 15,000. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s variability around that. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our assumption right now. And the 10,000 to 15,000 is so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming down. COVID testing is coming down, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an improvement in the base business as a result of that. But also the fact that with the PHE ending, at least our assumption is that it ends in January, even though that average reimburse price comes down, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a straight impact the margin because we have cost that we incur in the non traditional retail channels right now that will no longer, that we will no longer incur after the end of the PHE emergency. So you can also take you know, the margin on COVID as being completely impacted by that price reimbursed or by that reimbursement decrease.\nSteve Rusckowski: Pito remember that our base business is growing in \u00e2\u0080\u009823. Guys when you say think about modeling it off the fourth quarter remember the base will grow. Okay. And then secondly, just to underscore Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments is this company and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue under Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership has a long track record of productivity improvements. And so Jim, in his prepared remarks talked about our operational excellence program. We have a specific program called Invigorate. And that Invigorate program is to drive 3% productivity. So when you think about 2023, and you think about potentially getting a PAMA cut you need to think about the expense reduction, base growth, as well as Invigorate offsetting some of the inflationary pressure, as well as potentially. And I can tell you we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve highlighted this before, in our investor presentations, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more room for us to drive productivity, particularly around automation, and digitalization going forward, and Jim will be driving that as he leaves the company.\nOperator: Next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is now open. \nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys, thank you for taking the questions. Maybe one, on a similar vein, at least on the cost side, just in terms of some of the labor retention, labor inflation that you guys have seen us talk about against where we are in that process? And then secondarily, kind of on the back of that the supply chain as well, I know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a bit of a kind of issues pop up and you guys handle them well. Has that plateaued getting better? Maybe just a little bit of color, that would be helpful.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, so thanks, Patrick. So first, on the labor inflation. So what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing this year is between 3% and 4%, and our plan next year is to have a merit increase of roughly 3%, across the company. But we would expect to have to make some other equity adjustments along the way. So I think from a planning modeling standpoint, that 3% to 4% range still feels good from a labor utilization. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you on our employee retention and attrition is that it has stabilized here in the third quarter, albeit, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stabilized at a higher level than we would like, which obviously affects productivity. So we continue to work really hard on making classes the employer of choice, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about wages, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of other things, as you can imagine that go into that. In terms of inflation on the supplies and materials front we purchase north of $2 billion worth of what we call pre analytical and analytical supplies. And on that roughly $2 billion, about 80% of it is locked up in terms of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s under contract. And most of those contracts that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve entered into in previous years, actually do not contain price indexes or price going up. If anything through the contract period, sometimes prices improve. So, we feel good about that, but 20% of roughly 2 billion is a big number that is not completely locked up. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we do see some inflationary pressures. In addition to the pre-analytical and analytical supplies we have a lot of, we have roughly $88 million, $900 million of other spend, that is logistics, professional services, janitorial services. Travel living expenses. So, all of that is really not under contract. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we see the majority of inflation in our business today. We will it get better next year, will it get worse next year. Hard to predict. But everything that the Fed is doing, will hopefully slow those inflationary pressures that we are seeing. But again we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed, and we work real hard for our Invigorate program to offset as much of this as we possibly can.\nOperator: Next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning, Steve. Thanks for all your time and patience with me, appreciate it over the years. I guess a couple of questions. A lot of might have been answered already. But are you expecting any sort of relief from you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect to solve for the past and sort of like your update in PAMA and then the follow up on that, or another one you know, as we sort of head into a recession and inflation picks up, I mean, are you seeing any increase in debt from your customers. Any concerns on people opting not to pay bills as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sort of struggling right now. Thanks.\nSteve Rusckowski: So let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with the Salsa PAMA comment. So as we said, for many years now, you should plan on PAMA caught in 2023. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we assumed. And until we have news that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than that, we should assume that. Number two is, in my prepared remarks to talk about the effort on Salsa. What I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add to those comment is the support congressional support. And this is on both sides of the aisle. And both in the House and in the Senate is very strong. So there is alignment that we need to have a permanent fix to the implementation of PAMA. But as you can imagine Washington is busy. There is a lot of topics on the table. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to find a vehicle that we can attach it to. And I would expect, if we were successful with Salsa, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be late in this year, that will know that. And also, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to cost money. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the process of getting a score from CBO. And there needs to be a pay for so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working through that. But I can tell you the alignment and the support of my colleagues throughout this industry has never been stronger. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve going doing grassroots efforts to send letters into Washington. So really a full court press to get set Salsa over the goal line. Now, if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, or if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not successful with Salsa the question is, can we get another year of relief. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got that in the past. Again, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to indicate that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get that again. But if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get Salsa there, obviously will be a pivot to ask for another year of relief. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll push on that. But again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not planning that during our 2023 planning. \nJim Davis: Yes. This is very good question on are we seeing an uptick in patient concession rate or patients unless -- no we are not seeing any impact as of yet on that. In fact, our patient concessions have actually improved rate and has actually improved year-over-year and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to build into next year. We do a lot of things to work this and we work real hard. We have what we call real time adjudication. So, patient comes into our PSE, we take the requisition and we can literally adjudicate that claim x-the payment coming to us. So we know real time what tests on that requisition are going to be approved or denied, and we know what the patient balance is. And then we provide multiple ways for that patient to pay the bill or give us a form of payment so that when the claim is adjudicated, we know how to charge the patient. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on things to actually move that whole process upstream. So when the patient makes an appointment, and that requisition is already been delivered to us, because physician has sent it to us electronically, we can do that pre-adjudication, if you will, as the patient is making an appointment online. So even before they come into the PSC we can pre-adjudicate that claim. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to build the capability to do that. And so it improves our PSE productivity as well as gives the patient knowledge of what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be billed before they walk into the PSE. So lots of things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing to make it easier to pay to inform the patient. And all of those things help our patient concession rate.\nOperator: And the last question in the queue is from . Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks very much. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to come back to a topic that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been hit a few times but maybe ask a different way. The base revenue per requisition very, very strong here. I know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard a lot of comments on pricing improving or really being less bad down 50 bibs, which would I think imply that your mix component and other components must have been something more like 4% growth on a per test basis. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious if you can quantify for us or give us some qualitative color on what type of mix improvements you saw? What categories of testing, were you seeing the number of tests per requisition go up this quarter more than normal? Was there a changing impact from PLS volumes and the numbers this quarter? Or were there some nuances with value based contracts that maybe aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully understood by the street that could have been driving some of this upside mixed driven revenue? I know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m throwing a lot at you, but it feels like that was a pretty big number. So want to dig into it.\nJim Davis: Yes. So. Thanks Eric. So as you know, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of things that go into the calculation. So let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take price per test out, because we already said that was down about 50 basis points. So your math is directionally correct. All of the things that were up about 3.8% in the quarter. there is really three very different types of mix that enter into that. There is clinical mix, business mix and payer mix. And from let me just start with clinical mix. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just tell you that the investments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making in advanced diagnostics are paying off. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting a higher mix of molecular and other genetic and advanced based tasks. Hematology was good. Caner testing really good in the quarter. From a business mix standpoint there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of things there. First, from a commercial payer standpoint, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mix of cap and fee for service, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just tell you in the quarter fee per service was better and cap was lost. And if cap was less than, obviously, you got to fix payments. So that certainly helped us. Our health systems business was actually just a pure reference was good in the quarter and that tends to mix up our rep per and then finally there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s payer mix issues. What portion is coming from commercial? What portion is coming from Medicare? What portion is coming from Medicaid? And that was favorable in the quarter. And then finally, CIT, our consumer initiated testing business has a higher revenue per rack. The pricing is better in that market, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting some left from our CIT business. So a lot of factors go into it. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of the summary of it.\nSteve Rusckowski: Okay, I think that was the last question. I again, thank you for your support over the years, we added up the math and this is my 42nd call. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a pleasure working with all of you. Thank you for all your support. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be seeing me around in our travels. So thank you and have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Third Quarter 2022 conference call.

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.5 billion down 10.4% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 5.1% to $2.17 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 55% to $316 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 10.5% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the third quarter of 2021 partially offset by solid growth in our base testing revenue despite the impact of Hurricane Ian at the end of the quarter. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 6.2% versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 20 basis points to the total volume. Total and organic base testing volumes increased 1.6% and 1.4% respectively versus the prior year. The performance of our base business strengthened beginning in late July as COVID-19 cases and the positivity rates declined throughout August and September. The impact of Hurricane Ian represented a headwind of approximately 30 basis points to volume growth in the quarter. COVID-19 testing volumes continued to decline during the third quarter. We resulted approximately 3.1 million molecular tests down approximately 4 million tests and 0.4 million tests versus the prior year and second quarter respectively. Our COVID-19 molecular volumes have averaged roughly 17,000 tests per day so far in October. Revenue for requisition declined 5.1% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec was up 3.3%. The more favorable pricing environment remained consistent with our expectations with unit price reimbursement pressure of less than 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $392 million or 15.8% of revenues compared to $652 million or 23.5% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $423 million or 17% of revenues compared to $694 million or 25% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline and adjusted operating income is primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volume and investments to accelerate growth in our base business. We were also impacted by a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from non-traditional retail channels, which carry additional expenses. Reported EPS was $2.17 in the quarter compared to $4.02 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.36 compared to $3.96 last year. The impact of Hurricane Ian reduced adjusted EPS by approximately $0.05 in the third quarter. Year-to-date, cash provided by operations was $1.38 billion in 2022, versus $1.75 billion in the prior year period. Turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.72 billion and $9.86 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.38 billion and $8.45 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $1.34 billion and $1.41 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.52 to $8.72 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9.75 to $9.95. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.7 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. And when you think about our updated guidance, please consider the following. We are assuming COVID-19 molecular volumes to average roughly 10,000 to 15,000 tests per day in the fourth quarter. We also believe this is a reasonable assumption for run rate COVID-19 molecular testing volumes heading into 2023. Last week, the public health emergency was extended another 90 days through mid January. We therefore assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through the end of this year. We expect reimbursements to decline when the PHG expires, which we currently assume will happen in January. Given the timing of hurricane Ian the impact on our business has continued in the first couple of weeks of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we are making investments this year to accelerate growth. We spent approximately $110 million through the third quarter and we expect to invest more than $50 million in the fourth quarter primarily to support marketing and promotion of our new consumer initiated testing platform. Finally, before getting to your questions, I wanted to say a few words about 2023. I know therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a lot of focus on EPS expectations for 2023. As you might expect, we arena\u0302\u0080\u0099t prepared to provide detailed 2023 guidance today. There are obviously a number of assumptions and dynamics to consider but I see nothing that would prevent us from meeting current consensus estimates for next year within a reasonable range of outcomes. We will continue to review our plans and assumptions and provide our full 2023 guidance in early February. I will now turn it back to Steve. Yes, I think youa\u0302\u0080\u0099ve captured it. Well, Jim. I mean, again, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re, going to give guidance in February, we wanted to just capture some of these maybe changed assumptions, or at least varying assumptions. But listen, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s nothing that Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ve seen so far that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve seen so far, that prevents us from meeting the current consensus estimates again, within a reasonable range of outcomes. In terms of share repurchases, we have made share repurchases this year 950 million throughout the first three quarters of the year, and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099ll provide a lift as well, in terms of earnings next year. Yes. So Kevin, as you think about next year, I mean, yes, we are taking expenses down. So therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to be some reductions as we look at expenses given the macro environment that we are in. I would not assume right now, strategic investments necessarily coming down. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s not an assumption that I would make. And we also have our invigorate program where we expect up productivity in the business and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s an ongoing program that we do, that we have every year. But we are in a way reinvigorating and invigorate to have further productivity from the business. So I think as you look at margins, you have to consider those things. We have maybe a consistent inflationary environment is the assumption wages increasing by salaries, wages and benefits increasing by 3% to 4%. But we are taking expenses down next year and other areas. And we are focusing on invigorator. Yes, thanks, A.J. for the question. This is Sam. So as you think about our position, right now wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve generated 1.38 billion of operating cash flow through three quarters of the year. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re sitting on a very healthy amount of cash of 700 million. When you think about our capital deployment philosophy, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s very consistent. We said that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to return the majority of our free cash flow back to shareholders. And wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to focus on making sure that obviously, we invest in the business thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s, we talked about the strategic investments. This year, we expect to make 160 million of strategic we have net of the 400 million of capital, whatever free cash flow that we have, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to return back to shareholders in the form of dividends, in the form of share repurchases and M&A. Now, to the extent that I think we have a robust pipeline of M&A transactions and opportunities, as Jim mentioned, to the extent that we, we are going to be very disciplined about M&A though, I mean, to the extent that we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t have a creative deals that we believe really add strategic value to us and produce the meet the ROIC threshold that we have in our accretive then wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to return back that cash in terms of share repurchases."

            "name": "Steve Rusckowski",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. While we had a strong third quarter, we drove 5% growth in the base business despite the impact of Hurricane Ian and we delivered strong earnings despite inflationary pressures and investments in growth areas. Based on our performance, we have raised our outlook for the remainder of 2022. We also made very good progress on our leadership transition, adding management depth and expertise to help us grow in important areas. As you know, Jim will assume the responsibilities of CEO and President on November 1, and I will remain as Executive Chairman. Before I turn it over to Jim, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d like to say a few words about savings access to Laboratory Services Act Salsa. If enacted Salsa would fix PAMA and put the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule back on a sustainable path. Based on the efforts of our trade Association, support for Salsa has broadened and continues to strengthen. As you know, we are currently planning for a Medicare fee schedule reduction under PAMA of $80 million to $90 million in 2023 if Congress does not intervene again this year. However, the work we are doing is aimed at reducing or postponing that burden and unfortunately, Congress has already acted three times to stop further cuts from going into place. It is therefore very important that we continue to build support for the enactment of Salsa when Congress returns to Washington after the election. As I transition to the Executive Chairman, will remain actively engaged on this issue, working with ACLA and other stakeholders. Now Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d like to turn it over to Jim Davis. Thanks, Sam. Well to summarize, we accelerated growth in the base business year-over-year. We grew our base business revenue while continue to make investments which position us well for the future. And we have raised our full year guidance based on our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022.As Jim mentioned earlier, this will be my last earnings call as CEO and President and I will remain as Executive Chairman. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d like to thank all of you on this call for your interest in the company. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ve enjoyed our many conversations over the last 10 years and I thank you for your time and commitment to understand our business. Finally, to the 50,000 Colleagues of Quest Diagnostics, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your CEO. Together, we have empowered better health with our insights, grown the business and provide a critical testing capacity through one of the most challenging healthcare crisis in our history. I will always be grateful what youa\u0302\u0080\u0099ve done to serve our customers. Thank you. Now wea\u0302\u0080\u0099d be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Thanks Ann. Yes let me just make another comment about some of the investments wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve made, because I think therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a little bit of a misunderstanding about that adding to our cost, and not helping us as we get into a\u0302\u0080\u009823 and a\u0302\u0080\u009824. And Ann you alluded to that. So wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve mentioned that, this year, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll be investing about 160 million. And as you recall, in 2021, we started the investments. We took some of the proceeds from COVID and made roughly a quarter of a billion dollars worth of investments in two businesses. One advanced diagnostics and as Jim said, we probably four we have already started to see have faster growth rates because of those investments. And the second is our consumer initiated testing. And we will only make investments as you would expect if we expect to get a return. And so what youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to see in 2023, is particularly around CIT are starting to get a return for that investment for CIT. And even though we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t report the financials, youa\u0302\u0080\u0099ll see less of a drain on our earnings in 2023 because of the growth rate we will get from CIT and that will be a tailwind for a\u0302\u0080\u009823. And you asked about 2024, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not going to give exact details, because we will throttle that investment at that a good part of the how fast the market grows, and where we have some capacity to accelerate growth. And so wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll hold back on give you an exact number about profitability, but we are going to get to return from that $250 million. And let me just close by saying that $250 million, some of it is permanent, because wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re building these two businesses, advanced diagnostics, and CIT but some of it was temporal. And so when you think about modeling for through 23, and you look at what you might expect for expenses from us for 2022. And these are total expenses R&D and SG&A what we have modeled and working on is actually expenses in a\u0302\u0080\u009823 coming down versus 2022. So thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s a change because some of these investments were temporal. So Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll just leave it there. Thank you. So thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s we should talk about kind of the assumptions that we have right now for 2022. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not going to comment right now on base margins versus total COVID margins. But I think the way to think about it is the pricing environment is improving. So we are seeing a less of an impact in terms of price reductions. Therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s the PAMA impact for next year. But wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing historically low pricing pressure on our business, which as we said in the quarter was 60 basis points. So thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s an improvement. I talked about some of the cost reductions that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to make. And I talked about the invigorate productivity savings that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to make. So we are going to definitely see some productivity improvements in the business but I wona\u0302\u0080\u0099t give a specific base margin number there. Yes. So thank Jack. As we mentioned in the opening comments, our volumes improved every month through the third quarter. So July was weak, August was better. And September, even with the hurricane impact was obviously much better than the average that we reported. In addition we reported 5.1% revenue growth in the quarter on the bass business. And a chunk of that did come from revenue per rack. Despite a 50 basis point headwind on price, our clinical mix and business mix improved in the quarter, which contributed to that strong base performance. And so we were happy with the utilization levels. Physician offices appeared to be strong and even our health system segment, which is a combination of our reference testing in PLS was also strong in the quarter. Sure, Jack. So I can tell you that our opportunities with health systems has never been stronger on multiple fronts. Now in the quarter, we announced the Summa health outreach acquisition. Summa as the health system in Akron, Ohio. We announced a PLS new PLS relationship with Lee Health in Florida. And the funnel of opportunities continues to grow. Therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s not a day that goes by that we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t read in one of the journals about health systems reporting, margin pressures and exacerbated by some of the pressures they have with wages, particularly on the nursing side. So ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a very opportunistic us to go into health systems and explain to them how we can help them reduce their lifespan by upwards of 10% to 15% to 18%. And so, or monetize their outreach book of business to provide some cash infusion to them. So ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s an opportunistic time for us. Yes. So thank you, Aaron. So our relationships with commercial payers, if you want to measure the output of the relationship, again, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll turn to the pricing environment. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s never been better. We are only down 50 basis points in the quarter and you go back to 2018, 2019, we were losing 100 basis points. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve also said that the majority of the negotiations wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve had with payers over the last two years have resulted in either flat to positive price increases and so we consider that a victory. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve also said that the number of value based relationships that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re entering into meaning that therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s opportunities for us to create value for them and earn value back for us by working very closely with the likes of United Healthcare and we work together as teams and we target physicians that are using out of network labs. We target physicians that are using health, expensive health system labs, and collectively our teams work this day in and day out and yes, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been able to move Rex from high price institutions to better quality lower price labs like Quest Diagnostics. Yes. So thanks, Brian, for the question. The way I would think about it is again, COVID, continues to come down. Although we may be at an inflection point here on COVID. Too early to tell, but obviously, these two new variants, the BQ1 and BQ 1.1 are growing in terms of concern, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s now 11%, 12%, of all new cases, higher in the east, reported to be over 20% in the New York City area. But as of now, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re thinking 10,000 to 15,000 a day, as we go into next year. We reported that our base business, the volumes recovered, as we move through the third quarter, we expect that trend to continue. And but remember, physicians are only part of it. Again, we feel great about opportunities to help our health system partners whether ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s additional reference testing, or PLS and then we feel great about our acquisition funnel and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re looking at several outreach opportunities. We announced one that closed but stay tuned. There should be some more announcements as we get into the early part of next year. Yes. Thanks, Pete. Let me start and then Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll have Sam, pipe in here. So first our long term guidance on the growth rate of the company remains. We expect to grow our top line on the base business 4% to 5%. And we expect to get nice margin accretion off of that 4% to 5%. So we still feel good about that 4% to 5%. Next year, obviously, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve said to percentage, roughly two percentage points of that can come from acquisition. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve said wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got a great list, a good funnel of both tuck ins from outreach, as well as a few what I would call deals that enhance our capabilities, fill in some gaps in our portfolio. So feel good about that. We also feel good about our invigorate program and continuing to work that, as Sam said, reinvigorating our invigorate program to offset some of the margin pressures that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve seen from inflation. So we feel good about. We feel good about the investments that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re making in ADX and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve said that, consumer initiated testing next year should be a tailwind to us. And then finally as Sam and Steve said, we are fine tuning the cost structure, and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll make the necessary rebalances in the cost structure to deliver what we need to deliver next year. So we feel good about that. Pito remember that our base business is growing in a\u0302\u0080\u009823. Guys when you say think about modeling it off the fourth quarter remember the base will grow. Okay. And then secondly, just to underscore Jima\u0302\u0080\u0099s comments is this company and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll continue under Jima\u0302\u0080\u0099s and Sama\u0302\u0080\u0099s leadership has a long track record of productivity improvements. And so Jim, in his prepared remarks talked about our operational excellence program. We have a specific program called Invigorate. And that Invigorate program is to drive 3% productivity. So when you think about 2023, and you think about potentially getting a PAMA cut you need to think about the expense reduction, base growth, as well as Invigorate offsetting some of the inflationary pressure, as well as potentially. And I can tell you wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve highlighted this before, in our investor presentations, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a lot more room for us to drive productivity, particularly around automation, and digitalization going forward, and Jim will be driving that as he leaves the company. Yes, so thanks, Patrick. So first, on the labor inflation. So what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing this year is between 3% and 4%, and our plan next year is to have a merit increase of roughly 3%, across the company. But we would expect to have to make some other equity adjustments along the way. So I think from a planning modeling standpoint, that 3% to 4% range still feels good from a labor utilization. But Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll tell you on our employee retention and attrition is that it has stabilized here in the third quarter, albeit, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s stabilized at a higher level than we would like, which obviously affects productivity. So we continue to work really hard on making classes the employer of choice, and ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s not just about wages, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a lot of other things, as you can imagine that go into that. In terms of inflation on the supplies and materials front we purchase north of $2 billion worth of what we call pre analytical and analytical supplies. And on that roughly $2 billion, about 80% of it is locked up in terms of ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s under contract. And most of those contracts that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve entered into in previous years, actually do not contain price indexes or price going up. If anything through the contract period, sometimes prices improve. So, we feel good about that, but 20% of roughly 2 billion is a big number that is not completely locked up. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s where we do see some inflationary pressures. In addition to the pre-analytical and analytical supplies we have a lot of, we have roughly $88 million, $900 million of other spend, that is logistics, professional services, janitorial services. Travel living expenses. So, all of that is really not under contract. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s where we see the majority of inflation in our business today. We will it get better next year, will it get worse next year. Hard to predict. But everything that the Fed is doing, will hopefully slow those inflationary pressures that we are seeing. But again wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re committed, and we work real hard for our Invigorate program to offset as much of this as we possibly can. So leta\u0302\u0080\u0099s start with the Salsa PAMA comment. So as we said, for many years now, you should plan on PAMA caught in 2023. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s what we assumed. And until we have news thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s better than that, we should assume that. Number two is, in my prepared remarks to talk about the effort on Salsa. What Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll add to those comment is the support congressional support. And this is on both sides of the aisle. And both in the House and in the Senate is very strong. So there is alignment that we need to have a permanent fix to the implementation of PAMA. But as you can imagine Washington is busy. There is a lot of topics on the table. And wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re trying to find a vehicle that we can attach it to. And I would expect, if we were successful with Salsa, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099ll be late in this year, that will know that. And also, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to cost money. So wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re in the process of getting a score from CBO. And there needs to be a pay for so wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re working through that. But I can tell you the alignment and the support of my colleagues throughout this industry has never been stronger. And wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve going doing grassroots efforts to send letters into Washington. So really a full court press to get set Salsa over the goal line. Now, if we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t, or if wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not successful with Salsa the question is, can we get another year of relief. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got that in the past. Again, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m not going to indicate that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to get that again. But if we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t get Salsa there, obviously will be a pivot to ask for another year of relief. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll push on that. But again, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not planning that during our 2023 planning. Okay, I think that was the last question. I again, thank you for your support over the years, we added up the math and this is my 42nd call. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s been a pleasure working with all of you. Thank you for all your support. And Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m sure youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to be seeing me around in our travels. So thank you and have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. On behalf of our 50,000 Quest colleagues, I would like to thank you for your leadership of Quest Diagnostics over the last 10 years. You turned around a company that was struggling and build shareholder value and transformed Quest into a trusted healthcare partner with a strong foundation for future growth. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m personally grateful for all the help and guidance and friendship that you shared during the transition. Thanks, Steve. Turning to our results. Our base business grew year-over-year in the third quarter with performance rebounding in August and September from the softer volume trends that we saw earlier in the year. In fact, before Hurricane Ian hit in September, we were seeing some of the highest base testing volumes we have ever experienced. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d like to thank our employees for their incredible efforts to restore our labs and PSCs for our patients and customers in the wake of Hurricane Ian while also enduring personal loss of their homes and belongings. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m also grateful to our employees outside of the impacted areas, who stepped up to provide financial support to our colleagues in need. As many of you are aware of Florida is an important state for us. During the quarter, we grew the base business revenues and continue to invest in advanced diagnostics and consumer initiated testing. To help offset inflationary pressures we have continued to pursue our operational excellence strategy and have been closely managing our cost structure through our invigorate initiatives. In the third quarter, total revenues were 2.5 billion. Earnings per share were $2.17 on a reported basis and $2.36 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $502 million. COVID-19 testing revenues were 316 million in the third quarter down 55% from 2021 and down 11% from the previous quarter. After plateauing in June and July, our COVID-19 molecular testing volumes steadily declined. We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to average 10,000 to 15,000 per day in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we continued to make progress executing our two point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Here are some highlights from the quarter. M&A continues to be a driver of growth. We recently announced an outreach lab purchase from Summa Health, a large integrated healthcare delivery system in Ohio. While this is a small acquisition, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a positive indicator. We are seeing that hospital systems are more open to discussions and before the pandemic. Many large and small health systems face substantial financial and labor pressures that make our range of services very attractive. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re pleased with the activity in our M&A pipeline and hope to share additional news with you later this year. We also announced a professional lab services relationship with Lee Health, Southwest Floridaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s primary community owned health system to provide supply chain expertise for five hospitals owned by Lee health and selected outpatient centers. We will also continue to perform reference testing for Lee Health. Our implementation plans have been slightly delayed by Hurricane Ian, though we expect this relationship will have a positive impact on revenue growth in 2023.  Turning now to health plans. Both volumes and revenues continue to grow faster than our overall base business in the quarter. Value based care relationships continue to gain traction. Not only does this yield benefit for health plans in their members, but also it enables us to gain share. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve begun to renew some of our value based contracts with national health plans while continuing to engage and expand our value based footprint with other plans. Value based relationships are appealing to health plans because it helps them reduce the overall cost of care, provides insights to better health outcomes and provides an exceptional value to members. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re on track to meet our goal of realizing 50% of our health plan revenues from value based relationships by the end of next year. Also, as we continue to extend and renegotiate health plan agreements, we see increased volumes and pricing from these contracts. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing a more favorable pricing environment. And over the last two years the majority of our renewals have included stable to positive reimbursement. In advanced diagnostics we saw growth from prenatal genetics and genomic sequencing services in the third quarter. We continued to make investments to strengthen our capabilities to accelerate growth in oncology and hematology, hereditary genetics, genomic sequencing services and pharma services. Just last week, we announced the addition of Mark Gardner, our Senior Vice President of molecular genomics and oncology. In this new position Mark, an established leader in molecular genomics next generation sequencing and oncology diagnostics, is responsible for driving growth and expanding our offerings in these areas. The investments wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re making in consumer initiated testing enabled us to recently launch a new e-commerce platform. The new site is more powerful and consumer friendly with a compelling user experience and a number of enhancements. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re encouraged by the early success of the site in the first few weeks of its launch, and we expect to make further progress in the fourth quarter ending in 2023 toward our goal of $250 million of annual consumer initiated testing revenues by 2025. We also launched a new ad campaign to drive broader awareness of our consumer initiated testing offerings which cover everything from womena\u0302\u0080\u0099s health tests to allergy testing, and sexually transmitted infections. Check out the new site at Questhealth.com and look for the new ads. The second part of our two points strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and cost, thereby driving productivity gains and improving the customer experience. Here are a few examples. As COVID-19 volumes have declined, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve begun to repurpose some of our COVID-19 testing platforms to enhance our quality and reduce costs. Today, 75% of our patients are arriving at PSC with an appointment compared to less than 25% just three years ago. This increased number of appointments allows us to flex our workforce to meet demand within a particular geography, which enables us to serve our patients faster. For patients who walk into a patient service center our new schedule a check in program sets expectations in the waiting room and balances the load for our phlebotomist. Walk-ins now self register when they arrive and learn how long theya\u0302\u0080\u0099ll need to wait. Our average wait time is approximately five minutes, which is roughly half the level since 2019. Finally, we continue to drive the use of automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity gains to help offset inflationary pressures. Now Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll turn it over to Sam who will provide more details on a performance and share more insights on our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022. Yes, thanks and good morning. So let me start and Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll have Sam fill in some color here. So but therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a lot of changes since 2019. And Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll just talk about a few tailwinds and headwinds. from a tailwind standpoint reimbursement has never been better. We were down approximately 50 basis points year-to-date. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s a much better environment without PAMA in 2019 was where we were historically losing over 100 basis points. And then PAMA was on top of that. So we feel much better about price going into 2023. Our base volumes are back above 2019 levels. In fact, it points during the quarter. In September, we exceeded the high point February, January of 2020. So feel good about that. You mentioned investments in CIT. Yes, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099ll be a tailwind going into 2023. We feel good about that. And then as you know, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve made investments in the business, investing in our advanced diagnostics portfolio, and we expect to get above normal growth rates out of that side of our portfolio. Now wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re dealing with some headwinds, as well as you know. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve built into our plan, a third round of PAMA cuts $80 million to $90 million next year COVID, which we didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t obviously have in 2019. We expect going into next year there. Early part of next year, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll be at the 10 to 15 point. And we have some inflation that we certainly didna\u0302\u0080\u0099t see in 2019 thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s running through our business. We estimated $0.05 to $0.08 a quarter and we expect that inflation to continue into the early part of next year. Sam, any other caller? Yes to comments on Jacka\u0302\u0080\u0099s question and Erin first of all, or plan is to gain share. And so one element of gain share is that relationships without plans and we do believe wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re making progress to that progress will continue as we pick up more she are particularly with the Nationals. Just want to make sure we remind you that 50 basis points is not exclusive to commercial payer pricing, but all pricing. So commercial payer pricings within it and that is improved to Jima\u0302\u0080\u0099s comment vastly versus where we were. But we have price pressure with client relationships, with physicians we have price concessions with hospital reference work. So therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s other price concessions in that number. But on the commercial payer side, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s less than 50 basis points that much improved of where it was years ago. Just to remind you all that there is a correlation between COVID volumes that are based business. And so as COVID improves, we believe that could help our base business. And wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve clearly started to see that in Q3 and to some extent, as wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve talked before, we have somewhat of a natural hedge, because of COVID goes up and base softens. We have seen that in the past. And therefore the improving COVID situation should be a tailwind on base growth going forward. And as we said before, most of our major markets have recovered, we still have not seen full recovery in New York City. And we still believe that theya\u0302\u0080\u0099ll gradually step by step improve over the next couple of years. And wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll go back to where we were in 2019. So thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s the only major metropolitan area that we havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t seen full recovery. So from an overall perspective, the COVID direction should be favorable to base. Yes maybe Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll add a couple of comments to Jima\u0302\u0080\u0099s. So just wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not going to give you obviously guidance right now, but just maybe directionally give you some things also to build into, or to think about as you build your model for next year. Expense reductions is an important one, Jim mentioned that. The fact that CIT investments will drive growth in that consumer segment. And so they will be less dilutive, as you look at next year versus this year. The fact that when you think about pricing ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a definitely improving environment for us as wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve said, 50 basis points in Q3. So thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s an additional number that maybe some of you use the 1% pricing negative pricing impact is no longer the case in terms of what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing, because of all the things that we talked about around value based contracts with the health plans. And then when you think about COVID I mean, COVID is obviously the assumption going into 2023 is that ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s 10,000 to 15,000. Therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s variability around that. But thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s our assumption right now. And the 10,000 to 15,000 is so ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s coming down. COVID testing is coming down, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s an improvement in the base business as a result of that. But also the fact that with the PHE ending, at least our assumption is that it ends in January, even though that average reimburse price comes down, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s not a straight impact the margin because we have cost that we incur in the non traditional retail channels right now that will no longer, that we will no longer incur after the end of the PHE emergency. So you can also take you know, the margin on COVID as being completely impacted by that price reimbursed or by that reimbursement decrease. Yes. This is very good question on are we seeing an uptick in patient concession rate or patients unless -- no we are not seeing any impact as of yet on that. In fact, our patient concessions have actually improved rate and has actually improved year-over-year and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to build into next year. We do a lot of things to work this and we work real hard. We have what we call real time adjudication. So, patient comes into our PSE, we take the requisition and we can literally adjudicate that claim x-the payment coming to us. So we know real time what tests on that requisition are going to be approved or denied, and we know what the patient balance is. And then we provide multiple ways for that patient to pay the bill or give us a form of payment so that when the claim is adjudicated, we know how to charge the patient. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re working on things to actually move that whole process upstream. So when the patient makes an appointment, and that requisition is already been delivered to us, because physician has sent it to us electronically, we can do that pre-adjudication, if you will, as the patient is making an appointment online. So even before they come into the PSC we can pre-adjudicate that claim. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to build the capability to do that. And so it improves our PSE productivity as well as gives the patient knowledge of what theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to be billed before they walk into the PSE. So lots of things wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re doing to make it easier to pay to inform the patient. And all of those things help our patient concession rate. Yes. So. Thanks Eric. So as you know, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a lot of things that go into the calculation. So leta\u0302\u0080\u0099s take price per test out, because we already said that was down about 50 basis points. So your math is directionally correct. All of the things that were up about 3.8% in the quarter. there is really three very different types of mix that enter into that. There is clinical mix, business mix and payer mix. And from let me just start with clinical mix. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll just tell you that the investments wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re making in advanced diagnostics are paying off. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re getting a higher mix of molecular and other genetic and advanced based tasks. Hematology was good. Caner testing really good in the quarter. From a business mix standpoint therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a lot of things there. First, from a commercial payer standpoint, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a mix of cap and fee for service, and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll just tell you in the quarter fee per service was better and cap was lost. And if cap was less than, obviously, you got to fix payments. So that certainly helped us. Our health systems business was actually just a pure reference was good in the quarter and that tends to mix up our rep per and then finally therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s payer mix issues. What portion is coming from commercial? What portion is coming from Medicare? What portion is coming from Medicaid? And that was favorable in the quarter. And then finally, CIT, our consumer initiated testing business has a higher revenue per rack. The pricing is better in that market, and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re getting some left from our CIT business. So a lot of factors go into it. But thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s kind of the summary of it."

The entire contents of the call, including the presentation and question-and-answer session that will follow, are the copyrighted property of Quest Diagnostics with all rights reserved. Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.\nShawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I'm joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; Jim Davis, CEO elect; Mark Guinan, Chief Financial Officer; and Sam Samad, our incoming Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will provide non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, healthcare insurer, government, client payer reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular test, the pandemic impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Shawn and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We performed well in the quarter, growing our base business year-over-year while increasing our share of COVID-19 molecular testing since March. As we have said before, we believe demand for COVID-19 molecular testing is not going away anytime soon. It will continue into 2023. Based on our overall performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022, we have raised our full year guidance. We also made very good progress on our leadership transition. Jim will give you an update and take you through our second quarter highlights and then Mark will take you through our financial performance in more detail before we get into your questions. But before I turn it over to Jim, I'd like to say a few words about the saving access to Laboratory Services Act, now called Salsa, the important new federal laboratory legislation recently introduced in Congress as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's recent ruling on our trade associations PAMA lawsuit. We're grateful for the efforts of Senate and House members who introduced this legislation on both sides of the aisle. In our view, Salsa could fix PAMA permanently, setting the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule back on a sustainable path. In 2014, the intent of Congress when passing PAMA was to reform the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule to a single national fee schedule based on private payer rates for the clinical laboratory services. Unfortunately, the first round of data collection failed to collect the data from large significant segments of the marketplace. The result was billions of Medicare cuts over 3 years, with more on their way if Salsa is not passed. Our trade association is coordinated to Congressional Meetings along with public advocacy efforts that involves collaboration with the provider and patient communities. Last week, the D.C. Circuit Court issued a decision in the PAMA lawsuit filed in 2017 by our trade association, ACLA. In short, the court sided with ACLA and called the CMS's exclusion of hospital price data \"arbitrary and capricious.\" Importantly, this case has been rejected for procedural reasons and this is the first opinion based on its merits. Unfortunately, the court is not requiring CMS to recalculate the flawed payment amounts. While disappointing, we believe this favorable ruling will give Congress additional strong grounds to finally fix PAMA's mini flaws by passing Salsa. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Davis.\nJim Davis: Thanks, Steve. Our base business performed well despite softer utilization trends which we believe impacted us and the rest of the health care industry. I'm proud of the efforts our team has made to grow our share of COVID-19 molecular testing since the end of the first quarter. We also ramped our investments to further accelerate growth in the areas of advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. In the quarter, we announced the selection of our next CFO, Sam Samad. Sam joins us from Illumina, where he served as Chief Financial Officer for 5-plus years. As many of you know, he brings a depth of health care experience that will help us in many ways. Prior to Illumina, Sam held several financial and operational leadership roles at Cardinal Health and Eli Lilly and Company. Sam, welcome to Quest Diagnostics.\nSam Samad: Thanks, Jim. It's an honor to join the Quest Diagnostics team. In previous roles, I had the opportunity to observe the many contributions Quest is making to health care. Just arriving less than 2 weeks ago, I've been impressed by the passion and dedication of everyone that I've met so far. I'd like to thank Mark Guinan for his partnership during this transition. I'm excited to be here. Jim, I'll turn it back to you.\nJim Davis: Thanks, Sam and I look forward to working very closely with you. Now, turning to our performance in the second quarter. Total revenues were $2.5 billion. Earnings per share were $1.96 on a reported basis and $2.36 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $402 million. COVID-19 testing revenues were approximately $355 million in the second quarter, down approximately 31% from 2021 and 41% from the previous quarter. In July, with the spread of the BA4 and BA5 variance, we continue to see the demand for COVID-19 molecular testing, consistent with the volumes we reported in June. Our positivity rate has increased since March and approximately 25% of the tests we performed in the first 2 weeks of July were positive. We believe that the COVID-19 trends since March contributed to the softness we observed in the broader health care utilization. As you've seen, we're successfully executing a strategy to increase our share of COVID-19 molecular testing. A key element of our strategy is to increase the number of testing access points through retail relationships. In addition to our CVS and Walmart relationships, we are now also collecting specimens at Rite Aid locations and the number of access points will continue to grow. Approximately half of our COVID-19 volume in the quarter came from retail channels. Quest is proud to have been selected by the CDC to participate in its increasing community access to testing, or ICATT program for COVID-19 testing. Through this program, qualified uninsured individuals can access COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing for zero out-of-pocket costs. In addition, we're pleased to be the provider of COVID-19 PCR testing for qualified insured and uninsured customers of Rite Aid nationwide for zero out-of-pocket expense. We now have approximately 6,000 COVID-19 patient access testing sites through retail relationships as well as our own patient service centers. Through these efforts, we estimate that we are performing approximately 8% of COVID-19 molecular testing in the U.S., up from approximately 4% in March. Finally, the public health emergency was extended into October which will help us maintain our current level of reimbursement. Based on these factors, we raised our COVID-19 revenue guidance for full year 2022 to between $1.15 billion and $1.30 billion. Now, turning to our base business. In the second quarter, we continued to make progress executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Here are some highlights from the quarter. Our M&A funnel remains strong. We are in late-stage discussions with several hospital health systems on the purchase of their laboratory outreach business. This is in addition to our normal conversations we have with C-suite leaders on performing reference testing and providing professional lab services. While this pandemic paused some of these discussions, it has also created opportunities because of the financial and labor pressures that many hospital health systems are facing. We continue to accelerate growth through health plan access. Excluding COVID-19, health plan volumes and revenues grew faster than our overall base business in the quarter. Health plans continue to see the value of working with us. Over the last 2 years, we have renewed 12 national and large regional health plan contracts with price increases. We expect more renewals with price increases this year. And we're proud to be selected as one of the UnitedHealthcare's preferred lab network providers for the fourth consecutive year, providing physicians and patients with improved access, quality and value. Finally, we're pleased to share today that we have renewed our strategic relationship with Florida Blue. Florida continues to be an important large and growing state for us. Earlier this month, the CMS Transparency in Coverage Final Rules became effective to help consumers know the cost of a covered item or service before receiving care. Beginning July 1, 2022, group health plans and issuers of group or individual health insurance are required to post pricing information for covered items and services. We are leveraging that data to ensure patients and employers are aware of the value we offer. This trend will continue to gather momentum as more pricing transparency requirements will go into effect in the next 2 years. We believe that pricing transparency favors Quest Diagnostics which powers affordable care. We do this by offering clinical innovation, enabling better clinical outcomes through our quality, speed and accuracy of test results, improving the patient experience with accessible and easy-to-use patient resources and finally, reducing the cost of care. We continue to ramp our investments in advanced diagnostics capabilities. In the quarter, we saw growth from hematology, prenatal genetics and pharma services. We also introduced Quest AD Detect, a blood test to aid in the early assessment of Alzheimer's disease. We are seeing good early adoption from both primary care physicians and neurologists. Finally, last week, we launched the lab developed molecular test to aid in the detection of monkeypox. The test can differentiate monkeypox from other orthopox viruses and we will be able to perform nearly 30,000 tests a week by the end of July. In addition, we can expand testing to other laboratories in our network to further increase capacity if needed. We continue to see growth in direct-to-consumer testing, thanks to our COVID-19 offerings and more importantly, our base business testing. Within the base business testing category, we saw strong growth from testosterone, comprehensive metabolic panels and Lyme disease. We're excited about upcoming improved digital experience which we expect to debut later this year. We believe this improved experience will help us acquire, convert and retain more customers who visited QuestDirect digital platform. We expect to have much more to say about our improved digital experience before the end of this year. The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and cost, thereby driving productivity gains. We have several initiatives underway to make this happen. Focused on attracting and retaining our people, optimizing our network, automating and digitizing our processes and getting paid for the work we do. Here are three examples. One, we're partnering with universities to help build our pipeline of expertise in medical technology, cytology and histology. We're also teaming up with a learning and development recruiting company to provide lobotomy certifications to prescreened candidates in exchange for a 2-year commitment to work at Quest. Two, our schedule at check-in initiative which encourages patients to make appointments has now expanded to 1,000 of our patient service sites. In one area which has implemented the program, we are seeing a 20% decrease in average wait times as well as an improvement in patient satisfaction. We're also building the payment process into the digital customer experience which frees up our phlebotomists to focus on specimen collection, thereby increasing their capacity and improving the patient-employee experience. Three, we continue to implement digital technology to provide end-to-end specimen tracking, including the arrival patterns that enable load leveling across the network which improves our productivity and provides greater transparency for our clients. We're not immune to the current inflationary environment and are managing through rising fuel and labor costs. Like many companies, higher-than-normal employee turnover in some job categories is impacting our ability to drive further productivity gains. However, these increased costs are in line with our expectations and are built into our guidance. We are expecting another year of solid Invigorate savings and productivity improvements to help offset these pressures. Finally, I'm very proud of our recently released 2021 corporate responsibility report and invite you all to download it. You can find it on our website. Among the highlights, in 2021, we launched our first formal materiality assessment to help identify the most significant ESG topics to the company and our stakeholders. Also, to enhance the level of our ESG disclosures, we began reporting in accordance with the SASB guidelines. We're very proud of the contributions Quest is making to empower better health and grateful to our 50,000 colleagues who are making that vision a reality every day. Now, Mark will provide more details on our performance and share more insights on our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022.\nMark Guinan: Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.45 billion, down 3.8% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 2.9% to $2.1 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 31% to $355 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 3.6% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 1.4% versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 100 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes increased approximately 2% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew less than 1%. As we have seen in prior COVID surges, we experienced some softening of base testing volumes beginning in April as COVID-19 cases began to rise again throughout the spring. COVID-19 testing volumes were stronger than expected during the second quarter. Together with our JV partnership, Sonora Quest, we resulted approximately 3.7 million molecular tests. Quest alone resulted roughly 3.5 million molecular tests, down approximately 1.3 million tests and 2.8 million tests versus the prior year and first quarter, respectively. Our July COVID-19 molecular volumes have been consistent with the volumes we reported in June, averaging roughly 40,000 tests per day, excluding Sonora Quest. Revenue per requisition declined 2.6% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up modestly. As we have highlighted in recent quarters, the pricing environment has improved with unit price reimbursement pressure of less than 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $388 million, or 15.8% of revenues compared to $533 million or 20.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $435 million or 17.7% of revenues compared to $584 million or 22.9% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volume, a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from nontraditional retail channels which carry additional expenses and logistics costs, investments to accelerate growth in our base business and slightly lower average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular tests. In the quarter, approximately half of our COVID-19 molecular volume came through our retail partners versus roughly 1/3 last year. We expect the mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes through this channel to continue to grow in the third quarter. Reported EPS was $1.96 in the quarter compared to $4.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.36 compared to $3.18 last year. Year-to-date cash provided by operations was $882 million in 2022 versus $1.2 billion in the prior year period. Given the limited M&A activity, we repurchased $200 million in stock during the second quarter. Now, turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.5 billion and $9.75 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.35 billion and $8.45 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $1.15 billion and $1.3 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.24 to $8.64 and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.55 to $9.95. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.7 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated 2022 guidance as well as some additional considerations. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average approximately 15,000 to 25,000 tests per day for the rest of the year. As we look toward 2023, we continue to assume our COVID-19 molecular testing run rate in the second half of 2022 continues into next year. Last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through mid-October. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period. While the public health emergency could be renewed beyond October, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance. As Jim noted earlier, we have successfully grown our share of COVID-19 molecular testing through our retail partners which accounted for approximately 50% of our COVID-19 molecular volume in the second quarter. As these retail partnerships continue to expand, we expect the mix through this channel to continue to grow throughout the remainder of the year. We continue to incur incremental costs to serve this channel. As COVID-19 positivity rates remain in the double digits, our ability to pull specimens for COVID-19 molecular testing continues to be limited. As a reminder, we are ramping investments to accelerate growth this year. We spent approximately $70 million in the first half of the year and we expect these investments to continue to ramp in Q3 to support the launch of our new consumer site later this year. A portion of these stand-up IT costs are temporary but variable marketing costs will increase following the launch of the new site. We'll also be adding additional headcount this year to support our consumer offering as well as bioinformatics capabilities within advanced diagnostics. I will now turn it back to Steve.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. As many of you know, this will be Mark's last earnings call as he is retiring next week. Mark, you've been a key member of our leadership team as we have transformed Quest and accelerated its growth. I'm grateful for everything you've done for the company, especially for the last 2.5 years of the pandemic. I would miss your partnership and consult as we navigated many challenges over nearly a decade. I wish you and your family, health and happiness as you approach the next chapter in your life. Thanks.\nMark Guinan: Thanks, Steve. Quest is a special place and it has been an honor to serve as CFO for the last 9 years. Thanks to the analysts and investors on this call. I have enjoyed working with all of you. My family and I are excited for what lies ahead.\nSteve Rusckowski: Thanks, Mark. And to summarize, as Jim shared, we had another good quarter driven by our efforts through share of COVID-19 testing while we believe our base business performed in line with the software utilization trends we're seeing in health care. We have raised our full year guidance based on our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022. Finally, we're grateful for the efforts of Senate and House members who introduced the saving access to Laboratory Services Act and fully support the passage of this important legislation. Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator?\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Mark, congrats on the upcoming retirement and thanks for all the help over the years. So I guess, just my question on the base business, I mean, you called out some of the softness, right? I mean do you guys think that it's more COVID driven with the current mini surge that we're seeing? Or just any color you can share with us on that? And maybe I guess, Steve, taking it a little bit further, how are you thinking about the business today as we face a recession down the road in terms of the defensiveness of the volumes and the business overall as we get past COVID?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, sure. So thanks, Brian, for the question. So as we indicated, we were a little softer in the second quarter where the base business than what we expected in the second quarter. And we do believe there's a relationship, as we have said before, between pickup in COVID infections and the amount of people that are going into their physicians and to some extent, what's happening with hospitals, even though that's a secondary slowdown, if at all. And the second part of your question is longer term with worries about a potential slowdown in our economy and approaching recession. What's our view on that and we're taking a hard look at what happened over the last 10 to 15 years of our business. And things did change quite a bit over the last decade, as you know. The first -- over the last recession, the big -- Great Recession, 2008, we have in parallel with that, the Affordable Care Act. We also had changes with health care policy and we had PAMA, so there's a lot of other effects. And so yes, we do believe there may be some impact in our business related to a slowdown in the economy and the recession. We do believe that we're so essential through the delivery of health care and the need for health care going forward that we believe that utilization will continue to be reasonable throughout any up and down in an economic cycle. So -- but we're taking a look at it and we're seeing if there's any differences this time around, as you know, maybe people were saying this is an unusual set of circumstances given what's happened with health care and what's happened in the economy over the last 2 to 3 years. So Jim, anything you'd like to add to what we see with our base business?\nJim Davis: Yes, Steve, what I would add is, look, we're in close touch with the payers. And the payers have indicated to us and you saw UnitedHealthcare's announcement earlier this week, that they saw softer utilization of health care services as well. In addition to that, we track a group of Quest accounts that we know are 100% loyal to us. We call it our same-store sales analysis. And we noticed in the quarter that it was basically flat, those accounts that are 100% loyal. So, the other thing we look at is just the mix business. And we noticed our general health and wellness panels grew at a lower rate than some of our infectious disease, non-COVID infectious disease and chronic care types of testing that we do. So we -- based on all that information, we come to the conclusion that the base was certainly softer this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: I want to offer my congratulations to Mark and best wishes and welcome, aboard, Sam. Look forward to working with you. Maybe I'll just pivot over to talk about margins. Obviously, within the base business, you've called out some inflationary pressures. They seem like they've been manageable. But you also talked about the Invigorate savings and they're largely offsetting it. I wonder if you could just sort of comment on how you're viewing base business margins? And then I'm assuming also on the COVID-related testing. As long as the PHE is in place, that margin is stable but has there been any reason to think that, that has changed? We get the aggregate margin but I'm wondering about the underlying trends there. If you could just comment on it and how much that factored into your back half guidance outlook as well? Any changes?\nMark Guinan: Thanks, A.J., for the questions. Let me start with COVID. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, when you look at our COVID business, the good news was a lot more volume, a lot more revenue, a lot more dollars of operating margin. However, with that also goes less pooling, a larger mix shift towards the retail outlets which have higher expenses. And then we have had some slight erosion versus last year on average reimbursement a couple of dollars, not anything super significant. So the margin percentage was less but still, its contribution to the bottom line from COVID was much higher. As we look into the back half at this point, we don't know where the positivity rates are going to go but we've not assumed a material change in the amount of pooling. We would expect to continue with the current mix or potentially grow that as a proportion of our total COVID volumes. So within the ranges, that's kind of how we're seeing the balance of the year play out on COVID. So if the positivity rate drops down and the positive rate, I'm looking at Jim here, has been as high as we've seen through the pandemic, now a lot more people are doing rapid antigen testing and so on, we believe that the cases are underreported. But we believe that the prevalence of COVID right now is extremely high. And so in the earlier answer that we provided to Brian around the base business, there has been a historical negative correlation between those. And we do believe that the base business has absolutely been impacted by the surge in COVID. We just aren't sure how long it will last. On the base business, we've shared that as we built our plan and the ranges for 2022, we built in a higher SWB, salary work benefits assumption that was in our guidance. And certainly, that's something we control and that's really within expectations. We have a couple of billion dollars that we have long-term contracts. And so really not exposed to inflation in a short window for that. But then we have some other costs where we don't have long-term contracts and there are things that everybody is familiar with and you've heard from other companies as well, things like fuel, things like housekeeping, security, temporary labor. And so those areas have been a little more inflationary than we would have anticipated going into the year. The good news is those are in our results year-to-date during our guidance. We're not expecting that to go away immediately. We certainly hope it's not long-term inflation unlike where if you have wage inflation, you generally expect will continue. If you add contractual inflation with your key suppliers around reagents and other things that might be longer term as well or certainly a couple of years. We don't know how long this spike is going to last. But I can tell you, it's probably like $0.05 to $0.08 a quarter in the first half and we're not expecting that to change. We hope it might but in the guidance that we provided. So hopefully, that's helpful, A.J.\nSteve Rusckowski: And A.J., just so it's clear. You all know that the Emergency Act has been extended and so we're assuming in our guidance that will be extended through October but we're not assuming in our guidance that it extends past October until we have certainty around that, okay? So that is the assumption and what we've just provided for guidance for the remainder of the year. And I think since you asked, A.J., Jim, why don't you comment a little bit about the opportunities we still see around the bigger rate and you mentioned in our opening remarks about the things we have changed. But why don't you chat a little bit about why we're still bullish on the prospects of improving productivity.\nJim Davis: Yes. So A.J., as we've talked in the past, there's still certainly a lot of opportunity around automation of manual processes in the laboratory. I touched on in my comments around some of the automated check-in procedures. So we've long had appointment scheduling. What we've added recently is when a patient walks into the PSC without an appointment, you actually go to the check in and you -- and if the wait room is full, you schedule an appointment at that point. And what we've seen is it really does help productivity in the PSC, as well as if the patient leaves, they may not come back to Quest. If they make an appointment to come back in 2 hours or the next day, we feel like the patient retention is better. But automation, the use of artificial intelligence in terms of readouts of manual curves and laboratories, all of that work continues. And then I'd tell you, the other thing that will help continue to drive productivity is our work around retention of our employees. So our productivity, like all companies, we're seeing a much higher increase in turnover. We feel like it is stabilized, albeit at a higher point. So as we now drive retention higher and turnover lower that will certainly help our productivity efforts in the back half of the year.\nMark Guinan: And I just want to add one thing about peace in the back half. Steve talked about the potential for the PHE to not be extended which at this point, we're not assuming it does extend. But I want to remind people that the price drop is not a full margin drop because when we get to beyond the PHE, first off, there's not absolute certainty but most people would expect the positivity rate will be significantly lower. We can pool a lot more. So we can get some margin offset there dollar-wise. And then, the second one is that the retail relationships that we have will change in the structure. We know how that's going to work. And basically, the significant costs we're incurring right now to get that volume for the retail outlets will go away because it's only permitted under the PHE. It's complicated but it will go away. So while the value per requisition will drop to whatever price we end up with and people have talked about the CMS rate that was originally published and certainly, that's potential, over time, that's not all a margin hit because there's some other costs that go away. So we still will make a decent percentage margin, certainly fewer dollars per patient encounter. But I just want to make sure people are clear that COVID profitability doesn't fall completely off the cliff when the PHE goes away.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: First, Sam, congrats. I think you're going to be a great for the Quest. And Mark, of course, really enjoyed working together. But before you go, I do have more margin questions for you here.\nMark Guinan: Let me go otherwise, Jack, Thanks.\nJack Meehan: Of course. So specifically, can you just talk about what was the COVID testing margin in the quarter? Or how did it compare to the overall margin? And I guess what I'm trying to get into is just like how much of the sequential step down in earnings might have been related to the margin impacts you've talked about?\nMark Guinan: Yes. So Jack, as you know, we don't provide specific margins on subsegments of our business. But what I can give you directionally is I referred to half of our volume coming from retail channels or nontraditional channels and we talked about dollar-wise, what the incremental cost per counter is there. A year ago, in the second quarter, it was about 1/3 of our volume. So you can see that's pretty significant. In the second quarter last year, we did quite a bit of pooling and that's varied in the interim quarters between that and now but there was quite a bit of pooling last year because the positivity rate had fallen -- very well. I think many of us by June of last year were thinking this might have been behind us before Delta hit us. And this quarter, we expected in our plans to do quite a bit of pooling but in reality, it was not a large amount. So that should give you a little bit of idea. The other thing I did mention a couple of dollars erosion on the average reimbursement. So I think you got all the pieces, not going to provide a specific number but that should help you understand. But I think the key thing is that the dollars we earned off COVID was much better than our plans. And that's -- and we expect it to continue and that's why we're rising guidance. So while the percentage was worse, the dollar bottom line was better.\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes, Jack, as you know, in Q1, we did about $600 million worth of COVID. And in the second quarter that we're talking about right now, it was roughly $350 million. So that was a material change in COVID. And as Mark has gone through, there's a lot more dynamics in what the margin is in COVID. But essentially, that sequential compare and our margin drop is primarily related to the drop in COVID testing.\nJack Meehan: Got it. If I can squeeze in one more on the core business. What are your expectations for merit increases and SW&B this year? Have that changed at all?\nSteve Rusckowski: Jim, do you want to take that?\nJim Davis: No, it hasn't changed at all, Jack. We said 3% to 4% for the year. We're still within that guidance. We've already provided the merit increase for the year. We do that annually in the April time frame. So it's already in the Q2 numbers for sure.\nMark Guinan: Yes. As Jim referenced, the vast majority of our increase has already taken place. Certainly, like all other companies, we have some off-cycle adjustments based on promotions and other things. But most of the \"inflationary headwinds\" in SWB were incurred in the second quarter. So if you look sequentially, that's one of the drivers of margin reduction first quarter to second quarter. That's been a historical event as well. That's not new. But we don't anticipate going forward to see significant inflation beyond kind of the run rate we were on in Q2.\nSteve Rusckowski: Jim and I actually in a couple of financial conferences try to dimensionalize what's going on with our wage bill. And we talked about of the 50,000 people that the most pressure we see is what there really are real frontline people and they're primarily what we call specimen processors. When the specimens come into our laboratories, they do the sorting, it's a tough job. It's at night and we're paying them, we think, fairly and we've increased that for their hourly wages. And the second is couriers. And to give you an idea because it is the area of most pressure, roughly, it's about 10% to 11% of our workforce salary, okay? So -- and at the same time, it represents a larger percentage of our workforce count of the 50,000 people. So that's where we have the most pressure. So even if that number went up, considerably, you get an idea of the impact that would have on our margins. So that's where we see the most pressure, okay?\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Sam, looking forward to continue to work with you and not to put you on the spot on your first call here. But I'm sure on the way in, as you know, there's a lot of questions as you've seen on this call already in terms of the margin and the margin profile going into kind of next year as we work our way through kind of the high margin COVID coming out, some of the expenses around DTC and retail, wage inflation. I guess when you came in and Mark, feel free in to chime in obviously but Sam, I guess how did you get comfortable with that? It would just be helpful maybe to hear your perspective on that as I'm sure it was a key consideration, something you dug into on your way in and I know investors are hyper focused on that piece as well. So if you're willing, I would love to hear your general thoughts on kind of how we work our way through the margin side as we kind of work our way into next year.\nSam Samad: Yes. Patrick, thanks for the welcome and I look forward to working with you and the rest of the folks on the call as well. Listen, it's really early days. I've been here in -- I'm in my second week here. So all I can tell you is coming in, obviously, we're in a challenging environment right now. But Quest has an incredible reputation with incredible people that really provide a significant value to health care. So I've been so far really impressed with the passion that I've seen people here, the knowledge and the contributions that I think we can make in health care. So I'm going to punt a little bit on your question because it's really early days and really ask Mark to more comment on it but I'm very excited about how we can work through these challenges. But it's really early days, Patrick. I'm in my second week here. So I'll let maybe Mark talk about it more.\nMark Guinan: Yes. So Patrick, appreciate the question. We know where people's heads are at right now around the business and that's where ours are as well. So I can assure you we're spending a lot of time on that. We've spent a lot of time on that. There's a number of things that we generally control. And then there are some things that are a little bit less in our control. So we do our best to forecast those things. We put together ranges. And then we -- I think and believe we're very transparent with you about how those things play out. So you get a sense of, okay, well, what really is going on in the business? And because of that, I believe that, generally, we've not surprised people. And we've given you delivered on your expectations. We've given you timely updates. We've given you interim information. And based on my time with Sam and I think the team here, I would expect that to continue. So you would expect that with my departure that we're not going to change the way we talk to, the way we share, give all those updates. I think everybody appreciates what a great job Shawn does and know they can call them any time, any place and get him and he'll be as transparent as possible. So really, I think what it comes down to is, I believe we're focused on the right things. And also, I believe we do our best job of being as transparent as possible around all those key drivers.\nPatrick Donnelly: Yes, that's helpful. I appreciate it guys. And then Steve, maybe a quick one. You've continued to talk about more constructive conversations with some of the covering lives and payers. Can you just talk about, I guess, the kind of outlook on pricing? It seems as confident as you guys have sounded on that front in years. Maybe just talk about how you're feeling on the pricing side given some of those payer conversations?\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So thanks for the question. And we are very pleased with the progress we have made with all payers and where we are today versus when I started which was over 10 years ago. We've got a network now that is the strongest network that we've ever had. And I would say our relationship with all the significant payers, national and regional is very strong. And they are increasingly realizing that it's good for their membership and good for their competitiveness in the market to have us in the network and we bring a lot of value. And so we're entirely focused on what we call powering affordable care which is consistent with what Jim has driven in the company around making sure that we have great quality, great service and a great experience. And you heard earlier from Jim as we continue to push on just working smarter and by working smarter, we're getting more productivity but we're also going to have a better product. And payers understand that. And so as Jim mentioned, we have gotten some increases from the payers over the last several negotiation rounds. We continue to believe that is something we're going to continue to push for because we do bring a lot of value in the marketplace. And we're very competitive in the marketplace. And so if you look at the price effect that we saw in the quarter and what we have typically said in the past historically, remember, historically, we said you should plan at about 100 basis points with the price effect. Well, in this quarter, in the last quarter, we've actually saw less than that. And that's the best position we bet in. And I will share within that envelope, the commercial payer portion of it is significantly less than where we've been historically. But we still see pressure with price, with our hospital business, with our client bill business and that's in that envelope as well. But on the commercial payer side, we're in a very different place than we were before. And I'll share with you a part of Jim and I on my transition is Jim and I are going into the nationals and the regional payers and we're talking about what we've done in the past and more importantly, what we're doing in the future. We just had a meeting last week with one of the national payers and they see us as a much more significant player in the marketplace than what people think about us as which is a laboratory. We're much more of the lab. We actually help them improve the value of health care going forward. So a much better place than where we were in a good place right now.\nMark Guinan: And so what I will add is that we really moved the needle on commercial. Over the last couple of years, we've talked about more pricing pressure in the client bill which is, as Steve referenced the hospital and then in some cases, where we contract directly with physicians. But instead of being a headwind on price, I will tell you that starting next year and going forward, I would expect that -- to be at least neutral, if not a tailwind. So we've moved it from a major headwind to be at least neutral and more likely positive. So wanted to dimensionalize a little more why you're hearing the positive comments for us. And it's in really recognition of what Steve said which is our strategic value to them. We're not a commoditized provider of a laboratory result. There's so much more to how we're helping them and then these value-based contracts that we referenced were based on performance, we can earn a better payment for ourselves. And so because of that, we really, really moved the environment and the relationships with the commercial payers.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: Mark, it's a pleasure working with you over these years. And Sam, I look forward to working with you in the future. Quick two part on the inflation side. So the first one is a follow-up on the pricing question that you just gave. Can you quantify what the better commercial rates are for 2023 because you priority locked it in at this point versus 2022? And then a follow-up on A.J.'s question just to make sure I understand, you were seeing an additional $0.05 to $0.08 of inflationary pressures. Was that more or less than you expected when you guys gave guidance on the fourth quarter call? And then on previous calls, you talked about sort of the 2023 EPS of $8.50. Should we add those inflationary pressures against that $8.50? Or can you offset those with increased efficiency as well as the new recent COVID retail agreements you've done?\nMark Guinan: Well, thanks for all the questions, Pito. I'll start with 2023. We've not locked down our plan. And if we did, we generally don't give specific guidance until our fourth quarter earnings call. And I'll leave it to the management team. I'll be leaving exactly when they decide to do that but we're not going to comment any specifics around 2023. In terms of the amount of the increases, again, I'm not going to dimensionalize. We don't have a planned lockdown. But we have enough contracts that are already set for next year and enough progress on some that are either, as we referenced like Florida Blue or some others that are getting close to being locked down for renewal that I have confidence to say what I said which is, this is not going to be a next year for us on a price perspective...\nSteve Rusckowski: So just to add to that, so what you're hearing from us is, yes, we hear your comments about inflation. And yes, we have inflationary pressure. And yes, we're managing that. But what you're also hearing from us is we're in a better price position than we've been in. You need to think about that too and thinking about the prospect of what we're going to do in '23. We're not going to provide guidance. But we still feel confident with what we shared at Investor Day in 2021 around the prospects of what we're going to do going forward.\nMark Guinan: And yes, so I was going to continue that what you're hearing from us is what's happening now, Pito. And the $0.05 to $0.08 is more inflation than we would have anticipated. However, other things have changed as well. Most notably, we did a lot more COVID. So we delivered a lot more earnings. So just like we don't expect the high level of COVID and we could be wrong to expect and continue into 2023. Also, we'd be really disappointed if the inflation we're seeing in the noncontracted areas were to carry to 2023. But even if it does, we've got multiple pieces that are moving, including a better pricing environment in the commercial book. So in no way, shape or form, are we saying that when you put all these together, that, that $8.50 or in that range is not something we're still confident in.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Mark, wishing you best of luck in the future and really enjoyed working with you. So thank you for all the color always and your patience. In terms of the question, I just want to go back to the utilization environment. I mean you gave some color there but what we're hearing from the managed care companies is that the softness that they're seeing is the ER visits and inpatient admissions which shouldn't really have an impact on lab testing, right, if it's more outside the four walls of the hospitals. So can you maybe give us color on where are you seeing softness in utilization by geography and maybe by end market, i.e., what type of test? And how do you think about it, right, sort of 2.5 years into the pandemic? What's structural in the software utilization versus transition in your view?\nMark Guinan: If I can just start quickly and then I'll pass it on to Jim. So Ricky, our source is not just seeing their medical loss ratios. But I'd point to two things in addition to what Jim talked about earlier which is our same-store sales as we call it. So one is we actually get data from the payers, okay, in total. So we know how many patient encounters they had for laboratory work. We know what our volume was and we can see that. The good news is we continue to gain share in those commercial books. However, we continue to see their total volume has been down, certainly in the second quarter. So it's payer data that's being provided by them to us that is the confidence to say, utilization has dipped in our space. The other one is I'd point to the  data which is based on billings of other independent labs. And if you look at that, that certainly suggests that utilization is down. So while you may be hearing its emergency room and inpatient, the data that we have and the best data we have also suggests that the market in which we operate is also depressed in the second quarter.\nSteve Rusckowski: And the second part is, remember COVID and we're 2 years into it. And every time COVID infections go up, our base business comes down some. And if you think about a physician and what they need to do to run their offices and as you know, a large portion of our business is through physicians in their offices, if there's call outs of their staff or if their patients are missing their appointments because they are now infected, it affects volume. So there's no question there's a correlation. And the good news for us is when that happens, our COVID business goes up, right? So Jim, why should...\nJim Davis: Ricky, the last thing I'd say is we're not immune to hospital. The inpatient work -- remember, we get $1 billion a year in reference work. We have another $0.5 billion in PLS. So when inpatient and outpatient procedures are down, that certainly does affect our business on the health system, hospital side. On the physician office side, again, we closely look at a set of accounts spread across the country that we know are 100% loyal to Quest and we measure that we call it same-store sales. Again, our general health and wellness panels from a mix standpoint, were certainly lower than some of our chronic disease panels in the quarter. And then the last thing, geographic mix. We've talked and it hasn't changed dramatically that our book of business in New York City is down still low to mid-double digits. On the other hand, we see incredibly strong growth in the southern part of the country, in the southeast portion as well as the southwest and parts of the West. So if there's been a population migration out of New York City into the southeast, then we're certainly seeing some of that in our business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is John  on for Derik. And thanks for all the colors and thanks for being out the initiatives for renew  you were going to ask. But in addition to that and in addition to the price increases you're expecting and the plan to clamp down the employee turnover, how should we think about the incremental spend in 2023? Are you thinking about ramping these down to offset the inflationary pressure? And on PAMA, could you just remind us what your expectations are in '23, especially if nothing else happens on the legislative front?\nJim Davis: Yes. So in terms of 2023, as Mark said, there's a lot of moving parts at this point. We're committed to investments in advanced diagnostics. We're committed to investments in our consumer direct consumer initiated testing business. Obviously, we can modulate those things if we see inflation getting worse. But at this point, we can't give you any further guidance than what we've given you around those. We're committed to advanced diagnostics, we're committed to our clinical -- our consumer direct -- consumer-initiated testing business. In terms...\nSteve Rusckowski: So just to add to that, because we've commented on this before, it's important to think about this as you think about '23. We started to make investments in 2020 to accelerate growth beyond what we had already invested in to accelerate growth. So think about '20 and '21 and now we're at to '22. And we obviously would not make investments unless we thought there would be a return. And so therefore, you have heard from us, you're seeing growth rates in advanced diagnostics that have come up, you've heard about us feeling good about our consumer-initiated testing, growing faster than we have seen growing in the past. And as you think about '23, you should think about the improvements you're going to see in those two businesses in relationship with that in what we invested. And so therefore, you should not think about this as headwinds because you really think about it as tailwinds because we will get a return on those investments we made over the last several years. Jim?\nJim Davis: Yes. You asked about PAMA. And we've said that it's in our 2023 guidance outlook that we provided at this point and we've said it's about a $90 million headwind.\nMark Guinan: So the only thing I would add is that, to Steve's point, when you ask our investments ramping down, I think there's two ways to think of investments. One is what's the P&L net impact and what is the level of spend. So we, at Investor Day, talked about growing our direct consumer business to $0.5 billion by 2025. That is still our intention. So as you can imagine, over the next several years, including 2023, we're expecting significant revenue growth. And in order to drive that revenue growth, we believe we need to spend more. However, the good news is that a lot of 2020 and 2021 was pre-revenue, pre-contribution margin. And as we go ahead, we would expect the net impact to actually be less and to be less of a headwind. So really, we're going to be investing less on the bottom line but spending more money to drive that accelerated growth. And then obviously, when we get to the scale and size that we're aspiring to, then we expect a healthy margin on that business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Larew with William Blair.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is actually Madelin Malman  on for Matt Larew. Just going off of the previous question for your investments into the base business. I know previously, you've given a number around $160 million for this year. Do you anticipate it's still being about that? Has inflation driven that cost higher? Any color you have there? And then my other question, just speaking to your investments in advanced diagnostics. You mentioned that you are ahead of schedule for your anticipated 8% growth. Is that still the case?\nMark Guinan: Sure. So let me take part of it, then I'm sure either Steve or Jim will jump in. So first of all, inflation really hasn't impacted the level of investment in a material way. And we're on track to spend about what we told you previously. As I referenced a minute ago, we haven't put our final plans together. But at this point, I would expect we're going to spend more next year. And we're going to spend more in marketing but we're going to spend a lot less and not much at all in the IT platform creation. So it's really going to be tied a very high variable cost and highly tied to revenue growth and we'll monitor, as Jim says and I'm sure Sam and Jim will be all over is to make sure we're making the progress and to make sure we don't get the spending ahead of ourselves. But if we do what we expect to do and we need to do to get to $0.5 billion by 2025, the spending will continue to go up. The only other dimension I want to mention here is because when we talk about investments in the base business, there's a little nuance here. Advanced diagnostics absolutely is the base business. But really this consumer business is new. So while a lot of the work we do is similar to what we've done historically in our base business, it's really a new business category or opportunity. And some of it may cannibalize what would have otherwise come through our traditional channels. But we do believe that a lot of it is actually incremental to the overall amount of volume that we perform. Jim or Steve, you want to...\nSteve Rusckowski: Yes. So as you know, we don't generally give you numbers every quarter about different segments of our business. In advanced diagnostics, we generally give you an annual update and we'll do that again. But we keep on indicating that we believe we are making progress of getting to a higher level of growth, as we indicated in our Investor Day in '21. We feel good about the progress. And we gave you a number in the beginning of the year. And the same is true about our consumer initiated testing. We periodically give you an update to show that we're making progress. So we're feeling good about the investments made, the returns we'll get. And again, you should see more returns in our '23 guidance or the expectations around that because we believe they still remain to be good opportunities.\nJim Davis: And just to clarify, the target that we outlined at the Investor Day for the direct-to-consumer business was $250 million by 2025.\nMark Guinan: My apologies.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: So can you spend a minute talking about the monkeypox market? You flagged in your prepared remarks that Quest was 1 of the 5 labs that was selected by the CDC to expand testing capacity and you guys are going to have roughly 30,000 testing capacity for a week. So can you just walk us through the market opportunity there? And then is this contemplated in the guidance at all?\nSteve Rusckowski: Jim will handle that.\nJim Davis: Yes. So at this point, it's hard to anticipate what the market opportunity has been or will be. I can tell you, our testing volumes at this point are modest. If we've done 500, 600 tests that would be on the high side. However, it is growing. And we do see growth. We've only had the test up and running for 2 weeks. And over that 2-week period, it's grown day by day. Right now, we're not yet approved for New York state. We expect that to happen within the next week or 2. I'm sure you're reading that, that is where the major outbreak is in New York City. So we would expect to participate in that market. But most of our volume at this point is coming actually off of the West Coast. And so we'll keep you updated on what we're seeing.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then in line of the  environment, can you just walk us through some initial color on how you're considering use of cash between share repurchases, dividends and then M&A?\nMark Guinan: Sure. So we're going to continue with what we've done. And what that is, is that between the dividend and we've already gotten there this year with the share repurchases to deliver a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And with the $1.7 billion guidance and $400 million of capital, says at least $650 million between the dividend share repurchases and we already covered that. As we've also shared, we rather do M&A than share repurchases because we have some very rigorous financial parameters around the deals that we do. And so it's really going to be situational quarter-by-quarter. It may be different. Jim referenced that we have a deep pipeline and actually also commented that we have some negotiations that are well advanced. So I think we'd all be very disappointed if we didn't execute some deals before the end of the year. Don't know the exact timing of those. But certainly, as I said, I'd rather spend more on M&A and I know Steve would and you'll hear from Sam and Jim as they take over the reins, their view but I wouldn't expect it to materially change. So really no change to what we've done in the past. And at this point, no specific plans for cash deployment because we're really -- it's really dependent on that progression of the M&A.\nSteve Rusckowski: Okay. So thank you, everyone. And again, thank you, Mark, for your time here at Quest. We're going to miss you and we wish you well. So thanks, everyone, for joining the call. We appreciate all your questions and support and we'll see you in our travels. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics second quarter 2022 conference call.

Just arriving less than 2 weeks ago, I've been impressed by the passion and dedication of everyone that I've met so far. I'd like to thank Mark Guinan for his partnership during this transition. I'm excited to be here. Jim, I'll turn it back to you. Yes. Patrick, thanks for the welcome and I look forward to working with you and the rest of the folks on the call as well. Listen, it's really early days. I've been here in -- I'm in my second week here. So all I can tell you is coming in, obviously, we're in a challenging environment right now. But Quest has an incredible reputation with incredible people that really provide a significant value to health care. So I've been so far really impressed with the passion that I've seen people here, the knowledge and the contributions that I think we can make in health care. So I'm going to punt a little bit on your question because it's really early days and really ask Mark to more comment on it but I'm very excited about how we can work through these challenges. But it's really early days, Patrick. I'm in my second week here. So I'll let maybe Mark talk about it more."

            "name": "Steve Rusckowski",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We performed well in the quarter, growing our base business year-over-year while increasing our share of COVID-19 molecular testing since March. As we have said before, we believe demand for COVID-19 molecular testing is not going away anytime soon. It will continue into 2023. Based on our overall performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022, we have raised our full year guidance. We also made very good progress on our leadership transition. Jim will give you an update and take you through our second quarter highlights and then Mark will take you through our financial performance in more detail before we get into your questions. But before I turn it over to Jim, I'd like to say a few words about the saving access to Laboratory Services Act, now called Salsa, the important new federal laboratory legislation recently introduced in Congress as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's recent ruling on our trade associations PAMA lawsuit. We're grateful for the efforts of Senate and House members who introduced this legislation on both sides of the aisle. In our view, Salsa could fix PAMA permanently, setting the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule back on a sustainable path. In 2014, the intent of Congress when passing PAMA was to reform the Medicare clinical lab fee schedule to a single national fee schedule based on private payer rates for the clinical laboratory services. Unfortunately, the first round of data collection failed to collect the data from large significant segments of the marketplace. The result was billions of Medicare cuts over 3 years, with more on their way if Salsa is not passed. Our trade association is coordinated to Congressional Meetings along with public advocacy efforts that involves collaboration with the provider and patient communities. Last week, the D.C. Circuit Court issued a decision in the PAMA lawsuit filed in 2017 by our trade association, ACLA. In short, the court sided with ACLA and called the CMS's exclusion of hospital price data \"arbitrary and capricious.\" Importantly, this case has been rejected for procedural reasons and this is the first opinion based on its merits. Unfortunately, the court is not requiring CMS to recalculate the flawed payment amounts. While disappointing, we believe this favorable ruling will give Congress additional strong grounds to finally fix PAMA's mini flaws by passing Salsa. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Davis. Thanks, Mark. As many of you know, this will be Mark's last earnings call as he is retiring next week. Mark, you've been a key member of our leadership team as we have transformed Quest and accelerated its growth. I'm grateful for everything you've done for the company, especially for the last 2.5 years of the pandemic. I would miss your partnership and consult as we navigated many challenges over nearly a decade. I wish you and your family, health and happiness as you approach the next chapter in your life. Thanks. Thanks, Mark. And to summarize, as Jim shared, we had another good quarter driven by our efforts through share of COVID-19 testing while we believe our base business performed in line with the software utilization trends we're seeing in health care. We have raised our full year guidance based on our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022. Finally, we're grateful for the efforts of Senate and House members who introduced the saving access to Laboratory Services Act and fully support the passage of this important legislation. Now, we'd be happy to take any of your questions. Operator? Yes, sure. So thanks, Brian, for the question. So as we indicated, we were a little softer in the second quarter where the base business than what we expected in the second quarter. And we do believe there's a relationship, as we have said before, between pickup in COVID infections and the amount of people that are going into their physicians and to some extent, what's happening with hospitals, even though that's a secondary slowdown, if at all. And the second part of your question is longer term with worries about a potential slowdown in our economy and approaching recession. What's our view on that and we're taking a hard look at what happened over the last 10 to 15 years of our business. And things did change quite a bit over the last decade, as you know. The first -- over the last recession, the big -- Great Recession, 2008, we have in parallel with that, the Affordable Care Act. We also had changes with health care policy and we had PAMA, so there's a lot of other effects. And so yes, we do believe there may be some impact in our business related to a slowdown in the economy and the recession. We do believe that we're so essential through the delivery of health care and the need for health care going forward that we believe that utilization will continue to be reasonable throughout any up and down in an economic cycle. So -- but we're taking a look at it and we're seeing if there's any differences this time around, as you know, maybe people were saying this is an unusual set of circumstances given what's happened with health care and what's happened in the economy over the last 2 to 3 years. So Jim, anything you'd like to add to what we see with our base business? And A.J., just so it's clear. You all know that the Emergency Act has been extended and so we're assuming in our guidance that will be extended through October but we're not assuming in our guidance that it extends past October until we have certainty around that, okay? So that is the assumption and what we've just provided for guidance for the remainder of the year. And I think since you asked, A.J., Jim, why don't you comment a little bit about the opportunities we still see around the bigger rate and you mentioned in our opening remarks about the things we have changed. But why don't you chat a little bit about why we're still bullish on the prospects of improving productivity. Yes, Jack, as you know, in Q1, we did about $600 million worth of COVID. And in the second quarter that we're talking about right now, it was roughly $350 million. So that was a material change in COVID. And as Mark has gone through, there's a lot more dynamics in what the margin is in COVID. But essentially, that sequential compare and our margin drop is primarily related to the drop in COVID testing. Jim, do you want to take that? Jim and I actually in a couple of financial conferences try to dimensionalize what's going on with our wage bill. And we talked about of the 50,000 people that the most pressure we see is what there really are real frontline people and they're primarily what we call specimen processors. When the specimens come into our laboratories, they do the sorting, it's a tough job. It's at night and we're paying them, we think, fairly and we've increased that for their hourly wages. And the second is couriers. And to give you an idea because it is the area of most pressure, roughly, it's about 10% to 11% of our workforce salary, okay? So -- and at the same time, it represents a larger percentage of our workforce count of the 50,000 people. So that's where we have the most pressure. So even if that number went up, considerably, you get an idea of the impact that would have on our margins. So that's where we see the most pressure, okay? Yes. So thanks for the question. And we are very pleased with the progress we have made with all payers and where we are today versus when I started which was over 10 years ago. We've got a network now that is the strongest network that we've ever had. And I would say our relationship with all the significant payers, national and regional is very strong. And they are increasingly realizing that it's good for their membership and good for their competitiveness in the market to have us in the network and we bring a lot of value. And so we're entirely focused on what we call powering affordable care which is consistent with what Jim has driven in the company around making sure that we have great quality, great service and a great experience. And you heard earlier from Jim as we continue to push on just working smarter and by working smarter, we're getting more productivity but we're also going to have a better product. And payers understand that. And so as Jim mentioned, we have gotten some increases from the payers over the last several negotiation rounds. We continue to believe that is something we're going to continue to push for because we do bring a lot of value in the marketplace. And we're very competitive in the marketplace. And so if you look at the price effect that we saw in the quarter and what we have typically said in the past historically, remember, historically, we said you should plan at about 100 basis points with the price effect. Well, in this quarter, in the last quarter, we've actually saw less than that. And that's the best position we bet in. And I will share within that envelope, the commercial payer portion of it is significantly less than where we've been historically. But we still see pressure with price, with our hospital business, with our client bill business and that's in that envelope as well. But on the commercial payer side, we're in a very different place than we were before. And I'll share with you a part of Jim and I on my transition is Jim and I are going into the nationals and the regional payers and we're talking about what we've done in the past and more importantly, what we're doing in the future. We just had a meeting last week with one of the national payers and they see us as a much more significant player in the marketplace than what people think about us as which is a laboratory. We're much more of the lab. We actually help them improve the value of health care going forward. So a much better place than where we were in a good place right now. So just to add to that, so what you're hearing from us is, yes, we hear your comments about inflation. And yes, we have inflationary pressure. And yes, we're managing that. But what you're also hearing from us is we're in a better price position than we've been in. You need to think about that too and thinking about the prospect of what we're going to do in '23. We're not going to provide guidance. But we still feel confident with what we shared at Investor Day in 2021 around the prospects of what we're going to do going forward. And the second part is, remember COVID and we're 2 years into it. And every time COVID infections go up, our base business comes down some. And if you think about a physician and what they need to do to run their offices and as you know, a large portion of our business is through physicians in their offices, if there's call outs of their staff or if their patients are missing their appointments because they are now infected, it affects volume. So there's no question there's a correlation. And the good news for us is when that happens, our COVID business goes up, right? So Jim, why should... So just to add to that, because we've commented on this before, it's important to think about this as you think about '23. We started to make investments in 2020 to accelerate growth beyond what we had already invested in to accelerate growth. So think about '20 and '21 and now we're at to '22. And we obviously would not make investments unless we thought there would be a return. And so therefore, you have heard from us, you're seeing growth rates in advanced diagnostics that have come up, you've heard about us feeling good about our consumer-initiated testing, growing faster than we have seen growing in the past. And as you think about '23, you should think about the improvements you're going to see in those two businesses in relationship with that in what we invested.

So we're feeling good about the investments made, the returns we'll get. And again, you should see more returns in our '23 guidance or the expectations around that because we believe they still remain to be good opportunities. Jim will handle that. Okay. So thank you, everyone. And again, thank you, Mark, for your time here at Quest. We're going to miss you and we wish you well. So thanks, everyone, for joining the call. We appreciate all your questions and support and we'll see you in our travels. Have a good day."

Base business revenues grew 2.9% to $2.1 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 31% to $355 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 3.6% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the second quarter of 2021, partially offset by growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions declined 1.4% versus the prior year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 100 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes increased approximately 2% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew less than 1%. As we have seen in prior COVID surges, we experienced some softening of base testing volumes beginning in April as COVID-19 cases began to rise again throughout the spring. COVID-19 testing volumes were stronger than expected during the second quarter. Together with our JV partnership, Sonora Quest, we resulted approximately 3.7 million molecular tests. Quest alone resulted roughly 3.5 million molecular tests, down approximately 1.3 million tests and 2.8 million tests versus the prior year and first quarter, respectively. Our July COVID-19 molecular volumes have been consistent with the volumes we reported in June, averaging roughly 40,000 tests per day, excluding Sonora Quest. Revenue per requisition declined 2.6% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up modestly. As we have highlighted in recent quarters, the pricing environment has improved with unit price reimbursement pressure of less than 50 basis points in the quarter. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $388 million, or 15.8% of revenues compared to $533 million or 20.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $435 million or 17.7% of revenues compared to $584 million or 22.9% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volume, a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from nontraditional retail channels which carry additional expenses and logistics costs, investments to accelerate growth in our base business and slightly lower average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular tests. In the quarter, approximately half of our COVID-19 molecular volume came through our retail partners versus roughly 1/3 last year. We expect the mix of COVID-19 molecular volumes through this channel to continue to grow in the third quarter. Reported EPS was $1.96 in the quarter compared to $4.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.36 compared to $3.18 last year. Year-to-date cash provided by operations was $882 million in 2022 versus $1.2 billion in the prior year period. Given the limited M&A activity, we repurchased $200 million in stock during the second quarter. Now, turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.5 billion and $9.75 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.35 billion and $8.45 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $1.15 billion and $1.3 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $8.24 to $8.64 and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $9.55 to $9.95. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least $1.7 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated 2022 guidance as well as some additional considerations. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average approximately 15,000 to 25,000 tests per day for the rest of the year. As we look toward 2023, we continue to assume our COVID-19 molecular testing run rate in the second half of 2022 continues into next year. Last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through mid-October. We assume average reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period. While the public health emergency could be renewed beyond October, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance. As Jim noted earlier, we have successfully grown our share of COVID-19 molecular testing through our retail partners which accounted for approximately 50% of our COVID-19 molecular volume in the second quarter. As these retail partnerships continue to expand, we expect the mix through this channel to continue to grow throughout the remainder of the year. We continue to incur incremental costs to serve this channel. As COVID-19 positivity rates remain in the double digits, our ability to pull specimens for COVID-19 molecular testing continues to be limited. As a reminder, we are ramping investments to accelerate growth this year. We spent approximately $70 million in the first half of the year and we expect these investments to continue to ramp in Q3 to support the launch of our new consumer site later this year. A portion of these stand-up IT costs are temporary but variable marketing costs will increase following the launch of the new site. We'll also be adding additional headcount this year to support our consumer offering as well as bioinformatics capabilities within advanced diagnostics. I will now turn it back to Steve. Thanks, Steve. Quest is a special place and it has been an honor to serve as CFO for the last 9 years. Thanks to the analysts and investors on this call. I have enjoyed working with all of you. My family and I are excited for what lies ahead. Thanks, A.J., for the questions. Let me start with COVID. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, when you look at our COVID business, the good news was a lot more volume, a lot more revenue, a lot more dollars of operating margin. However, with that also goes less pooling, a larger mix shift towards the retail outlets which have higher expenses. And then we have had some slight erosion versus last year on average reimbursement a couple of dollars, not anything super significant. So the margin percentage was less but still, its contribution to the bottom line from COVID was much higher. As we look into the back half at this point, we don't know where the positivity rates are going to go but we've not assumed a material change in the amount of pooling. We would expect to continue with the current mix or potentially grow that as a proportion of our total COVID volumes. So within the ranges, that's kind of how we're seeing the balance of the year play out on COVID. So if the positivity rate drops down and the positive rate, I'm looking at Jim here, has been as high as we've seen through the pandemic, now a lot more people are doing rapid antigen testing and so on, we believe that the cases are underreported. But we believe that the prevalence of COVID right now is extremely high. And so in the earlier answer that we provided to Brian around the base business, there has been a historical negative correlation between those. And we do believe that the base business has absolutely been impacted by the surge in COVID. We just aren't sure how long it will last. On the base business, we've shared that as we built our plan and the ranges for 2022, we built in a higher SWB, salary work benefits assumption that was in our guidance. And certainly, that's something we control and that's really within expectations. We have a couple of billion dollars that we have long-term contracts. And so really not exposed to inflation in a short window for that. But then we have some other costs where we don't have long-term contracts and there are things that everybody is familiar with and you've heard from other companies as well, things like fuel, things like housekeeping, security, temporary labor. And so those areas have been a little more inflationary than we would have anticipated going into the year. The good news is those are in our results year-to-date during our guidance. We're not expecting that to go away immediately. We certainly hope it's not long-term inflation unlike where if you have wage inflation, you generally expect will continue. If you add contractual inflation with your key suppliers around reagents and other things that might be longer term as well or certainly a couple of years. We don't know how long this spike is going to last. But I can tell you, it's probably like $0.05 to $0.08 a quarter in the first half and we're not expecting that to change. We hope it might but in the guidance that we provided. So hopefully, that's helpful, A.J. And I just want to add one thing about peace in the back half. Steve talked about the potential for the PHE to not be extended which at this point, we're not assuming it does extend. But I want to remind people that the price drop is not a full margin drop because when we get to beyond the PHE, first off, there's not absolute certainty but most people would expect the positivity rate will be significantly lower. We can pool a lot more. So we can get some margin offset there dollar-wise. And then, the second one is that the retail relationships that we have will change in the structure. We know how that's going to work. And basically, the significant costs we're incurring right now to get that volume for the retail outlets will go away because it's only permitted under the PHE. It's complicated but it will go away. So while the value per requisition will drop to whatever price we end up with and people have talked about the CMS rate that was originally published and certainly, that's potential, over time, that's not all a margin hit because there's some other costs that go away. So we still will make a decent percentage margin, certainly fewer dollars per patient encounter. But I just want to make sure people are clear that COVID profitability doesn't fall completely off the cliff when the PHE goes away. Let me go otherwise, Jack, Thanks. Yes. So Jack, as you know, we don't provide specific margins on subsegments of our business. But what I can give you directionally is I referred to half of our volume coming from retail channels or nontraditional channels and we talked about dollar-wise, what the incremental cost per counter is there. A year ago, in the second quarter, it was about 1/3 of our volume. So you can see that's pretty significant. In the second quarter last year, we did quite a bit of pooling and that's varied in the interim quarters between that and now but there was quite a bit of pooling last year because the positivity rate had fallen -- very well. I think many of us by June of last year were thinking this might have been behind us before Delta hit us. And this quarter, we expected in our plans to do quite a bit of pooling but in reality, it was not a large amount. So that should give you a little bit of idea. The other thing I did mention a couple of dollars erosion on the average reimbursement. So I think you got all the pieces, not going to provide a specific number but that should help you understand. But I think the key thing is that the dollars we earned off COVID was much better than our plans. And that's -- and we expect it to continue and that's why we're rising guidance. So while the percentage was worse, the dollar bottom line was better. Yes. As Jim referenced, the vast majority of our increase has already taken place. Certainly, like all other companies, we have some off-cycle adjustments based on promotions and other things. But most of the \"inflationary headwinds\" in SWB were incurred in the second quarter. So if you look sequentially, that's one of the drivers of margin reduction first quarter to second quarter. That's been a historical event as well. That's not new. But we don't anticipate going forward to see significant inflation beyond kind of the run rate we were on in Q2. Yes. So Patrick, appreciate the question. We know where people's heads are at right now around the business and that's where ours are as well. So I can assure you we're spending a lot of time on that. We've spent a lot of time on that. There's a number of things that we generally control. And then there are some things that are a little bit less in our control. So we do our best to forecast those things. We put together ranges. And then we -- I think and believe we're very transparent with you about how those things play out. So you get a sense of, okay, well, what really is going on in the business? And because of that, I believe that, generally, we've not surprised people. And we've given you delivered on your expectations. We've given you timely updates. We've given you interim information. And based on my time with Sam and I think the team here, I would expect that to continue. So you would expect that with my departure that we're not going to change the way we talk to, the way we share, give all those updates. I think everybody appreciates what a great job Shawn does and know they can call them any time, any place and get him and he'll be as transparent as possible. So really, I think what it comes down to is, I believe we're focused on the right things. And also, I believe we do our best job of being as transparent as possible around all those key drivers. And so what I will add is that we really moved the needle on commercial. Over the last couple of years, we've talked about more pricing pressure in the client bill which is, as Steve referenced the hospital and then in some cases, where we contract directly with physicians. But instead of being a headwind on price, I will tell you that starting next year and going forward, I would expect that -- to be at least neutral, if not a tailwind. So we've moved it from a major headwind to be at least neutral and more likely positive. So wanted to dimensionalize a little more why you're hearing the positive comments for us. And it's in really recognition of what Steve said which is our strategic value to them. We're not a commoditized provider of a laboratory result. There's so much more to how we're helping them and then these value-based contracts that we referenced were based on performance, we can earn a better payment for ourselves. And so because of that, we really, really moved the environment and the relationships with the commercial payers. Well, thanks for all the questions, Pito. I'll start with 2023. We've not locked down our plan. And if we did, we generally don't give specific guidance until our fourth quarter earnings call. And I'll leave it to the management team. I'll be leaving exactly when they decide to do that but we're not going to comment any specifics around 2023. In terms of the amount of the increases, again, I'm not going to dimensionalize. We don't have a planned lockdown. But we have enough contracts that are already set for next year and enough progress on some that are either, as we referenced like Florida Blue or some others that are getting close to being locked down for renewal that I have confidence to say what I said which is, this is not going to be a next year for us on a price perspective... And yes, so I was going to continue that what you're hearing from us is what's happening now, Pito. And the $0.05 to $0.08 is more inflation than we would have anticipated. However, other things have changed as well. Most notably, we did a lot more COVID. So we delivered a lot more earnings. So just like we don't expect the high level of COVID and we could be wrong to expect and continue into 2023. Also, we'd be really disappointed if the inflation we're seeing in the noncontracted areas were to carry to 2023. But even if it does, we've got multiple pieces that are moving, including a better pricing environment in the commercial book. So in no way, shape or form, are we saying that when you put all these together, that, that $8.50 or in that range is not something we're still confident in. If I can just start quickly and then I'll pass it on to Jim. So Ricky, our source is not just seeing their medical loss ratios. But I'd point to two things in addition to what Jim talked about earlier which is our same-store sales as we call it. So one is we actually get data from the payers, okay, in total. So we know how many patient encounters they had for laboratory work. We know what our volume was and we can see that. The good news is we continue to gain share in those commercial books. However, we continue to see their total volume has been down, certainly in the second quarter. So it's payer data that's being provided by them to us that is the confidence to say, utilization has dipped in our space. The other one is I'd point to the  data which is based on billings of other independent labs. And if you look at that, that certainly suggests that utilization is down. So while you may be hearing its emergency room and inpatient, the data that we have and the best data we have also suggests that the market in which we operate is also depressed in the second quarter. So the only thing I would add is that, to Steve's point, when you ask our investments ramping down, I think there's two ways to think of investments. One is what's the P&L net impact and what is the level of spend. So we, at Investor Day, talked about growing our direct consumer business to $0.5 billion by 2025. That is still our intention. So as you can imagine, over the next several years, including 2023, we're expecting significant revenue growth. And in order to drive that revenue growth, we believe we need to spend more. However, the good news is that a lot of 2020 and 2021 was pre-revenue, pre-contribution margin. And as we go ahead, we would expect the net impact to actually be less and to be less of a headwind. So really, we're going to be investing less on the bottom line but spending more money to drive that accelerated growth. And then obviously, when we get to the scale and size that we're aspiring to, then we expect a healthy margin on that business. Sure. So let me take part of it, then I'm sure either Steve or Jim will jump in. So first of all, inflation really hasn't impacted the level of investment in a material way. And we're on track to spend about what we told you previously. As I referenced a minute ago, we haven't put our final plans together. But at this point, I would expect we're going to spend more next year. And we're going to spend more in marketing but we're going to spend a lot less and not much at all in the IT platform creation. So it's really going to be tied a very high variable cost and highly tied to revenue growth and we'll monitor, as Jim says and I'm sure Sam and Jim will be all over is to make sure we're making the progress and to make sure we don't get the spending ahead of ourselves. But if we do what we expect to do and we need to do to get to $0.5 billion by 2025, the spending will continue to go up. The only other dimension I want to mention here is because when we talk about investments in the base business, there's a little nuance here. Advanced diagnostics absolutely is the base business. But really this consumer business is new. So while a lot of the work we do is similar to what we've done historically in our base business, it's really a new business category or opportunity. And some of it may cannibalize what would have otherwise come through our traditional channels. But we do believe that a lot of it is actually incremental to the overall amount of volume that we perform. Jim or Steve, you want to... My apologies. Sure. So we're going to continue with what we've done. And what that is, is that between the dividend and we've already gotten there this year with the share repurchases to deliver a majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And with the $1.7 billion guidance and $400 million of capital, says at least $650 million between the dividend share repurchases and we already covered that. As we've also shared, we rather do M&A than share repurchases because we have some very rigorous financial parameters around the deals that we do. And so it's really going to be situational quarter-by-quarter. It may be different. Jim referenced that we have a deep pipeline and actually also commented that we have some negotiations that are well advanced. So I think we'd all be very disappointed if we didn't execute some deals before the end of the year. Don't know the exact timing of those. But certainly, as I said, I'd rather spend more on M&A and I know Steve would and you'll hear from Sam and Jim as they take over the reins, their view but I wouldn't expect it to materially change. So really no change to what we've done in the past. And at this point, no specific plans for cash deployment because we're really -- it's really dependent on that progression of the M&A."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Our base business performed well despite softer utilization trends which we believe impacted us and the rest of the health care industry. I'm proud of the efforts our team has made to grow our share of COVID-19 molecular testing since the end of the first quarter. We also ramped our investments to further accelerate growth in the areas of advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. In the quarter, we announced the selection of our next CFO, Sam Samad. Sam joins us from Illumina, where he served as Chief Financial Officer for 5-plus years. As many of you know, he brings a depth of health care experience that will help us in many ways. Prior to Illumina, Sam held several financial and operational leadership roles at Cardinal Health and Eli Lilly and Company. Sam, welcome to Quest Diagnostics. Thanks, Sam and I look forward to working very closely with you. Now, turning to our performance in the second quarter. Total revenues were $2.5 billion. Earnings per share were $1.96 on a reported basis and $2.36 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $402 million. COVID-19 testing revenues were approximately $355 million in the second quarter, down approximately 31% from 2021 and 41% from the previous quarter. In July, with the spread of the BA4 and BA5 variance, we continue to see the demand for COVID-19 molecular testing, consistent with the volumes we reported in June. Our positivity rate has increased since March and approximately 25% of the tests we performed in the first 2 weeks of July were positive. We believe that the COVID-19 trends since March contributed to the softness we observed in the broader health care utilization. As you've seen, we're successfully executing a strategy to increase our share of COVID-19 molecular testing. A key element of our strategy is to increase the number of testing access points through retail relationships. In addition to our CVS and Walmart relationships, we are now also collecting specimens at Rite Aid locations and the number of access points will continue to grow. Approximately half of our COVID-19 volume in the quarter came from retail channels. Quest is proud to have been selected by the CDC to participate in its increasing community access to testing, or ICATT program for COVID-19 testing. Through this program, qualified uninsured individuals can access COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing for zero out-of-pocket costs. In addition, we're pleased to be the provider of COVID-19 PCR testing for qualified insured and uninsured customers of Rite Aid nationwide for zero out-of-pocket expense. We now have approximately 6,000 COVID-19 patient access testing sites through retail relationships as well as our own patient service centers. Through these efforts, we estimate that we are performing approximately 8% of COVID-19 molecular testing in the U.S., up from approximately 4% in March. Finally, the public health emergency was extended into October which will help us maintain our current level of reimbursement. Based on these factors, we raised our COVID-19 revenue guidance for full year 2022 to between $1.15 billion and $1.30 billion. Now, turning to our base business. In the second quarter, we continued to make progress executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. Here are some highlights from the quarter. Our M&A funnel remains strong. We are in late-stage discussions with several hospital health systems on the purchase of their laboratory outreach business. This is in addition to our normal conversations we have with C-suite leaders on performing reference testing and providing professional lab services. While this pandemic paused some of these discussions, it has also created opportunities because of the financial and labor pressures that many hospital health systems are facing. We continue to accelerate growth through health plan access. Excluding COVID-19, health plan volumes and revenues grew faster than our overall base business in the quarter. Health plans continue to see the value of working with us. Over the last 2 years, we have renewed 12 national and large regional health plan contracts with price increases. We expect more renewals with price increases this year. And we're proud to be selected as one of the UnitedHealthcare's preferred lab network providers for the fourth consecutive year, providing physicians and patients with improved access, quality and value. Finally, we're pleased to share today that we have renewed our strategic relationship with Florida Blue. Florida continues to be an important large and growing state for us. Earlier this month, the CMS Transparency in Coverage Final Rules became effective to help consumers know the cost of a covered item or service before receiving care. Beginning July 1, 2022, group health plans and issuers of group or individual health insurance are required to post pricing information for covered items and services. We are leveraging that data to ensure patients and employers are aware of the value we offer. This trend will continue to gather momentum as more pricing transparency requirements will go into effect in the next 2 years. We believe that pricing transparency favors Quest Diagnostics which powers affordable care. We do this by offering clinical innovation, enabling better clinical outcomes through our quality, speed and accuracy of test results, improving the patient experience with accessible and easy-to-use patient resources and finally, reducing the cost of care. We continue to ramp our investments in advanced diagnostics capabilities. In the quarter, we saw growth from hematology, prenatal genetics and pharma services. We also introduced Quest AD Detect, a blood test to aid in the early assessment of Alzheimer's disease. We are seeing good early adoption from both primary care physicians and neurologists. Finally, last week, we launched the lab developed molecular test to aid in the detection of monkeypox. The test can differentiate monkeypox from other orthopox viruses and we will be able to perform nearly 30,000 tests a week by the end of July. In addition, we can expand testing to other laboratories in our network to further increase capacity if needed. We continue to see growth in direct-to-consumer testing, thanks to our COVID-19 offerings and more importantly, our base business testing. Within the base business testing category, we saw strong growth from testosterone, comprehensive metabolic panels and Lyme disease. We're excited about upcoming improved digital experience which we expect to debut later this year. We believe this improved experience will help us acquire, convert and retain more customers who visited QuestDirect digital platform. We expect to have much more to say about our improved digital experience before the end of this year. The second part of our two-point strategy is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and cost, thereby driving productivity gains. We have several initiatives underway to make this happen. Focused on attracting and retaining our people, optimizing our network, automating and digitizing our processes and getting paid for the work we do. Here are three examples. One, we're partnering with universities to help build our pipeline of expertise in medical technology, cytology and histology. We're also teaming up with a learning and development recruiting company to provide lobotomy certifications to prescreened candidates in exchange for a 2-year commitment to work at Quest. Two, our schedule at check-in initiative which encourages patients to make appointments has now expanded to 1,000 of our patient service sites. In one area which has implemented the program, we are seeing a 20% decrease in average wait times as well as an improvement in patient satisfaction. We're also building the payment process into the digital customer experience which frees up our phlebotomists to focus on specimen collection, thereby increasing their capacity and improving the patient-employee experience. Three, we continue to implement digital technology to provide end-to-end specimen tracking, including the arrival patterns that enable load leveling across the network which improves our productivity and provides greater transparency for our clients. We're not immune to the current inflationary environment and are managing through rising fuel and labor costs. Like many companies, higher-than-normal employee turnover in some job categories is impacting our ability to drive further productivity gains. However, these increased costs are in line with our expectations and are built into our guidance. We are expecting another year of solid Invigorate savings and productivity improvements to help offset these pressures. Finally, I'm very proud of our recently released 2021 corporate responsibility report and invite you all to download it. You can find it on our website. Among the highlights, in 2021, we launched our first formal materiality assessment to help identify the most significant ESG topics to the company and our stakeholders. Also, to enhance the level of our ESG disclosures, we began reporting in accordance with the SASB guidelines. We're very proud of the contributions Quest is making to empower better health and grateful to our 50,000 colleagues who are making that vision a reality every day. Now, Mark will provide more details on our performance and share more insights on our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022. Yes, Steve, what I would add is, look, we're in close touch with the payers. And the payers have indicated to us and you saw UnitedHealthcare's announcement earlier this week, that they saw softer utilization of health care services as well. In addition to that, we track a group of Quest accounts that we know are 100% loyal to us. We call it our same-store sales analysis. And we noticed in the quarter that it was basically flat, those accounts that are 100% loyal. So, the other thing we look at is just the mix business. And we noticed our general health and wellness panels grew at a lower rate than some of our infectious disease, non-COVID infectious disease and chronic care types of testing that we do. So we -- based on all that information, we come to the conclusion that the base was certainly softer this quarter. Yes. So A.J., as we've talked in the past, there's still certainly a lot of opportunity around automation of manual processes in the laboratory. I touched on in my comments around some of the automated check-in procedures. So we've long had appointment scheduling. What we've added recently is when a patient walks into the PSC without an appointment, you actually go to the check in and you -- and if the wait room is full, you schedule an appointment at that point. And what we've seen is it really does help productivity in the PSC, as well as if the patient leaves, they may not come back to Quest. If they make an appointment to come back in 2 hours or the next day, we feel like the patient retention is better. But automation, the use of artificial intelligence in terms of readouts of manual curves and laboratories, all of that work continues. And then I'd tell you, the other thing that will help continue to drive productivity is our work around retention of our employees. So our productivity, like all companies, we're seeing a much higher increase in turnover. We feel like it is stabilized, albeit at a higher point. So as we now drive retention higher and turnover lower that will certainly help our productivity efforts in the back half of the year. No, it hasn't changed at all, Jack. We said 3% to 4% for the year. We're still within that guidance. We've already provided the merit increase for the year. We do that annually in the April time frame. So it's already in the Q2 numbers for sure. Ricky, the last thing I'd say is we're not immune to hospital. The inpatient work -- remember, we get $1 billion a year in reference work. We have another $0.5 billion in PLS. So when inpatient and outpatient procedures are down, that certainly does affect our business on the health system, hospital side. On the physician office side, again, we closely look at a set of accounts spread across the country that we know are 100% loyal to Quest and we measure that we call it same-store sales. Again, our general health and wellness panels from a mix standpoint, were certainly lower than some of our chronic disease panels in the quarter. And then the last thing, geographic mix. We've talked and it hasn't changed dramatically that our book of business in New York City is down still low to mid-double digits. On the other hand, we see incredibly strong growth in the southern part of the country, in the southeast portion as well as the southwest and parts of the West. So if there's been a population migration out of New York City into the southeast, then we're certainly seeing some of that in our business. Yes. So in terms of 2023, as Mark said, there's a lot of moving parts at this point. We're committed to investments in advanced diagnostics. We're committed to investments in our consumer direct consumer initiated testing business. Obviously, we can modulate those things if we see inflation getting worse. But at this point, we can't give you any further guidance than what we've given you around those. We're committed to advanced diagnostics, we're committed to our clinical -- our consumer direct -- consumer-initiated testing business. In terms... Yes. You asked about PAMA. And we've said that it's in our 2023 guidance outlook that we provided at this point and we've said it's about a $90 million headwind. And just to clarify, the target that we outlined at the Investor Day for the direct-to-consumer business was $250 million by 2025. Yes. So at this point, it's hard to anticipate what the market opportunity has been or will be. I can tell you, our testing volumes at this point are modest. If we've done 500, 600 tests that would be on the high side. However, it is growing. And we do see growth. We've only had the test up and running for 2 weeks. And over that 2-week period, it's grown day by day. Right now, we're not yet approved for New York state. We expect that to happen within the next week or 2. I'm sure you're reading that, that is where the major outbreak is in New York City. So we would expect to participate in that market. But most of our volume at this point is coming actually off of the West Coast. And so we'll keep you updated on what we're seeing."

Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. 01:08 The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, health care insurer, governments and clients payer reimbursement rates for COVID-19 molecular tests, the pandemic's impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy, and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts, which are drivers beyond the company's knowledge and control. 01:40 For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business, excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth, are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. 02:14 Now, here is Steve Rusckowski.\nSteve Rusckowski: 02:18 Thanks, Shawn and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we\u2019re off to a good start in 2022. We drove a strong year-over-year growth in our base business, which excludes COVID-19 testing. COVID-19 volumes remain strong early in the quarter and decreased in February and March, in line with the market. 02:42 We continue to make investments to further accelerate growth in the base business, and our efforts to improve productivity are helping us to offset inflationary pressures. So, based on the strength of our business we\u2019re raising our 2022 guidance. This morning, I\u2019ll discuss our performance for the first quarter of 2022 and then Mark will provide more detail on the financial results and talk about our updated financial outlook for 2022. 03:12 But first, I like to ask Jim Davis to give us an update on our leadership transition. Jim?\nJim Davis: 03:19 Yeah, thank you Steve. We are making very good progress on the transition. Yesterday, we announced a series of organizational changes and leadership appointments of seasoned executive designed to help us accelerated growth and drive operational excellence. First category is a Senior Vice President of the regional businesses. Kathy has deep knowledge of our business gained through three decades of leadership at Quest. She will oversee the regional and enterprise operations, the commercial organization and marketing. She will also be responsible for driving operational excellence, including   for company's quality and productivity initiatives. 04:01 Next, Carrie Eglinton Manner is taking on an expanded role as Senior Vice President, , Advanced and General Diagnostics Clinical Solutions. For more than five years, Carrie has been responsible for bringing innovative solutions to the market through Quest clinical franchises. Before joining Quest, Carrie had nearly two decades of leadership experience in healthcare and medical technologies. 04:25 Patrick Plewman, who has led our West region and has been with Quest Diagnostics for more than nine years is named Senior Vice President, Diagnostics Services, which is a portfolio of data driven analytics and services businesses, which enabled employers, providers, pharma companies, and others to deliver healthcare more effectively and efficiently. This portfolio includes employer population health, employer solutions, ExamOne, Healthcare Analytics Solutions, and Quest HealthConnect. And before joining Quest, Patrick had over 20 years of leadership experience in the biotech and molecular diagnostics industries. 05:09 Mark Delaney has joined Quest as Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Mark has responsibility for the commercial team, including sales and sales operations. Previously, he helped senior sales and marketing leadership roles over his 30 year career at GE Healthcare and Hillrom. 05:29 And finally, Richard Adams has joined Quest as Vice President and General Manager of our Consumer Initiated Testing Business, a new role. Richard has two decades of varied leadership experience in e-commerce, digital marketing, and customer experience, and will lead our rapidly growing direct-to-consumer testing business. These appointments demonstrate the investment strength of our management team and we're really excited about the leadership and expertise that both Mark and Richard Adams will bring to us. 06:00 Additionally, we're making very good progress on our CFO selection process and are on track to name a leader in the next several months. The management transition is going very well and the changes we've announced yesterday are an important step in positioning us for the future. 06:16 Steve, I'll now turn it back to you.\nSteve Rusckowski: 06:18 Thanks, gentlemen. I agree the transition is going well. Now, turning to our results, our base business continued its strong recovery up more than 6% from the prior year. Total revenues were $2.6 billion; earnings per share was $2.92 on a reported basis, and $3.22 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $480 million. 06:50 COVID-19 testing revenues were approximately $600 million in the first quarter and that\u2019s down approximately 28% from 2021. Nearly 60% of the COVID-19 revenues came from the Omicron peak in January. We project  demand for PCR testing through the end of the year and into 2023, albeit at lower levels. 07:16 The public health emergency was extended into July, maintaining our current level of reimbursement. And based on these factors, we raised our COVID-19 revenue guidance for the full-year of 2022 to between $850 million to $1 billion. 07:36 Turning to our base business, in the first quarter, we continue to make progress executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. So, here are some highlights from the quarter. We continue to make in-roads with our health plans, gaining share and increasing revenues faster than the market. 07:58 Our health plan revenues without COVID-19 grew faster that our overall base business did in the quarter. We also deepened relationships with payers through value based contracting. We currently had about 30% of our health plan revenues are tied to value based elements. And these included patient health outcomes, quality or shared savings. 08:23 We think we could grow this about 50% over the next few years. And we believe these value based contracts are achieving better alignment with health plans, which we believe will allow us to gain shares. 08:37 We're also working with our hospital health system leaders to help them execute their last strategy. A lot of partnerships of Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, Memorial Hermann in Texas, and those which really helped that work in  are performing well. 08:58 Hospitals look to us for their help with through laboratory design, staffing and management and we can enable them to monetize outreach lab assets that help them free-up needed capital. We have continued to make important investments to strengthen our advanced diagnostics capabilities and are already seeing results. 09:21 We continue to make investments to accelerate growth in oncology, hematology, hereditary genetics, genomic sequencing services, and power services. Since we\u2019ve ramped up our investments, and our advanced diagnostics portfolio, we have already accelerated growth by several 100 basis points and expect to deliver the 8% growth earlier than 2024, which we committed to at our 2021 Investor Day. 09:54 We remain excited about the opportunities we see in the direct-to-consumer testing market. As you know, we're ramping up investments in our consumer business and it\u2019s having an impact. 10:06 In the quarter, our direct-to-consumer revenues more of than doubled compared to the prior year, driven by strong growth in both our COVID-19 testing operations as well as our base business testing. We\u2019re seeing continuous solid demand for  comprehensive metabolic panels and complete blood counts. Also our new and approved digital experience is on track to launch later this year. 10:33 Finally, we've been expanding our diagnostics services portfolio. We are collaborating with a small digital  software firm to deliver diabetic retinal imaging services through designated Quest Diagnostic patient service centers across the United States. This will aid in the screening of patients as part of the diabetes management program. 10:58 The second part of our strategies is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and costs thereby driving productivity gains. We are not immune to the current inflationary environment, but we're tightly managing our operations and are expecting another good year of the bigger rate savings and productivity improvements to help offset these pressures. 11:26 So, by way of our example, our procurement team continues to work with our strategic suppliers to mitigate potential price increases and improved productivities through our long-term relationships. Also today, the team has effectively managed challenges in our global supply chain. 11:46 We also look to our suppliers to deliver innovation to help us a lower overall cost of testing and improved quality. The most recent example is the rollout of our new   that is being deployed across our laboratory network. 12:04 Our new lab in Clifton, New Jersey has been operational for about a year and we are seeing incremental productivity gains from the investment we\u2019ve made in automation and artificial intelligence. 12:16 Our new   initiative encourages patients to make appointments allowing us to better manage demand and  productivity while enhancing the patient experience. The system has been successfully deployed to over 700 patient service centers. Our continued invested in operations is producing results. And we are well on our way to achieving our targeted productivity gains of 3% of our cost structure in 2022. 12:50 Now, Mark will provide more details on our performance and share more insights and our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022. Mark?\nMark Guinan: 12:59 Thanks, Steve. In first quarter, consolidated revenues were 2.61 billion, down 4% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 6.3% to more than 2 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 27.6% to approximately 600 million. Revenues for Diagnostic information services declined 3.9% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. 13:39 Total volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 1.3% versus the prior year and was roughly flat under an organic basis. Total base testing volumes increased more than 6% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew nearly 5%. We experienced some modest softening of base testing volumes in January during the peak of the Omicron surge. The volume has rebounded in February and March. 14:11 COVID-19 testing volumes surged during the spread of Omicron variant during the winter and volumes peaked in January, but declined through the month of February and into March. Together with our JV partners in our Quest, we resulted approximately 7.2 million molecular tests. 14:30 Quest  resulted roughly 6.3 million molecular test, down approximately 2 million tests and 1 million tests versus the prior year in fourth quarter respectively. We also resulted nearly 450,000 serology tests in the first quarter. Our COVID-19 molecular volumes have generally stabilized and the average of roughly 30,000 tests per day over the last four weeks, excluding similar request. 14:59 Revenue per acquisition declined 5.2% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rep was up modestly. Importantly, we continue to see an improving price environment. Unit price reimbursement pressure was less than 100 basis points in the quarter. 15:21 Reported operating income in the first quarter was 513 million or 19.7% of revenues compared to 660 million or 24.3% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was 554 million or 21.2% of revenues, compared to 708 million or 26% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income was primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volumes, a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from non-traditional channels, which carry additional expenses or logistics costs, investments to accelerate growth in our base business and lower average reimbursements for COVID-19 molecular tests. These   were partially offset by strong growth in our base business. 16:16 As many of you have heard, the health resources and services administration or HRSA, stopped accepting claims to pass and treat uninsured patients on March 22, due to insufficient funding.  runs the program to provide funding for COVID-19 testing vaccination and treatment for uninsured patients. Approximately 14% of our COVID-19 molecular testing volume has come from uninsured patients, which is much higher than the 1% to 2% we typically see in our base business. 16:50 As a result, we were unable to build HRSA to over 20 million in COVID-19 testing work that was performed just prior to the March 23 HRSA cut-off date. Moving forward, we are now dealing uninsured patients for COVID-19 testing directly upfront. As a result, we've seen a decline in our uninsured COVID-19 molecular testing volumes in late March and into April, and this is reflected in trends I shared earlier. 17:19 Reported EPS was $2.92 in the quarter, compared to $3.46 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.22, compared to $3.76 last year. Cash provided by operations was $480 million in Q1 versus $731 million in the prior year period. And we repurchased 350 million of stock during the first quarter. 17:47 Now, turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between 9.2 billion and 9.5 billion, a decline of approximately 12% to 15% versus the prior year. Base business revenues are expected to be between 8.35 billion and 8.5 billion, an increase of approximately 4% to 6%. 18:10 COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between 850 million and 1 billion, a decline of approximately 64% to 69%. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.88 and $8.38, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9 and $9.50. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least 1.6 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 400 million. 18:43 Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated 2022 guidance, as well as some additional considerations. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average approximately 10,000 to 20,000 tests per day for the rest of the year. This reflects modest continued declines in Q2 from the roughly 30,000 tests per day we are seeing in April. And some degree of stabilization during the second half of the year. 19:12 As we look toward 2023, our expectation for COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes assumes that the COVID-19 testing run rates in the second half of 2022 continues into next year. 19:27 Last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through mid-July. We assume average reimbursements of COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period, while the public health emergency  renewed beyond July, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance. 19:47 We remain prepared for additional future surges collecting COVID-19 testing volume from a range of customers. While the PHE is in effect, we continue to incur incremental costs from non-traditional channels for supplies, special logistics  and channel expenses for this volume, which can represent roughly $30 in incremental cost per test. Therefore, you should not assume the higher reimbursement due to the PHE extension drops right to the bottom line. 20:16 As Steve noted earlier, we're already seeing some returns in our investments to accelerate growth, particularly in the areas of advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. And would expect a margin tailwind on these investments in 2023. 20:33 As a reminder, we are planning to spend approximately 160 million on these investments this year. We spent approximately 30 million in the first quarter and are looking for these investments to ramp up in Q2 to support the launch of our new consumer site later this year. A portion of these stand-up IP costs are temporary, but variable marketing costs will increase   launch of the new site. 20:58 We\u2019ll also be adding additional headcount this year to support our consumer offering, as well as bioinformatics capabilities within advanced diagnostics. 21:08 Finally, we know there's a lot focus on expectations for 2023. While it\u2019s clearly too early to provide specific guidance for next year based on everything we know and see today, we expect to deliver topline and earnings consistent with our long-term outlook that we provided at our 2021 Investor Day. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Steve.\nSteve Rusckowski: 21:30 Thanks Mark. Well to summarize, we're off to a good start in 2022 driving strong year-over-year growth in the base business. We continue to make important investments to accelerate growth and we are seeing the results. Now based on the strength of our base business, we've raised our outlook for the remainder of the year. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: 21:54 Thank you.  Our first question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser: 22:12 Good morning. So, a really nice job in the quarter managing cost and improving margins. So, how has the performance in Q1 compared to your expectations? And how should we think about the margin expansion opportunity for the rest of the year from 1Q level? If we look at that as a baseline?\nMark Guinan: 22:33 Yes. Ricky thanks for the question. As you look at the way the quarter played out, Omicron was more severe than we had anticipated, which drove higher COVID revenues, but we also saw the base business impacted by that. So, definitely in January as we mentioned the base business was softer, so relative to our expectations in Q1 more COVID, less base business, but as we exited the quarter and certainly as we talked about in February and March the base business bounced back to our expectations. 23:08 So, while we're very pleased with where we see the base business, growth for the year, it would have been even higher had it not been for Omicron. And the margin is really were what we were expecting. So, we walked through in the last call how some of the margin impacts in Q4 was really temporary around annual incentive plan and some costs related to some special things that we needed to do for COVID testing in that quarter, some over time that we're having in fair amount of  and some things that we really saw as temporary. 23:44 Look  is that once we got the Omicron, those costs, generally did go away and we anticipate further reduction in some of the special expenses related to COVID safety and protection for employees that we continue to advance hopefully and get into the endemic and end of the pandemic. So, I'd say other than the higher COVID revenue and a little lower base in January, generally the  is expected, and that's why we're comfortable raising the bottom and upper end of our guidance at the midpoint.\nSteve Rusckowski: 24:15 Just like to reiterate what Mark said about the base business, just underscore that we're pleased with what we saw in Q1. It would have been better, if it didn't have the softness that Mark talked about in January. We remind everyone that we posted about 6.3% growth in our base business, which had only about 100-days\u2019 worth of acquisitions. 24:38 So the organic growth was around five. And again, if January was stronger, it would have been stronger than that. So, we feel good about that to be the start of the year, which gives us confidence for the full-year. So feel bit about the start of the year for our base business. And that gave us the confidence to raise guidance for the full-year beyond COVID.\nMark Guinan: 24:56 One additional comment on that. When you look at the compares, the easiest compare on the basis was Q1. So, to Steve's point, we've credited that even better. We would have done it better than the 6.3 of January not been impacted by Omicron, but as we go through the balance of the year, it compares to get a little tougher because lot the recovery from other pandemic, occurred late in 2020 and early in 2021. So, the growth going forward is more going to be driven by share and less about utilization and the market recovery.\nRicky Goldwasser: 25:35 So, can I just quickly follow-up on that? You talked about the improvement in   with more difficult comps. So, how is demand shaping up in April to date?\nMark Guinan: 25:47 Yes. So, the business continues to perform at a high level as it was happening in Q1. So, it wouldn't be updated in our guidance if we weren't confident that what we saw in terms of the performance early is continued. So, we\u2019re more focused on overall growth as opposed to the percentage year-over-year because obviously the compare makes it complicated. So, we're very happy as we get into April and we see the performance of our base business. And as we mentioned, COVID is kind of stabilized. We're not sure how long that will continue. We certainly took a little bit of a volume hit from the change in HRSA. 26:25 And because there's been a little bit of a spike I'd say some of that was partially offset by the market growing a little bit recently. So that's probably the way you get to a reasonably flat level of COVID testing over the last month.\nRicky Goldwasser: 26:44 Thank you.\nOperator: 26:47 Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: 26:51 Good morning, Patrick.\nPatrick Donnelly: 26:53 Hey, good morning. Thank you guys for taking the questions. Maybe just another one on the margins. You touched on a little bit there in the first question. Can you just talk about, I guess given the ongoing growth investments, wage inflation, can you just talk about, kind of your thoughts as we work our way through this year and into 2023. Obviously, the PHE extension should help on that front in terms of kind of the margin side. So, again, I guess, when we look at the earnings raise, how should we think about the base margin piece again ex-ASP as we work our way through this year and again into 2023?\nSteve Rusckowski: 27:24 Yeah. So, as Mark indicated in his prepared remarks, changing dynamics that are business with investments in the second quarter and then less COVID in the back half of the year and what we indicated we will be coming out of the year in the back half with \u2013 the amount of COVID testing we would expect, there's a good level to think about in 2023. 27:49 And so what we also expect is to continue to get the investment returns that we expect in advanced diagnostics and in consumer testing, starting in the back half, and again, what Mark said in his prepared remarks, and we believe that investment return will be a tailwind for us in 2023. So, this is a transitional year with those investments. Transitional year for COVID, and Mark you like to give a little perspective on Q2 and then the back half?\nMark Guinan: 28:22 Yes. And I\u2019ll try to answer your questions Patrick. So, on inflation, we talked about building in an extra 100 basis points or so in our wages costs. And that was in our original guidance. And through 3.5 months of the year we haven't seen anything that suggests that wasn't a reasonable assumption. So, basically, inflation was about where we\u2019re expecting. And I'd say, our non-wage items, such as materials and supplies and so on, surely fuel costs have been bouncing around, but nothing has deviated significantly from our critical assumptions coming into the year around inflation. 29:03 The PHE is significant revenue and from a dollar margin perspective, it certainly is helpful, but from a percentage margin and perspective, I want to be clear that it's not significantly higher than the post PHE world because those costs go away that reference, that are more than $30. So, the people are focused on percentage margins, the base is not a big change in terms of what you will see. 29:03 And I guess the important thing is that as the base volume grows, we've always shared that incremental organic growth in the base business as a very high level of drop through. So, the other margin consideration as we grow as we expected and as we've signaled in our guidance, that that will help drive margin expansion. And then finally, just a reminder that we are in a much better place in price than we've been historically. And so, therefore, a lot of the  productivity savings that in the past help pay for inflation,  inflation is a little bit worse. Certainly the pricing environment is better. So, there's more of that to cover that inflation and also to drive bottom line margin expansion.\nSteve Rusckowski: 30:16 So remember too as you think about, as we transition for the year, and Ricky asked about April. We have higher level testing in April going on. We do periodically update you on that. And that number we expect in our guidance to come down. And as we indicated as we come out of 2022, we'll be running around 10,000 to 15,000 tests per day. And we're assuming that the PHE will expire because we didn\u2019t know nothing beyond what we've heard so far, which will add sometime in July. 30:51 So, as you think about that transition, and then think about the investments we're making and thinking about the nice momentum we're building in the base business it gives you some perspective of how we're going to come through the three remaining quarters of this year, and then guide us to a reasonable place to be able to deliver what Mark indicated for 2023.\nPatrick Donnelly: 31:15 Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the balance sheet, cash flow obviously has been pretty strong for the past few quarters here, capital allocation is in focus for investors, can you just talk about your priorities there? What the M&A pipeline looks like, what the funnel looks like? And then maybe compare that to kind of the share repo opportunities?\nMark Guinan : 31:35 Sure. So, our capital priorities haven't changed. We have that commitment return majority of free cash flow as we shared, you know normal times we get pretty close with the dividend and we do some share repurchases to offset dilution, obviously with the COVID  cash generation, and we've had the inability to deploy more cash. We always preferred to do M&A because we've got very high standards around the deals that we executed. So, would always be the preference, but at given point in time, given our strong cash from the balance sheet and our ability to generate cash, we're not going to sit on it. 32:13 So, the 350 million in the first quarter is more of a reflection of how much cash we had at year-end and the fact that we didn\u2019t do a transaction in Q1 as opposed any change in priority. So, Steve, would you want to comment on the pipeline?\nSteve Rusckowski: 32:29 Yes. Yes. So, we feel good about again, our commitment of 2% growth through acquisitions. As you know, we've delivered that consistently. We feel good about our ability to \u2013 on a routine basis to deliver the consolidation strategy we've been executing against. We've got a few step we are working on and we still feel that we will be able to get to a number close to that 2% in 2022. So, as I have said in the first quarter, we're lighter than that. This is lumpy, but we do expect that we'll be moving on a few in the second quarter and into the third quarter to deliver what we expect.\nPatrick Donnelly: 33:09 Great. Thank you.\nShawn Bevec: 33:10 Operator, next question.\nOperator: 33:11 Our next question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: 33:16 Good morning, A.J.\nA.J. Rice: 33:19 Hi, everybody. Obviously, the value based arrangements are becoming more significant as you described in your prepared remarks. I wondered if we could get you to step back and talk about a few of the key features of these arrangements and discuss how they allow Quest to do better economically? It sounds like you think you can do better economically under these types of arrangements. And I know you referred to pricing being better. We used to always think a managed care pricing is being a 1% to 2% negative headwind each year, has that dynamic changed and is it mainly because of these value based arrangements?\nSteve Rusckowski: 33:56 Yes. So, let me start and then I'll ask Mark and Jim to kind of add to this. As we have said in our strategy here and health plan access change there is a big opportunity for us, number one. Number two is, we do plan that gaining share. And number three, we are gaining shares. So, our health plan revenues are growing faster than overall revenues and we believe growing faster in the markets. So, we're making progress. So, in that regard, the second question is the environment has gotten better. 34:29 We've indicated in prior calls and prior quarters, and it's proven to be true as we go throughout this year. As we get into renegotiations with the plans, we believe we have stronger position to negotiate and in some cases, modest prices because we're delivering more and more value. Our quality is improving, service performance is better, and we have an opportunity to help them narrow the network and narrow the number of providers they have with the number of these programs. 34:59 So, it has gotten better and we indicated that less than 100 basis points overall. I'll remind you that when we talk about price, there's a lot of focus around the plans, but we have price pressures in the hospital business and our client build business, but at least on the health plan side, it has gotten better and we have gotten modest increases for some of the contract renewals that we've had. 35:21 In terms of value-based contracting, the biggest opportunity we have, which you indicated in the past is around United. And United is a very different relationship for us and what we had years ago. It is clearly a relationship that we're working different aspects to be able to pick up share. And as part of that, now it's indicated in my remarks, we do have shared savings opportunities and we have opportunities together to do a better job with their membership than their clients. And then beyond United, we have extended that thinking to other parts of our health plant portfolio with other concepts, they\u2019re not all identical. But they have similar characteristics in general where we have better alignment between what they're trying to accomplish and what we're trying to accomplish. 36:13 In the end, we\u2019re all trying to achieve what's been described as the  , which is better quality, better experience, at lower cost, and that's resonating very well in the marketplace. Overall, as you know, this is an entirely focused organizations on that  plan for the greater delivery systems as well. So, Mark you like to add something to\u2026\nJim Davis: 36:37 Yes. So, A.J., personally we think about value based care and arrangements. This is not necessarily being . So, this is being indicated with both United Healthcare  many of these value based care incentives come to us through performance on leakage agreements where they provide us list of physicians that are using how to connect for   and what we move that for, there's a value base, there's an incentive for Quest. 37:07 We proactively work with both payers on moving work out of extensive health system laboratories. If selective  list of physicians that are using that those labs and we go after it. Finally, we worked hand in hand with both of those plans and others on approaching employers and getting employers to see the benefits of steering their employees to the independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. 37:34 When we do enter into these capitated arrangements, I can assure you going forward, we're going to have a much greater stake in what we call the clinical pathways that are used by physicians to ensure that utilization makes sense for the clinical condition that the physician diagnosed.\nMark Guinan: 37:55 Yeah. The only thing I'll add, A.J. is, there\u2019s elements in those contracts, that Jim just described. The one I'll add is also  we've talked about in the past, when we do an acquisition of hospital outreach, and instead of the rates immediately dropping to our rates, there's a step down a majority of our large contracts right now. So, we kind to share the value of movement network through an acquisitions, which aligned our incentives and really the greatest value is, is it moves the conversation around away from price being the way they create value and more towards  which Jim talked about and partnering and working together to get connections of work to  better price, but also there's things that come with it that benefit the patients, the physicians, it's our tools and our technology, it's our quality. 38:50 I mean, you know that in the  , it's not about the price, it's really about a couple of the metrics around quality and tools and I mean what is their experience in the patient drop center to how we feed the data to the payer and the frequency in quality. So, there\u2019s a lot beyond price that determines  space and that's where we've been successful in moving the conversation. 39:16 And yes, then within the contracts themselves, there will be shared savings and these other value driven parameters that can get us a better price or more value as we demonstrate to them where we\u2019re creating value for them as well.\nA.J. Rice: 39:31 Alright, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: 39:34 Our question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: 39:39 Good morning, Pito.\nPito Chickering: 39:40 Very good morning, guys.   my questions. Back to the guidance question, previously, it didn't assume any share repo besides offsetting dilution, what does your current guidance assume? Back into net income guidance, you know from the previous guidance using 124 million diluted shares in fourth quarter, versus the current guidance at 121 million shares backing into the midpoint range and net income, essentially flat despite revenues up $200 million or at the low-end. So, it\u2019s got us into a margin compression of about 10 basis points. So, a long way of saying, is margin guidance down today versus previous guidance and any ?\nMark Guinan: 40:21 Yes. At this point, the share repurchases is definitely done pretty much offset our equity programs. So, it's not there's a huge decline in waste so based on what we've done. And in terms of going forward, it'd be dependent on M&A opportunities versus buybacks. So, there's no material change in our way so contemplated in our guidance so it is to what we gave back to .\nSteve Rusckowski: 40:52 And as you see in our results,   Q1 with about $700 million worth of cash. And obviously, we're going to put that to use to a good way. We're looking at acquisitions as we talked about. And we'll handle that in due course throughout the remainder of the year.\nPito Chickering: 41:17 I think just as you drill into that, you know backing into previous guidance as your current guidance with the share counts you had before versus current share counts, I get to net income of about $1.1 billion for both the current Quest, the current guidance versus previous guidance, despite revenues going up, is that the right math? Does that would imply margin impression about 10 basis points?\nMark Guinan: 41:38 Yes. So, I would not want to take away an implication of margin compression Pito. And remember that we don't do point estimates. We do ranges. So, there's a lot of moving parts, everything from topline mix, clinical mix, exactly, precisely, how much COVID testing we get going forward. And share obviously deployment of cash. 42:04 So that's why we give a range. So, we feel very good about the margins. We would expect that the margins would improve on the base business going forward. Certainly, the COVID elements and everything from the PHE to the volume we have could impact margins as well. 42:21 I\u2019ll give you one example if you're looking at income margin, certainly some of the JVs where specifically some of our Quest where they have done a lot of COVID testing, we have no revenue, but we get their earnings contribution from that. So, there's a lot of things that they kind of skew margins, but I think what people really want to understand is the base business. 42:41 So, what\u2019s going to happen going into 2023? We're very comfortable with the base business, we\u2019ll be at or above pre-pandemic levels and we'll have a larger base business in 2023 with some level of COVID testing and in the margin performance that you saw in Q1, we're not expecting it to erode, even despite the factor, we did talk about raising up some of our CIT investments in Q2. So, it's also been contemplated, it\u2019s all in that range of guidance and so it\u2019s kind of hard to pin down specific margin at this point, but it's not bad news.\nPito Chickering: 43:16 Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: 43:19 Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: 43:25 Good morning, Kevin.\nKevin Caliendo: 43:28 Good morning. Want to follow-up on the guidance question just a little bit, so you'd beat in the quarter by roughly $0.25 and you raised your COVID revenues by 150 or so, which depending on what margin you use could almost equate to that same sort of $0.25, was the guidance range, was the guidance range raise related to the first quarter beat? Was it related to the COVID increases there an overlap there? How should we think about that?\nMark Guinan: 43:58 So, the guidance range was related to the totality of the business. And again, if you look at Q1 as we shared, the base business was  extremely well. Didn\u2019t do as well as we expected when we entered the year because of Omicron. 44:15 So, some of the raise in COVID for the year and the performance in Q1 was really offsetting a slightly softer base business. Now, the good news is that the base business came back. So that softness in the base business was temporary. The other dynamic is that, we do have the PHE being extended and we also have this change in HRSA, which is not insignificant. So, we mentioned there was over $20 million of loss opportunity that will get paid for the uninsured from more than we did in late March. 44:49 So, there's a lot of moving pieces here, and so it's really hard to parse precisely what is driving the rate, it's really our greater confidence in the business performance for the year in totality with all of those pieces. And so again, well a lot people focus as they rightly understood on the midpoint, I'd say just in general business is in better shape and in total than we would have expected 90 days ago and that's why we're comfortable raising both the topline in the bottom line.\nSteve Rusckowski: 45:20 Yes. As we enter the year, what we indicated for COVID is around 700 to 1 billion and obviously we're delivering 600 million in the first quarter. We have more certainty around what is left within that initial guidance. 45:37 Obviously going into the year, there's a lot of uncertainty of what would happen now,  how fast would decline, and how each testing would go on in the back half of the first quarter. So, the timing up of the range, the asset range is hit by this, as Mark indicated there\u2019s puts and takes of this in terms of the impact on our bottom line. But I'll just reiterate, we feel good about our start with our based business and we're tracking well for a strong year based on our initial guidance.\nKevin Caliendo: 46:11 Okay. Just a quick follow-up on the 160 million in investments. You said part of it would be temporary, part of it would be permanent. I think one of the things we're all trying to figure out here is, sort of what the base margins look like in a non-COVID or a COVID would  flat year-over-year or whatever, which seems like we're moving into, what the base margins normalize would look like? So, if we think about how much might linger, any help on that? And maybe the question would be, what do you think base margins look like in 2023 or exiting when COVID becomes endemic versus where they were in 2019? Like, is it possible that those base margins are higher going forward? That you guys have figured out a way to be more productive ?\nSteve Rusckowski: 47:02 Remember, we're vesting $160 million, we\u2019re vesting   sixty million because we have a strong business piece to get the returns. So, what we had indicated, we are ahead of our plan to get the returns in advanced diagnostics and we feel bullish about the opportunities of the consumer. And the results on both of those fronts have been good news. And so, when we talk about the second part that you mentioned of putting in place a new platform, also where a consumer business we're investing in some marketing to get the growth we expect, and we are getting the results so far and we'll continue to see the results in the back half of the year. 47:43 What we also said is that as we come out of 2022 into 2023, when you think about a year-on-year compare, with the returns we expect from Advanced Diagnostics and the returns we expect from the consumer, that a year-on-year improvement in those businesses will be tailwinds for our margins in 2023. 48:10 So, again, we're investing to grow, we're investing to get a return. We feel good about getting those returns actually quicker than expected, and next year, the year-on-year compare related to that 160 million will be a net tailwind for us in terms of our earnings in 2023. Mark anything you like to add?\nMark Guinan: 48:31 Yes. So, just a reminder that we shared a view that we could  business to   by 2025. And remember, especially if you strip out the COVID testing revenue this was a business that was small millions, not that long ago. So, very significant growth projected in this business and we\u2019re still very comfortable and confident. We just talked about the performance in this past quarter and we don't have our new customer experience IT capability that we think is really going to make a difference in terms of the ease and use of that site. 49:09 So, as Steve said, we\u2019ll create tailwinds because we'll be investing less relative to the revenue. But in terms of the margin, what I'd say is, on the business ex-consumer, the margins will be as good or better than you're used to talking about pre-pandemic. But we will have a sizable consumer business that is still an investment mode because we're still looking to grow. So, the overall enterprise margin you should not expect to be expanded. The good news is, we would expect stronger growth. 49:44 And as for some reason that consumer business doesn't deliver and we can turn off the marketing expense. So, it's not as if we\u2019re adding tons of people or infrastructure or costs. So, we\u2019re very confident in our ability to grow that business. We want to invest to optimize that growth for a period of time, it is going to improve its bottom line next year relative to this year and then certainly over the years beyond that, we would expect to have a nice healthy margin on that business as well. And it will be quite sizeable.\nSteve Rusckowski: 50:15 And as Mark said, as we go through thinking by the way, we indicated in our Investor Day, and we're not going to give you 2023 guidance, so Mark indicated is when we think about 2023, we're still believing we're comfortably in the range we would expect in 2023 in terms of EPS in growth. And the second half sets its up nicely and what we've implied in our guidance for the full-year implies a set-up, so we would be able to deliver what Mark indicated in 2023 and a view that we indicated in our Investor Day in spring of 2021. 50:57 So, we're consistent and we believe we're on track to delivering what we expect and what you would expect in 2022 and 2023.\nKevin Caliendo: 51:07 Thank you for all that detail.\nSteve Rusckowski: 51:09 Thanks.\nOperator: 51:11 Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from  . Your line is open.\nMark Guinan: 51:15 Hey, Jack.\nSteve Rusckowski: 51:15 Hey, Jack.\nJack Meehan: 51:17 Hello, and happy to say, Nephron Research. So, Steve, on 2023, I know still premature to give a specific number, but at the Analyst Day, you talked about 7% to 9% earnings growth, kind of off of an $8 number you were gearing us to at that point? Now, talking about some tale of COVID here too, can you just like make sure we're doing the math right? Can we take 8% grow it, add some COVID on top? There's obviously some other moving parts, but is that the right way to think about it or where am I wrong?\nSteve Rusckowski: 51:57 We're going to refresh all of your memories of what we said in  through.\nMark Guinan: 52:02 Yes. So at that point, we said $7.40 to $8 and then 7% to 9% CAGR from 2022 and beyond. And then as we got further along past Investor Day we started to signal that we would expect it would be closer to the $8 or on the upper end of the range and because 2022 has more COVID revenue, I would just remind everybody, the growth rate in 2023 is going to be below that CAGR, but the absolute number we're saying should still be where you would have calculated it back in March of 2021. So, just happens to be that the pandemic hung around for a little bit longer. 52:47 I also mentioned at Investor Day that we did not assume COVID would go away. So, in that outlook, I had a level kind of a sustained COVID testing, we do expect that COVID testing will be around part of our portfolio. And certainly nowhere here the levels of 2020 and 2021 or even what we're projecting this year, but not insignificant. So, I did not take COVID as upside for that. We certainly have some COVID built into that outlook.\nSteve Rusckowski: 53:13 Yeah, what we said, remember this is the spring of 2021. We expected 2022 to be able to grow that we indicated both topline to bottom line, but we also said and it continues to this day, we expect that COVID will continue to be part of our portfolio of tests going forward. 53:35 So that was 2021, thinking about 2022 the same is true for 2022 going into 2023. So, we're going to come out of 2022 with some COVID testing. You see the volumes we indicate, which is about 10,000 and 15,000 per day. Obviously, we're assuming right now we're a lower price, we will continue to have COVID testing in 2023 and we\u2019ve always assumed in our outlook going forward for growth in the topline and bottom line will be COVID testing  portfolio. 54:04 And frankly, we think it's a good opportunity. Because if you go through the math, even at lower price points, this is a sizable market and we have a good size share right now. We think there\u2019s dynamics to the marketplace and we're working on plans to actually gain share in the COVID testing marketplace that could be with us for the foreseeable future.\nJack Meehan: 54:25 Great. As a follow-up, wanted to ask you about the consumer directed testing. You talked about the growth rate; how much revenue did that area generate in the quarter? And can you also talk about interest beyond COVID? Is there any specific areas of menu that you're targeting or you think are resonating and where that investments getting directed?\nSteve Rusckowski: 54:48 Well, first of all, Jeff, we like to give you specific numbers for the quarter. What we share with you, it grew nicely double-digits on both the base business as well as on COVID. Jim, why don\u2019t you talk about the portfolio and what we're seeing growth in?\nJim Davis : 55:00 Yes. So, Jack, we've talked into the past, there's various segments since consumer initiated testing business. I'll touch on two. One is, we call them watchful warriors, people that have product conditions like diabetes, like cancer, but their insurance company they only pay for, let's just say two A1c test a year and these people worry about the disease that they may come in once the  and get testing. So, it just makes more sense that they do it through us directly rather than have to go to a physician office pay an expensive bill just to get an A1c test. 55:38 So, there's a lot of demand from these types of patients. The second is, we\u2019ve talked about . People who don't want their insurance company to know they are getting tested, they may not want their doctor to know, they may not want their spouse, they may not want their mother or father, you know, some of this is in relation to STD testing. So, it is a big segment for people that value privacy. 56:05 Finally, there's a generation, a much younger generation that may not want to go to the doctor. They don't have a doctor, but they may want to get lab testing done once a year just to check the underlying health of their body. And so, call it the 20 to 26 year old segment that they don't have primary care physicians, but they are concerned about their health. And they come in and get these once a year comprehensive  for overall health. 56:35 There's other areas as well Jack, physical fitness offset, check one more level before marathons and things like that, but those are the primary ones.\nMark Guinan: 56:44 Yes. Jack, we've talked about this previously. We moved this \u2013 what we call blueprint for wellness, which was an offering we gave to employers. It is a battery of diagnostic testing that gives you a good blueprint for how your  and other important metrics. And we're actually offering that now on  testing and people really find that interesting. So, an opportunity to get a full run of diagnostic testing like people have gotten who had employers  we do it for our own employee base and it can be very, very valuable. 57:24 And then obviously if there's anything that\u2019s out of range than go to the doctor. Instead of going to doctor first to get the script.\nSteve Rusckowski: 57:31 Yeah. As Mark said, to, it's a small business particularly on the base business and that number is growing strong double-digits. And what we said is, we're committed to the business dealing of about $250 million in size by 2025. Well, needless to say with the investment that we're making, the new leadership we brought in that Jim indicated and really a very focused organizational model that we have in place. 58:04 We're getting good traction and we believe you're going to start to see acceleration of the revenues we get from it, which should be a net tailwind for us for our growth overall as we go into 2023 and beyond tracking to that $250 million number in  . 58:23 If you just kind of go through the math, you can see this is going to be accretive to our growth in 2023 and 2024 beyond what we've seen so far because the numbers get much more substantial year-on-year to give us a nice lift in our growth rate going forward.\nShawn Bevec: 58:39 Operator, next question.\nOperator: 58:42 Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: 58:47 Hey, good morning guys. Good morning. Just one question. Mark, I know you don't give quarterly guidance and you've given us some color for the guidance for the year, but just any considerations we need to be thinking about as it relates to Q2? And then maybe just on that $30 cost, you mentioned that goes away related \u2013 as COVID volumes go down per test? How quickly does that go away? I'm guessing some of that's payroll and headcount. So, just curious like how does that  function progress over the course of the year, in terms of like eliminating that $30 number?\nMark Guinan: 59:23 Yes. So, that payroll is actually a fee we pay to a partner and that relationship that we have is only permissible during the PHE. So there's absolutely guarantee that when PHE goes away that that payment goes away. So, it's directly 100% correlated to that in addition to some other costs, I mentioned like logistics and so on and so forth. But obviously if we stopped a relationship and stopped the payment, we don't have the logistics cost as well because we're not making those special runs to areas that normally we wouldn't go to pick up specimens. 60:02 So, I think you probably have other pieces Brian, go through it. So, we've talked about a level of testing that\u2019s been averaging about 30,000 here early in the quarter, we talked about a lower level in the second half. So that's one consideration for COVID, you know the PHE is due to the full second quarter. Certainly that's much more of a revenue impact and dollar margin versus percentage margin. 60:29 A change from Q2 to the back half of the year. And then most importantly, we're back to growth mode and every week, every quarter, gives an opportunity to go out and do what we're doing before the pandemic, win over more work with offices grow organically, and all of that will benefit the back half relative to where we were in Q1 and certainly expect to be in Q2. So, COVID rent continue to ramp down, the base business continued to grow, PHE  at least that\u2019s in our guidance, but then also importantly that those incremental costs with the COVID testing will go away with the PHE ending.\nSteve Rusckowski: 61:09 And then just to remind you, what we have told you is this $160 million that we\u2019re investing, we said, we spent about 30 so far. And what we said is in Q2, we've got some investments we're making, particularly we\u2019re releasing a new platform. Okay? So, think about that, someone of this is period expense, it's one-off, okay, but some of this is repeatable that we will see in the back half of the year. 61:34 So some headwinds in the second quarter will be with us. The best that we continue to make, we think in a real great opportunity for us to grow long-term. So, think about that as well. And think about the timing of what will happen when throughout the remainder of the year.\nBrian Tanquilut: 61:52 Appreciate that. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: 61:55 Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik de Bruin: 62:00 Thank you and good morning. So I want \u2013 couple of questions on advanced diagnostic testing. First of all, one of the other public labs that does the oncology testing, talked about weaker volumes, so we're coming out of the pandemic. Could you talk about what you have sort of seen in oncology testing through that market and are you gaining share there? And then as a follow-up to that, your other main competitor has been doing a number of acquisitions and things like with biopsy and the other ones, how are you sort of thinking about building out your pipeline for the advanced market,  booking for potential acquisitions feel better area to enhance or is it all  ? Thank you.\nSteve Rusckowski: 62:46 Absolutely. So, we shared with you strategically what we're doing, okay. Last year, we indicated that our business and our definition of advanced diagnostics is entirely defined around genetics and molecular. In last year, excluding COVID because that is molecular. It was about $1.3 billion in size. Number one. 63:09 Number two is, what we have done is, we have focused on four areas that have indicated in my prepared remarks, that we're putting additional investments in and that \u2013 and those investment dollars are throughout the entire value chain. It's investment upfront and you test in organic convention. It's also in our experience that we work with our physicians and the patients that they serve and that's also around the services that we have to provide, which is not a counseling and with our sales force to be able to have better reach within the markets that we serve. 63:47 So, it's through the full value chain. And what we have been running at historically is to grow 3% to 4% growth in that business. So, what we said in our 2021 Investor Day is we're going to accelerate growth that we\u2019re going to get to high single digits and we indicated today that we're making good progress against that number is about 8%, okay? 64:10 Now in that, majority of the assumption is we're doing that organically with the investments we're making. However, as you know in the past, we paid some selective acquisitions, quick one, particularly Blueprint genetics, which gives us some bioinformatics capability that enhances our capability around genetics. 64:32 And what we indicated last year is that strategy is working. Those areas of growth, okay are growing strong double-digits, and that strong double digits in 2021 versus 2020 and also in 2021 versus 2019 at pre-pandemic levels. So, we feel our organic strategy of investing is working out and then trying with our share is we continue to look at acquisitions that would make sense to enhance our portfolio, but remember we've been very disciplined about doing acquisitions. 65:08 We have very tight criteria for acquisitions where they have to be accretive to our earnings in a reasonable period time, they have to be accretive to our belief around our earnings opportunities around  . They have to be accretive to our growth and therefore when we look at, it's actually buying things versus investing or investing in ourselves, we\u2019re always considering the trade-off of how we continue to build value. 65:35 So, that's been our strategy and our strategy we've put in place is working, it\u2019s ahead of schedule and we feel good about it going forward. Jim, maybe you would like to add to that?\nJim Davis: 65:44 Yes, Derik you asked about our oncology performance. And when we think about our oncology business it is hard to say a solid tumor  holding to that basic pathology work that then fold off  needed. That business is doing well. And has recovered from 2019 levels. And then there's a core hematology business, which has always been a real, real strength of Quest Diagnostics and that business continues to expand. 66:12 So, our oncology portfolio is in good shape. You mentioned liquid biopsy, there certainly is a market and what we referred to is the MRD side that\u2019s Minimal Residual Disease side. We're working on an assay that\u2019s also commercially available assays from our suppliers and we\u2019re considering both. 66:37 In terms of pre-cancer or cancer spring assays, that's a bit more out there. Something we watch as you know, there's 63, 65 start-up companies with the name liquid biopsy that received a   of venture capital money last year. And we're certainly keeping an eye in the space on the space as Steve indicated. If we find one that meets all of our criteria, we\u2019ll look closely at it.\nOperator: 67:07 Our next question comes from Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nSteve Rusckowski: 67:14 Good morning, Ann.\nAnn Hynes: 67:15 Hi, good morning. So, one more margin question. I think the issue is, maybe we are over estimating the margins on COVID back into your big base business, and you refer to your partner, which I'm assuming is CVS that you have to pay that $30 fee, can you tell us what percentage of your test is CVS. So, just to make sure that we are estimating, just kind of the consolidated margin for COVID quickly?\nMark Guinan: 67:44 So, when we talk about non-traditional channels, it's not limited to one partner. And what I can share is that it grew before the person changed to where and it was almost up to half of our volume that was coming from the non-traditional channels and a higher proportion of the traditional volumes was uninsured. 68:15 And since the uninsured volumes have dropped off that proportion has dropped off as well as we go, but it\u2019s still significant. And I would not want to comment specifically on any partner and certainly the one you mentioned is not our only partner.\nJim Davis: 68:35 Yes. And the range, the percent in our volume that comes through these retail partners actually varies. During searches, I would say it's less \u2013 it reduces because we start to then get a lot of specimens from physician offices, urgent care centers, and hospitals. When COVID subsides then that becomes slightly larger percentage of our mix.\nMark Guinan: 69:02 Right. There are  , we can do less cooling and we can take a little bit of a hit on the turnaround time, $25 that is in a lot of the contracts and certainly in CMS\u2019 payments. So, there's a lot of dynamics that can offset each other. And that's why we really  focus people that we can make a reasonable margin on the CMS reimbursement grade on COVID going forward, and it's not the price change will all drop to the bottom line.\nSteve Rusckowski: 69:34 Going back to what's in our numbers and what\u2019s based and what's COVID, I'll keep on really reiterating. Remember, we took advantage of the opportunity we had in 2020 and 2021 to invest in accelerating growth. And those investments take time and they're ahead of schedule and that's going to help us next year, year-on-year. So, think about that too as it kind of goes through the plan for this year into next.\nOperator: 70:05 Our final question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nRachel Vatnsdal: 70:11 Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So, could you just elaborate on the POS contract momentum that you've been seeing, especially  return normal, how should we think about the cadence of those wins and revenue contributions for this year?\nSteve Rusckowski: 70:24 Yes. So, I mentioned in our prepared remarks  that we've announced and our relationships are strong and beginning to demonstrate that we can bring real value to these  delivery systems. Remind you all what it is, is, one is, yes, we help them run there labs and we see what you see one, but they save money and provide household systems are struggling as you know. 70:55 Volumes, yes, in some cases of recoveries like the acuity level of patients and the beds, are higher and they have fixed reimbursement. And then secondly, as they are having inflationary pressure in hospital systems, which has been tougher that to offset. So, that's the first piece. Second is, when we have our relationship, our advanced diagnostics business in our overall sophisticated testing business, which we call reference testing with hospitals also is an opportunity, so we typically bring in a larger share of that with hospitals. 71:29 And then finally, we have an opportunity in some cases to buy their offerings business, which has been nice opportunity for us to build value, which helps us sort of the acquisition target, but also helps us because eventually they are accretive because we know  is quite well. So, it's worked. right? Yes. And going forward the funnel continues to build. We have a dedicated team. We've invested in that as well. Jim and I are entirely engaged together. 71:56 Working a large number of these accounts. We personally do a fair amount of travel and spend time with the management team, engaged in these opportunities. So, we do believe it continues to yield us a nice opportunity going forward to continue to accelerate growth. So, Jim, anything you like to add to that?\nJim Davis: 72:15 I would say that, funnel of opportunities  time negotiate. Obviously,  someone different your helps system laboratory during COVID is that something helps us  trying to. Now that COVID is subsiding, helps us  patients is under control. I think you'll see the deal actually pick-up.\nSteve Rusckowski: 72:48 Okay, great. So thanks again for joining our call. We appreciate your continued support and you all have a great day.\nOperator: 72:56 Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics first quarter 2022 conference call.

            "content": "02:18 Thanks, Shawn and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we're off to a good start in 2022. We drove a strong year-over-year growth in our base business, which excludes COVID-19 testing. COVID-19 volumes remain strong early in the quarter and decreased in February and March, in line with the market. 02:42 We continue to make investments to further accelerate growth in the base business, and our efforts to improve productivity are helping us to offset inflationary pressures. So, based on the strength of our business we're raising our 2022 guidance. This morning, I'll discuss our performance for the first quarter of 2022 and then Mark will provide more detail on the financial results and talk about our updated financial outlook for 2022. 03:12 But first, I like to ask Jim Davis to give us an update on our leadership transition. Jim? 06:18 Thanks, gentlemen. I agree the transition is going well. Now, turning to our results, our base business continued its strong recovery up more than 6% from the prior year. Total revenues were $2.6 billion; earnings per share was $2.92 on a reported basis, and $3.22 on an adjusted basis. Cash provided by operations was $480 million. 06:50 COVID-19 testing revenues were approximately $600 million in the first quarter and that's down approximately 28% from 2021. Nearly 60% of the COVID-19 revenues came from the Omicron peak in January. We project  demand for PCR testing through the end of the year and into 2023, albeit at lower levels. 07:16 The public health emergency was extended into July, maintaining our current level of reimbursement. And based on these factors, we raised our COVID-19 revenue guidance for the full-year of 2022 to between $850 million to $1 billion. 07:36 Turning to our base business, in the first quarter, we continue to make progress executing our two-point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. So, here are some highlights from the quarter. We continue to make in-roads with our health plans, gaining share and increasing revenues faster than the market. 07:58 Our health plan revenues without COVID-19 grew faster that our overall base business did in the quarter. We also deepened relationships with payers through value based contracting. We currently had about 30% of our health plan revenues are tied to value based elements. And these included patient health outcomes, quality or shared savings. 08:23 We think we could grow this about 50% over the next few years. And we believe these value based contracts are achieving better alignment with health plans, which we believe will allow us to gain shares. 08:37 We're also working with our hospital health system leaders to help them execute their last strategy. A lot of partnerships of Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, Memorial Hermann in Texas, and those which really helped that work in  are performing well. 08:58 Hospitals look to us for their help with through laboratory design, staffing and management and we can enable them to monetize outreach lab assets that help them free-up needed capital. We have continued to make important investments to strengthen our advanced diagnostics capabilities and are already seeing results. 09:21 We continue to make investments to accelerate growth in oncology, hematology, hereditary genetics, genomic sequencing services, and power services. Since we've ramped up our investments, and our advanced diagnostics portfolio, we have already accelerated growth by several 100 basis points and expect to deliver the 8% growth earlier than 2024, which we committed to at our 2021 Investor Day. 09:54 We remain excited about the opportunities we see in the direct-to-consumer testing market. As you know, we're ramping up investments in our consumer business and it's having an impact. 10:06 In the quarter, our direct-to-consumer revenues more of than doubled compared to the prior year, driven by strong growth in both our COVID-19 testing operations as well as our base business testing. We're seeing continuous solid demand for  comprehensive metabolic panels and complete blood counts. Also our new and approved digital experience is on track to launch later this year. 10:33 Finally, we've been expanding our diagnostics services portfolio. We are collaborating with a small digital  software firm to deliver diabetic retinal imaging services through designated Quest Diagnostic patient service centers across the United States. This will aid in the screening of patients as part of the diabetes management program. 10:58 The second part of our strategies is to drive operational excellence. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and costs thereby driving productivity gains. We are not immune to the current inflationary environment, but we're tightly managing our operations and are expecting another good year of the bigger rate savings and productivity improvements to help offset these pressures. 11:26 So, by way of our example, our procurement team continues to work with our strategic suppliers to mitigate potential price increases and improved productivities through our long-term relationships. Also today, the team has effectively managed challenges in our global supply chain. 11:46 We also look to our suppliers to deliver innovation to help us a lower overall cost of testing and improved quality. The most recent example is the rollout of our new   that is being deployed across our laboratory network. 12:04 Our new lab in Clifton, New Jersey has been operational for about a year and we are seeing incremental productivity gains from the investment we've made in automation and artificial intelligence. 12:16 Our new   initiative encourages patients to make appointments allowing us to better manage demand and  productivity while enhancing the patient experience. The system has been successfully deployed to over 700 patient service centers. Our continued invested in operations is producing results. And we are well on our way to achieving our targeted productivity gains of 3% of our cost structure in 2022. 12:50 Now, Mark will provide more details on our performance and share more insights and our updated guidance for the remainder of 2022. Mark? 21:30 Thanks Mark. Well to summarize, we're off to a good start in 2022 driving strong year-over-year growth in the base business. We continue to make important investments to accelerate growth and we are seeing the results. Now based on the strength of our base business, we've raised our outlook for the remainder of the year. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? 24:15 Just like to reiterate what Mark said about the base business, just underscore that we're pleased with what we saw in Q1. It would have been better, if it didn't have the softness that Mark talked about in January. We remind everyone that we posted about 6.3% growth in our base business, which had only about 100-days' worth of acquisitions. 24:38 So the organic growth was around five. And again, if January was stronger, it would have been stronger than that. So, we feel good about that to be the start of the year, which gives us confidence for the full-year. So feel bit about the start of the year for our base business. And that gave us the confidence to raise guidance for the full-year beyond COVID. 26:51 Good morning, Patrick. 27:24 Yeah. So, as Mark indicated in his prepared remarks, changing dynamics that are business with investments in the second quarter and then less COVID in the back half of the year and what we indicated we will be coming out of the year in the back half with \u2013 the amount of COVID testing we would expect, there's a good level to think about in 2023. 27:49 And so what we also expect is to continue to get the investment returns that we expect in advanced diagnostics and in consumer testing, starting in the back half, and again, what Mark said in his prepared remarks, and we believe that investment return will be a tailwind for us in 2023. So, this is a transitional year with those investments. Transitional year for COVID, and Mark you like to give a little perspective on Q2 and then the back half? 30:16 So remember too as you think about, as we transition for the year, and Ricky asked about April. We have higher level testing in April going on. We do periodically update you on that. And that number we expect in our guidance to come down. And as we indicated as we come out of 2022, we'll be running around 10,000 to 15,000 tests per day. And we're assuming that the PHE will expire because we didn't know nothing beyond what we've heard so far, which will add sometime in July. 30:51 So, as you think about that transition, and then think about the investments we're making and thinking about the nice momentum we're building in the base business it gives you some perspective of how we're going to come through the three remaining quarters of this year, and then guide us to a reasonable place to be able to deliver what Mark indicated for 2023. 32:29 Yes. Yes. So, we feel good about again, our commitment of 2% growth through acquisitions. As you know, we've delivered that consistently. We feel good about our ability to \u2013 on a routine basis to deliver the consolidation strategy we've been executing against. We've got a few step we are working on and we still feel that we will be able to get to a number close to that 2% in 2022. So, as I have said in the first quarter, we're lighter than that. This is lumpy, but we do expect that we'll be moving on a few in the second quarter and into the third quarter to deliver what we expect. 33:16 Good morning, A.J. 33:56 Yes. So, let me start and then I'll ask Mark and Jim to kind of add to this. As we have said in our strategy here and health plan access change there is a big opportunity for us, number one. Number two is, we do plan that gaining share. And number three, we are gaining shares. So, our health plan revenues are growing faster than overall revenues and we believe growing faster in the markets. So, we're making progress. So, in that regard, the second question is the environment has gotten better. 34:29 We've indicated in prior calls and prior quarters, and it's proven to be true as we go throughout this year. As we get into renegotiations with the plans, we believe we have stronger position to negotiate and in some cases, modest prices because we're delivering more and more value. Our quality is improving, service performance is better, and we have an opportunity to help them narrow the network and narrow the number of providers they have with the number of these programs. 34:59 So, it has gotten better and we indicated that less than 100 basis points overall. I'll remind you that when we talk about price, there's a lot of focus around the plans, but we have price pressures in the hospital business and our client build business, but at least on the health plan side, it has gotten better and we have gotten modest increases for some of the contract renewals that we've had. 35:21 In terms of value-based contracting, the biggest opportunity we have, which you indicated in the past is around United. And United is a very different relationship for us and what we had years ago. It is clearly a relationship that we're working different aspects to be able to pick up share. And as part of that, now it's indicated in my remarks, we do have shared savings opportunities and we have opportunities together to do a better job with their membership than their clients. And then beyond United, we have extended that thinking to other parts of our health plant portfolio with other concepts, they're not all identical. But they have similar characteristics in general where we have better alignment between what they're trying to accomplish and what we're trying to accomplish. 36:13 In the end, we're all trying to achieve what's been described as the  , which is better quality, better experience, at lower cost, and that's resonating very well in the marketplace. Overall, as you know, this is an entirely focused organizations on that  plan for the greater delivery systems as well. So, Mark you like to add something to... 39:39 Good morning, Pito. 40:52 And as you see in our results,   Q1 with about $700 million worth of cash. And obviously, we're going to put that to use to a good way. We're looking at acquisitions as we talked about. And we'll handle that in due course throughout the remainder of the year. 43:25 Good morning, Kevin. 45:20 Yes. As we enter the year, what we indicated for COVID is around 700 to 1 billion and obviously we're delivering 600 million in the first quarter. We have more certainty around what is left within that initial guidance. 45:37 Obviously going into the year, there's a lot of uncertainty of what would happen now,  how fast would decline, and how each testing would go on in the back half of the first quarter. So, the timing up of the range, the asset range is hit by this, as Mark indicated there's puts and takes of this in terms of the impact on our bottom line. But I'll just reiterate, we feel good about our start with our based business and we're tracking well for a strong year based on our initial guidance. 47:02 Remember, we're vesting $160 million, we're vesting   sixty million because we have a strong business piece to get the returns. So, what we had indicated, we are ahead of our plan to get the returns in advanced diagnostics and we feel bullish about the opportunities of the consumer. And the results on both of those fronts have been good news. And so, when we talk about the second part that you mentioned of putting in place a new platform, also where a consumer business we're investing in some marketing to get the growth we expect, and we are getting the results so far and we'll continue to see the results in the back half of the year. 47:43 What we also said is that as we come out of 2022 into 2023, when you think about a year-on-year compare, with the returns we expect from Advanced Diagnostics and the returns we expect from the consumer, that a year-on-year improvement in those businesses will be tailwinds for our margins in 2023. 48:10 So, again, we're investing to grow, we're investing to get a return. We feel good about getting those returns actually quicker than expected, and next year, the year-on-year compare related to that 160 million will be a net tailwind for us in terms of our earnings in 2023. Mark anything you like to add? 50:15 And as Mark said, as we go through thinking by the way, we indicated in our Investor Day, and we're not going to give you 2023 guidance, so Mark indicated is when we think about 2023, we're still believing we're comfortably in the range we would expect in 2023 in terms of EPS in growth. And the second half sets its up nicely and what we've implied in our guidance for the full-year implies a set-up, so we would be able to deliver what Mark indicated in 2023 and a view that we indicated in our Investor Day in spring of 2021. 50:57 So, we're consistent and we believe we're on track to delivering what we expect and what you would expect in 2022 and 2023. 51:09 Thanks. 51:15 Hey, Jack. 51:57 We're going to refresh all of your memories of what we said in  through. 53:13 Yeah, what we said, remember this is the spring of 2021. We expected 2022 to be able to grow that we indicated both topline to bottom line, but we also said and it continues to this day, we expect that COVID will continue to be part of our portfolio of tests going forward. 53:35 So that was 2021, thinking about 2022 the same is true for 2022 going into 2023. So, we're going to come out of 2022 with some COVID testing. You see the volumes we indicate, which is about 10,000 and 15,000 per day. Obviously, we're assuming right now we're a lower price, we will continue to have COVID testing in 2023 and we've always assumed in our outlook going forward for growth in the topline and bottom line will be COVID testing  portfolio. 54:04 And frankly, we think it's a good opportunity. Because if you go through the math, even at lower price points, this is a sizable market and we have a good size share right now. We think there's dynamics to the marketplace and we're working on plans to actually gain share in the COVID testing marketplace that could be with us for the foreseeable future. 54:48 Well, first of all, Jeff, we like to give you specific numbers for the quarter. What we share with you, it grew nicely double-digits on both the base business as well as on COVID. Jim, why don't you talk about the portfolio and what we're seeing growth in? 57:31 Yeah. As Mark said, to, it's a small business particularly on the base business and that number is growing strong double-digits. And what we said is, we're committed to the business dealing of about $250 million in size by 2025. Well, needless to say with the investment that we're making, the new leadership we brought in that Jim indicated and really a very focused organizational model that we have in place. 58:04 We're getting good traction and we believe you're going to start to see acceleration of the revenues we get from it, which should be a net tailwind for us for our growth overall as we go into 2023 and beyond tracking to that $250 million number in  . 58:23 If you just kind of go through the math, you can see this is going to be accretive to our growth in 2023 and 2024 beyond what we've seen so far because the numbers get much more substantial year-on-year to give us a nice lift in our growth rate going forward. 61:09 And then just to remind you, what we have told you is this $160 million that we're investing, we said, we spent about 30 so far. And what we said is in Q2, we've got some investments we're making, particularly we're releasing a new platform. Okay? So, think about that, someone of this is period expense, it's one-off, okay, but some of this is repeatable that we will see in the back half of the year. 61:34 So some headwinds in the second quarter will be with us. The best that we continue to make, we think in a real great opportunity for us to grow long-term. So, think about that as well. And think about the timing of what will happen when throughout the remainder of the year. 62:46 Absolutely. So, we shared with you strategically what we're doing, okay. Last year, we indicated that our business and our definition of advanced diagnostics is entirely defined around genetics and molecular. In last year, excluding COVID because that is molecular. It was about $1.3 billion in size. Number one. 63:09 Number two is, what we have done is, we have focused on four areas that have indicated in my prepared remarks, that we're putting additional investments in and that \u2013 and those investment dollars are throughout the entire value chain. It's investment upfront and you test in organic convention. It's also in our experience that we work with our physicians and the patients that they serve and that's also around the services that we have to provide, which is not a counseling and with our sales force to be able to have better reach within the markets that we serve. 63:47 So, it's through the full value chain. And what we have been running at historically is to grow 3% to 4% growth in that business. So, what we said in our 2021 Investor Day is we're going to accelerate growth that we're going to get to high single digits and we indicated today that we're making good progress against that number is about 8%, okay? 64:10 Now in that, majority of the assumption is we're doing that organically with the investments we're making. However, as you know in the past, we paid some selective acquisitions, quick one, particularly Blueprint genetics, which gives us some bioinformatics capability that enhances our capability around genetics. 64:32 And what we indicated last year is that strategy is working. Those areas of growth, okay are growing strong double-digits, and that strong double digits in 2021 versus 2020 and also in 2021 versus 2019 at pre-pandemic levels. So, we feel our organic strategy of investing is working out and then trying with our share is we continue to look at acquisitions that would make sense to enhance our portfolio, but remember we've been very disciplined about doing acquisitions. 65:08 We have very tight criteria for acquisitions where they have to be accretive to our earnings in a reasonable period time, they have to be accretive to our belief around our earnings opportunities around  . They have to be accretive to our growth and therefore when we look at, it's actually buying things versus investing or investing in ourselves, we're always considering the trade-off of how we continue to build value. 65:35 So, that's been our strategy and our strategy we've put in place is working, it's ahead of schedule and we feel good about it going forward. Jim, maybe you would like to add to that? 67:14 Good morning, Ann. 69:34 Going back to what's in our numbers and what's based and what's COVID, I'll keep on really reiterating. Remember, we took advantage of the opportunity we had in 2020 and 2021 to invest in accelerating growth. And those investments take time and they're ahead of schedule and that's going to help us next year, year-on-year. So, think about that too as it kind of goes through the plan for this year into next. 70:24 Yes. So, I mentioned in our prepared remarks  that we've announced and our relationships are strong and beginning to demonstrate that we can bring real value to these  delivery systems. Remind you all what it is, is, one is, yes, we help them run there labs and we see what you see one, but they save money and provide household systems are struggling as you know. 70:55 Volumes, yes, in some cases of recoveries like the acuity level of patients and the beds, are higher and they have fixed reimbursement. And then secondly, as they are having inflationary pressure in hospital systems, which has been tougher that to offset. So, that's the first piece. Second is, when we have our relationship, our advanced diagnostics business in our overall sophisticated testing business, which we call reference testing with hospitals also is an opportunity, so we typically bring in a larger share of that with hospitals. 71:29 And then finally, we have an opportunity in some cases to buy their offerings business, which has been nice opportunity for us to build value, which helps us sort of the acquisition target, but also helps us because eventually they are accretive because we know  is quite well. So, it's worked. right? Yes. And going forward the funnel continues to build. We have a dedicated team. We've invested in that as well. Jim and I are entirely engaged together. 71:56 Working a large number of these accounts. We personally do a fair amount of travel and spend time with the management team, engaged in these opportunities. So, we do believe it continues to yield us a nice opportunity going forward to continue to accelerate growth. So, Jim, anything you like to add to that? 72:48 Okay, great. So thanks again for joining our call. We appreciate your continued support and you all have a great day."

            "content": "12:59 Thanks, Steve. In first quarter, consolidated revenues were 2.61 billion, down 4% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 6.3% to more than 2 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 27.6% to approximately 600 million. Revenues for Diagnostic information services declined 3.9% compared to the prior year. The decline reflected lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the first quarter of 2021, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. 13:39 Total volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 1.3% versus the prior year and was roughly flat under an organic basis. Total base testing volumes increased more than 6% versus the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, total base testing volumes grew nearly 5%. We experienced some modest softening of base testing volumes in January during the peak of the Omicron surge. The volume has rebounded in February and March. 14:11 COVID-19 testing volumes surged during the spread of Omicron variant during the winter and volumes peaked in January, but declined through the month of February and into March. Together with our JV partners in our Quest, we resulted approximately 7.2 million molecular tests. 14:30 Quest  resulted roughly 6.3 million molecular test, down approximately 2 million tests and 1 million tests versus the prior year in fourth quarter respectively. We also resulted nearly 450,000 serology tests in the first quarter. Our COVID-19 molecular volumes have generally stabilized and the average of roughly 30,000 tests per day over the last four weeks, excluding similar request. 14:59 Revenue per acquisition declined 5.2% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rep was up modestly. Importantly, we continue to see an improving price environment. Unit price reimbursement pressure was less than 100 basis points in the quarter. 15:21 Reported operating income in the first quarter was 513 million or 19.7% of revenues compared to 660 million or 24.3% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was 554 million or 21.2% of revenues, compared to 708 million or 26% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income was primarily related to lower COVID-19 testing volumes, a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from non-traditional channels, which carry additional expenses or logistics costs, investments to accelerate growth in our base business and lower average reimbursements for COVID-19 molecular tests. These   were partially offset by strong growth in our base business. 16:16 As many of you have heard, the health resources and services administration or HRSA, stopped accepting claims to pass and treat uninsured patients on March 22, due to insufficient funding.  runs the program to provide funding for COVID-19 testing vaccination and treatment for uninsured patients. Approximately 14% of our COVID-19 molecular testing volume has come from uninsured patients, which is much higher than the 1% to 2% we typically see in our base business. 16:50 As a result, we were unable to build HRSA to over 20 million in COVID-19 testing work that was performed just prior to the March 23 HRSA cut-off date. Moving forward, we are now dealing uninsured patients for COVID-19 testing directly upfront. As a result, we've seen a decline in our uninsured COVID-19 molecular testing volumes in late March and into April, and this is reflected in trends I shared earlier. 17:19 Reported EPS was $2.92 in the quarter, compared to $3.46 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $3.22, compared to $3.76 last year. Cash provided by operations was $480 million in Q1 versus $731 million in the prior year period. And we repurchased 350 million of stock during the first quarter. 17:47 Now, turning to our updated guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between 9.2 billion and 9.5 billion, a decline of approximately 12% to 15% versus the prior year. Base business revenues are expected to be between 8.35 billion and 8.5 billion, an increase of approximately 4% to 6%. 18:10 COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between 850 million and 1 billion, a decline of approximately 64% to 69%. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.88 and $8.38, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $9 and $9.50. Cash provided by operations is expected to be at least 1.6 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 400 million. 18:43 Before concluding, I'll touch on some assumptions embedded in our updated 2022 guidance, as well as some additional considerations. Our guidance assumes COVID-19 molecular volumes to average approximately 10,000 to 20,000 tests per day for the rest of the year. This reflects modest continued declines in Q2 from the roughly 30,000 tests per day we are seeing in April. And some degree of stabilization during the second half of the year. 19:12 As we look toward 2023, our expectation for COVID-19 molecular and serology testing volumes assumes that the COVID-19 testing run rates in the second half of 2022 continues into next year. 19:27 Last week, the public health emergency was again extended another 90 days through mid-July. We assume average reimbursements of COVID-19 molecular testing to hold relatively steady through this period, while the public health emergency  renewed beyond July, additional extensions are not captured in our guidance. 19:47 We remain prepared for additional future surges collecting COVID-19 testing volume from a range of customers. While the PHE is in effect, we continue to incur incremental costs from non-traditional channels for supplies, special logistics  and channel expenses for this volume, which can represent roughly $30 in incremental cost per test. Therefore, you should not assume the higher reimbursement due to the PHE extension drops right to the bottom line. 20:16 As Steve noted earlier, we're already seeing some returns in our investments to accelerate growth, particularly in the areas of advanced diagnostics and direct-to-consumer testing. And would expect a margin tailwind on these investments in 2023. 20:33 As a reminder, we are planning to spend approximately 160 million on these investments this year. We spent approximately 30 million in the first quarter and are looking for these investments to ramp up in Q2 to support the launch of our new consumer site later this year. A portion of these stand-up IP costs are temporary, but variable marketing costs will increase   launch of the new site. 20:58 We'll also be adding additional headcount this year to support our consumer offering, as well as bioinformatics capabilities within advanced diagnostics. 21:08 Finally, we know there's a lot focus on expectations for 2023. While it's clearly too early to provide specific guidance for next year based on everything we know and see today, we expect to deliver topline and earnings consistent with our long-term outlook that we provided at our 2021 Investor Day. I'll now turn it back to Steve. 22:33 Yes. Ricky thanks for the question. As you look at the way the quarter played out, Omicron was more severe than we had anticipated, which drove higher COVID revenues, but we also saw the base business impacted by that. So, definitely in January as we mentioned the base business was softer, so relative to our expectations in Q1 more COVID, less base business, but as we exited the quarter and certainly as we talked about in February and March the base business bounced back to our expectations. 23:08 So, while we're very pleased with where we see the base business, growth for the year, it would have been even higher had it not been for Omicron. And the margin is really were what we were expecting. So, we walked through in the last call how some of the margin impacts in Q4 was really temporary around annual incentive plan and some costs related to some special things that we needed to do for COVID testing in that quarter, some over time that we're having in fair amount of  and some things that we really saw as temporary. 23:44 Look  is that once we got the Omicron, those costs, generally did go away and we anticipate further reduction in some of the special expenses related to COVID safety and protection for employees that we continue to advance hopefully and get into the endemic and end of the pandemic. So, I'd say other than the higher COVID revenue and a little lower base in January, generally the  is expected, and that's why we're comfortable raising the bottom and upper end of our guidance at the midpoint. 24:56 One additional comment on that. When you look at the compares, the easiest compare on the basis was Q1. So, to Steve's point, we've credited that even better. We would have done it better than the 6.3 of January not been impacted by Omicron, but as we go through the balance of the year, it compares to get a little tougher because lot the recovery from other pandemic, occurred late in 2020 and early in 2021. So, the growth going forward is more going to be driven by share and less about utilization and the market recovery. 25:47 Yes. So, the business continues to perform at a high level as it was happening in Q1. So, it wouldn't be updated in our guidance if we weren't confident that what we saw in terms of the performance early is continued. So, we're more focused on overall growth as opposed to the percentage year-over-year because obviously the compare makes it complicated. So, we're very happy as we get into April and we see the performance of our base business. And as we mentioned, COVID is kind of stabilized. We're not sure how long that will continue. We certainly took a little bit of a volume hit from the change in HRSA. 26:25 And because there's been a little bit of a spike I'd say some of that was partially offset by the market growing a little bit recently. So that's probably the way you get to a reasonably flat level of COVID testing over the last month. 28:22 Yes. And I'll try to answer your questions Patrick. So, on inflation, we talked about building in an extra 100 basis points or so in our wages costs. And that was in our original guidance. And through 3.5 months of the year we haven't seen anything that suggests that wasn't a reasonable assumption. So, basically, inflation was about where we're expecting. And I'd say, our non-wage items, such as materials and supplies and so on, surely fuel costs have been bouncing around, but nothing has deviated significantly from our critical assumptions coming into the year around inflation. 29:03 The PHE is significant revenue and from a dollar margin perspective, it certainly is helpful, but from a percentage margin and perspective, I want to be clear that it's not significantly higher than the post PHE world because those costs go away that reference, that are more than $30. So, the people are focused on percentage margins, the base is not a big change in terms of what you will see. 29:03 And I guess the important thing is that as the base volume grows, we've always shared that incremental organic growth in the base business as a very high level of drop through. So, the other margin consideration as we grow as we expected and as we've signaled in our guidance, that that will help drive margin expansion. And then finally, just a reminder that we are in a much better place in price than we've been historically. And so, therefore, a lot of the  productivity savings that in the past help pay for inflation,  inflation is a little bit worse. Certainly the pricing environment is better. So, there's more of that to cover that inflation and also to drive bottom line margin expansion. 31:35 Sure. So, our capital priorities haven't changed. We have that commitment return majority of free cash flow as we shared, you know normal times we get pretty close with the dividend and we do some share repurchases to offset dilution, obviously with the COVID  cash generation, and we've had the inability to deploy more cash. We always preferred to do M&A because we've got very high standards around the deals that we executed. So, would always be the preference, but at given point in time, given our strong cash from the balance sheet and our ability to generate cash, we're not going to sit on it. 32:13 So, the 350 million in the first quarter is more of a reflection of how much cash we had at year-end and the fact that we didn't do a transaction in Q1 as opposed any change in priority. So, Steve, would you want to comment on the pipeline? 37:55 Yeah. The only thing I'll add, A.J. is, there's elements in those contracts, that Jim just described. The one I'll add is also  we've talked about in the past, when we do an acquisition of hospital outreach, and instead of the rates immediately dropping to our rates, there's a step down a majority of our large contracts right now. So, we kind to share the value of movement network through an acquisitions, which aligned our incentives and really the greatest value is, is it moves the conversation around away from price being the way they create value and more towards  which Jim talked about and partnering and working together to get connections of work to  better price, but also there's things that come with it that benefit the patients, the physicians, it's our tools and our technology, it's our quality. 38:50 I mean, you know that in the  , it's not about the price, it's really about a couple of the metrics around quality and tools and I mean what is their experience in the patient drop center to how we feed the data to the payer and the frequency in quality. So, there's a lot beyond price that determines  space and that's where we've been successful in moving the conversation. 39:16 And yes, then within the contracts themselves, there will be shared savings and these other value driven parameters that can get us a better price or more value as we demonstrate to them where we're creating value for them as well. 40:21 Yes. At this point, the share repurchases is definitely done pretty much offset our equity programs. So, it's not there's a huge decline in waste so based on what we've done. And in terms of going forward, it'd be dependent on M&A opportunities versus buybacks. So, there's no material change in our way so contemplated in our guidance so it is to what we gave back to . 41:38 Yes. So, I would not want to take away an implication of margin compression Pito. And remember that we don't do point estimates. We do ranges. So, there's a lot of moving parts, everything from topline mix, clinical mix, exactly, precisely, how much COVID testing we get going forward. And share obviously deployment of cash. 42:04 So that's why we give a range. So, we feel very good about the margins. We would expect that the margins would improve on the base business going forward. Certainly, the COVID elements and everything from the PHE to the volume we have could impact margins as well. 42:21 I'll give you one example if you're looking at income margin, certainly some of the JVs where specifically some of our Quest where they have done a lot of COVID testing, we have no revenue, but we get their earnings contribution from that. So, there's a lot of things that they kind of skew margins, but I think what people really want to understand is the base business. 42:41 So, what's going to happen going into 2023? We're very comfortable with the base business, we'll be at or above pre-pandemic levels and we'll have a larger base business in 2023 with some level of COVID testing and in the margin performance that you saw in Q1, we're not expecting it to erode, even despite the factor, we did talk about raising up some of our CIT investments in Q2. So, it's also been contemplated, it's all in that range of guidance and so it's kind of hard to pin down specific margin at this point, but it's not bad news. 43:58 So, the guidance range was related to the totality of the business. And again, if you look at Q1 as we shared, the base business was  extremely well. Didn't do as well as we expected when we entered the year because of Omicron. 44:15 So, some of the raise in COVID for the year and the performance in Q1 was really offsetting a slightly softer base business. Now, the good news is that the base business came back. So that softness in the base business was temporary. The other dynamic is that, we do have the PHE being extended and we also have this change in HRSA, which is not insignificant. So, we mentioned there was over $20 million of loss opportunity that will get paid for the uninsured from more than we did in late March. 44:49 So, there's a lot of moving pieces here, and so it's really hard to parse precisely what is driving the rate, it's really our greater confidence in the business performance for the year in totality with all of those pieces. And so again, well a lot people focus as they rightly understood on the midpoint, I'd say just in general business is in better shape and in total than we would have expected 90 days ago and that's why we're comfortable raising both the topline in the bottom line. 48:31 Yes. So, just a reminder that we shared a view that we could  business to   by 2025. And remember, especially if you strip out the COVID testing revenue this was a business that was small millions, not that long ago. So, very significant growth projected in this business and we're still very comfortable and confident. We just talked about the performance in this past quarter and we don't have our new customer experience IT capability that we think is really going to make a difference in terms of the ease and use of that site. 49:09 So, as Steve said, we'll create tailwinds because we'll be investing less relative to the revenue. But in terms of the margin, what I'd say is, on the business ex-consumer, the margins will be as good or better than you're used to talking about pre-pandemic. But we will have a sizable consumer business that is still an investment mode because we're still looking to grow. So, the overall enterprise margin you should not expect to be expanded. The good news is, we would expect stronger growth. 49:44 And as for some reason that consumer business doesn't deliver and we can turn off the marketing expense. So, it's not as if we're adding tons of people or infrastructure or costs. So, we're very confident in our ability to grow that business. We want to invest to optimize that growth for a period of time, it is going to improve its bottom line next year relative to this year and then certainly over the years beyond that, we would expect to have a nice healthy margin on that business as well. And it will be quite sizeable. 51:15 Hey, Jack. 52:02 Yes. So at that point, we said $7.40 to $8 and then 7% to 9% CAGR from 2022 and beyond. And then as we got further along past Investor Day we started to signal that we would expect it would be closer to the $8 or on the upper end of the range and because 2022 has more COVID revenue, I would just remind everybody, the growth rate in 2023 is going to be below that CAGR, but the absolute number we're saying should still be where you would have calculated it back in March of 2021. So, just happens to be that the pandemic hung around for a little bit longer. 52:47 I also mentioned at Investor Day that we did not assume COVID would go away. So, in that outlook, I had a level kind of a sustained COVID testing, we do expect that COVID testing will be around part of our portfolio. And certainly nowhere here the levels of 2020 and 2021 or even what we're projecting this year, but not insignificant. So, I did not take COVID as upside for that. We certainly have some COVID built into that outlook. 56:44 Yes. Jack, we've talked about this previously. We moved this \u2013 what we call blueprint for wellness, which was an offering we gave to employers. It is a battery of diagnostic testing that gives you a good blueprint for how your  and other important metrics. And we're actually offering that now on  testing and people really find that interesting. So, an opportunity to get a full run of diagnostic testing like people have gotten who had employers  we do it for our own employee base and it can be very, very valuable. 57:24 And then obviously if there's anything that's out of range than go to the doctor. Instead of going to doctor first to get the script. 59:23 Yes. So, that payroll is actually a fee we pay to a partner and that relationship that we have is only permissible during the PHE. So there's absolutely guarantee that when PHE goes away that that payment goes away. So, it's directly 100% correlated to that in addition to some other costs, I mentioned like logistics and so on and so forth. But obviously if we stopped a relationship and stopped the payment, we don't have the logistics cost as well because we're not making those special runs to areas that normally we wouldn't go to pick up specimens. 60:02 So, I think you probably have other pieces Brian, go through it. So, we've talked about a level of testing that's been averaging about 30,000 here early in the quarter, we talked about a lower level in the second half. So that's one consideration for COVID, you know the PHE is due to the full second quarter. Certainly that's much more of a revenue impact and dollar margin versus percentage margin. 60:29 A change from Q2 to the back half of the year. And then most importantly, we're back to growth mode and every week, every quarter, gives an opportunity to go out and do what we're doing before the pandemic, win over more work with offices grow organically, and all of that will benefit the back half relative to where we were in Q1 and certainly expect to be in Q2. So, COVID rent continue to ramp down, the base business continued to grow, PHE  at least that's in our guidance, but then also importantly that those incremental costs with the COVID testing will go away with the PHE ending. 67:44 So, when we talk about non-traditional channels, it's not limited to one partner. And what I can share is that it grew before the person changed to where and it was almost up to half of our volume that was coming from the non-traditional channels and a higher proportion of the traditional volumes was uninsured. 68:15 And since the uninsured volumes have dropped off that proportion has dropped off as well as we go, but it's still significant. And I would not want to comment specifically on any partner and certainly the one you mentioned is not our only partner. 69:02 Right. There are  , we can do less cooling and we can take a little bit of a hit on the turnaround time, $25 that is in a lot of the contracts and certainly in CMS' payments. So, there's a lot of dynamics that can offset each other. And that's why we really  focus people that we can make a reasonable margin on the CMS reimbursement grade on COVID going forward, and it's not the price change will all drop to the bottom line."

            "content": "03:19 Yeah, thank you Steve. We are making very good progress on the transition. Yesterday, we announced a series of organizational changes and leadership appointments of seasoned executive designed to help us accelerated growth and drive operational excellence. First category is a Senior Vice President of the regional businesses. Kathy has deep knowledge of our business gained through three decades of leadership at Quest. She will oversee the regional and enterprise operations, the commercial organization and marketing. She will also be responsible for driving operational excellence, including   for company's quality and productivity initiatives. 04:01 Next, Carrie Eglinton Manner is taking on an expanded role as Senior Vice President, , Advanced and General Diagnostics Clinical Solutions. For more than five years, Carrie has been responsible for bringing innovative solutions to the market through Quest clinical franchises. Before joining Quest, Carrie had nearly two decades of leadership experience in healthcare and medical technologies. 04:25 Patrick Plewman, who has led our West region and has been with Quest Diagnostics for more than nine years is named Senior Vice President, Diagnostics Services, which is a portfolio of data driven analytics and services businesses, which enabled employers, providers, pharma companies, and others to deliver healthcare more effectively and efficiently. This portfolio includes employer population health, employer solutions, ExamOne, Healthcare Analytics Solutions, and Quest HealthConnect. And before joining Quest, Patrick had over 20 years of leadership experience in the biotech and molecular diagnostics industries. 05:09 Mark Delaney has joined Quest as Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Mark has responsibility for the commercial team, including sales and sales operations. Previously, he helped senior sales and marketing leadership roles over his 30 year career at GE Healthcare and Hillrom. 05:29 And finally, Richard Adams has joined Quest as Vice President and General Manager of our Consumer Initiated Testing Business, a new role. Richard has two decades of varied leadership experience in e-commerce, digital marketing, and customer experience, and will lead our rapidly growing direct-to-consumer testing business. These appointments demonstrate the investment strength of our management team and we're really excited about the leadership and expertise that both Mark and Richard Adams will bring to us. 06:00 Additionally, we're making very good progress on our CFO selection process and are on track to name a leader in the next several months. The management transition is going very well and the changes we've announced yesterday are an important step in positioning us for the future. 06:16 Steve, I'll now turn it back to you. 36:37 Yes. So, A.J., personally we think about value based care and arrangements. This is not necessarily being . So, this is being indicated with both United Healthcare  many of these value based care incentives come to us through performance on leakage agreements where they provide us list of physicians that are using how to connect for   and what we move that for, there's a value base, there's an incentive for Quest. 37:07 We proactively work with both payers on moving work out of extensive health system laboratories. If selective  list of physicians that are using that those labs and we go after it. Finally, we worked hand in hand with both of those plans and others on approaching employers and getting employers to see the benefits of steering their employees to the independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. 37:34 When we do enter into these capitated arrangements, I can assure you going forward, we're going to have a much greater stake in what we call the clinical pathways that are used by physicians to ensure that utilization makes sense for the clinical condition that the physician diagnosed. 55:00 Yes. So, Jack, we've talked into the past, there's various segments since consumer initiated testing business. I'll touch on two. One is, we call them watchful warriors, people that have product conditions like diabetes, like cancer, but their insurance company they only pay for, let's just say two A1c test a year and these people worry about the disease that they may come in once the  and get testing. So, it just makes more sense that they do it through us directly rather than have to go to a physician office pay an expensive bill just to get an A1c test. 55:38 So, there's a lot of demand from these types of patients. The second is, we've talked about . People who don't want their insurance company to know they are getting tested, they may not want their doctor to know, they may not want their spouse, they may not want their mother or father, you know, some of this is in relation to STD testing. So, it is a big segment for people that value privacy. 56:05 Finally, there's a generation, a much younger generation that may not want to go to the doctor. They don't have a doctor, but they may want to get lab testing done once a year just to check the underlying health of their body. And so, call it the 20 to 26 year old segment that they don't have primary care physicians, but they are concerned about their health. And they come in and get these once a year comprehensive  for overall health. 56:35 There's other areas as well Jack, physical fitness offset, check one more level before marathons and things like that, but those are the primary ones. 65:44 Yes, Derik you asked about our oncology performance. And when we think about our oncology business it is hard to say a solid tumor  holding to that basic pathology work that then fold off  needed. That business is doing well. And has recovered from 2019 levels. And then there's a core hematology business, which has always been a real, real strength of Quest Diagnostics and that business continues to expand. 66:12 So, our oncology portfolio is in good shape. You mentioned liquid biopsy, there certainly is a market and what we referred to is the MRD side that's Minimal Residual Disease side. We're working on an assay that's also commercially available assays from our suppliers and we're considering both. 66:37 In terms of pre-cancer or cancer spring assays, that's a bit more out there. Something we watch as you know, there's 63, 65 start-up companies with the name liquid biopsy that received a   of venture capital money last year. And we're certainly keeping an eye in the space on the space as Steve indicated. If we find one that meets all of our criteria, we'll look closely at it. 68:35 Yes. And the range, the percent in our volume that comes through these retail partners actually varies. During searches, I would say it's less \u2013 it reduces because we start to then get a lot of specimens from physician offices, urgent care centers, and hospitals. When COVID subsides then that becomes slightly larger percentage of our mix. 72:15 I would say that, funnel of opportunities  time negotiate. Obviously,  someone different your helps system laboratory during COVID is that something helps us  trying to. Now that COVID is subsiding, helps us  patients is under control. I think you'll see the deal actually pick-up."

I\u2019d now like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead, sir.\nShawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.\nJim Davis: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. For the full-year 2023, we delivered strong revenue growth of 7% in our base business and delivered on our earnings commitment as we transitioned away from COVID testing. The results we announced this morning reflect a strong fourth quarter and full year for our base business, in which we made substantial progress on our strategy to drive top-line growth across our core customer channels and improve profitability. Throughout the year, we advanced our growth strategy with innovative testing solutions, new and expanded relationships with health systems and a robust pipeline of M&A and professional lab services opportunities. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in several clinical areas, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology. We also strengthened our oncology offering with a strategic investment in higher growth, minimal residual disease testing. In addition, our efforts to improve quality and productivity delivered our invigorate goal, which helped us to offset the cost headwinds we faced throughout the year. This morning, we issued guidance for 2024 that reflects a return to overall revenue growth, while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues for making this happen. Every day, they bring our purpose to life, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. Before discussing highlights from 2023, I'd like to share some recent regulatory updates. First, as you know, Congress once again delayed Medicare reimbursement cuts and the next data collection process under PAMA that were scheduled to take place in 2024. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to work closely with our trade association to seek a permanent fix to PAMA through SALSA, the saving access to Laboratory Services Act. ACLA's highest priority this year is to secure passage of SALSA. Second, ACLA and nearly 7,000 other individuals and groups submitted comments last quarter on a rule proposed by the FDA to regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. Lab-developed tests are essential medical innovations that are already highly regulated under federal legislation known as CLIA. In addition to the oversight by states, accredited bodies and Medicare as it makes coverage determinations. If enacted, the FDA's proposed rule would compromise patient access to a central lab testing. It would also slow diagnostic innovation and add unnecessary health care costs. We agree with ACLA that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate LDTs and believe that resuming discussions with the FDA, Congress, ACLA and other stakeholders on a legislative solution is the most prudent path forward. Now I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the fourth quarter. Then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers: physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency, workforce experience and service. Here are some updates on the progress we have made in these areas in the fourth quarter. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered mid-single-digit base business revenue growth. We attribute this growth to return to care, overall market growth and share gains driven by the competitive strengths of our scale and innovative offerings. We continue to execute hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions, which generate volume for our physician channel. In January, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire select assets of Lenco, an independent New York-based laboratory company and expect to complete the transaction later this quarter. In addition, we acquired outreach assets of Steward Health Care, which will deepen our reach to patients in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio. As we said earlier, our acquisition pipeline is very strong, and we expect to complete additional transactions in 2024. Our strong relationships with health plans were also a key driver of growth in 2023 as we grew revenues from health plans by high single-digits versus the prior year. As we've indicated, we successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled in 2023. Health plans and self-insured employer clients recognize the clinical and economic value we deliver to them and their members. To date, more than half of health plan revenues now come from value-based contracts, which enable faster growth compared to our traditional health plan contracts. In addition, working with health plans, we continue to reduce so-called lab leakage to high-cost out-of-network labs, partly by redirecting the volume to Quest. Importantly, this is good for both patients as well as employers, which pay for the majority of health care costs. In hospital lab services, we drove high single-digit base business revenue growth in the fourth quarter with strength in both reference and professional laboratory services. Hospital reference testing, in particular, grew much faster than historical trends and well above our estimated growth for the market. Increasingly, health systems recognize that our innovative laboratory testing and collaborative lab management solutions can help them improve quality, productivity, affordability and care. They also continue to face labor and cost pressures prompting more of them to reach out to us to help with their lab strategy. Our professional lab services help manage a hospital's lab, supply chain and workforce. We also provide insights from our analytical solutions to help hospitals manage utilization to deliver the right test to the right patient at the right time. In the fourth quarter, we completed two PLS relationships that will contribute modest growth in the first quarter of this year. We also provide health systems the opportunity to transition their non-core outreach laboratory assets to us through acquisitions. By selling their outreach assets to Quest, these hospitals are better able to redeploy scarce capital to areas of their business that have a greater impact on patient care. Our consumer-initiated testing service, questhealth.com, generated revenues of approximately $45 million in the full year 2023, with strong base business growth. Our return on ad spend and customer acquisition costs remained favorable in the fourth quarter. Another element of our CIT strategy is to drive revenue growth through channel partners. In 2023, we generated more than $30 million through this channel. We are also excited about new product releases in 2024, including blood testing for PFAS or forever chemicals via questhealth.com. PFAS chemicals have been used in industrial and consumer products for decades and may contaminate food and water. In late January, the CDC issued new guidelines that recognize the value of PFAS blood testing for individuals that may have elevated exposure levels, which may increase risk of kidney cancer, eye cholesterol and other health conditions. According to a study in the Journal of Endocrine Society, PFAS chemicals accounted for approximately $22 billion in U.S. health care costs in 2018. In Advanced diagnostics, we experienced double-digit growth across several clinical areas in the fourth quarter, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology. Growth in neurology was driven largely by our Alzheimer's disease portfolio of tests, which is among the most comprehensive in the fast-evolving field of Alzheimer's care. Our innovations include our AV detect blood test for early risk assessment based on amyloid beta proteins and Apo lead genetic risk. This week, we also added P-Tau181 to our AV detect blood test line to complement insights from amyloid beta testing. In addition, our Alzheimer's disease test portfolio includes several CSF tests for diagnosis and monitoring based on amyloid beta, P-Tau181 and Apo lead. We intend to add additional biomarkers later this year and continue to expand our menu. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are on track to launch our Haystack minimal residual disease test to physicians later this year from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas. We also believe Haystack MRD can help support clinical research and recently announced clinical trial collaborations using this innovative technology with the Rutgers Cancer Institute, Alliance Foundation trials in TriSalus Life Sciences. In the fourth quarter, we announced a collaboration with Universal DX, which has developed an innovative blood test for screening for colorectal cancer, including precancerous lesions. We look forward to supporting Universal's effort to gain regulatory approval for this test. Through our collaboration with Scipher, we are expanding patient access to the PRISM-RA test for aiding treatment selection for rheumatoid arthritis. Turning to operational excellence. Our Invigorate program delivered our targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. Here are three examples of how we're improving operations. First, we continue to make progress in using front-end automation to enhance specimen processing. In 2023, we completed front-end automation upgrades in our Pittsburgh and Dallas laboratories, which will improve quality and productivity. This year, we'll add five additional sites. Second, we also expanded the use of AI to improve quality, efficiency and workforce experience in several clinical areas. AI can quickly identify patterns that signify possible disease and digital images of patient cultures and slides. In 2023, we expanded the use of AI in microbiology to help identify bacteria as well as in cytogenetics to identify chromosomal abnormalities. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the opportunities to use AI in several additional clinical areas including cytology, pathology and parasitology. Third, in 2023, we deployed an AI tool at our Clifton lab that helps laboratory staff continuously identify ways to be more productive in their daily routines. And we look forward to introducing this AI job helper in other labs and support processes. Finally, we made significant progress improving the margins of our base business in 2023. I'd like to personally thank our Quest colleagues whose efforts have helped make this possible. With that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam?\nSam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.29 billion, down 1.9% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 4.7% to $2.25 billion. While COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 80% to $37 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 2% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 5.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition declined 3.5% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec was up 0.2%. Unit price reimbursement was positive and consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $267 million or 11.7% of revenues compared to $135 million or 5.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $338 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $330 million or 14.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income is related primarily to growth in the base business, actions taken in 2023 to reduce support costs and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases, higher employee health care costs and higher deferred compensation expense. Reported EPS was $1.70 in the quarter compared to $0.87 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.15 compared to $1.98 last year. Cash from operations was $1.27 billion for full-year 2023 versus $1.72 billion in the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 testing revenue. Finally, our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.6% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.71 to $0.75 per share or $3 per share annually effective with the dividend payable in April 2024. The company has raised its dividend annually since 2011. Turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.35 billion and $9.45 billion. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.69 to $7.99 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.60 to $8.90. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. We have posted a presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website that includes an adjusted earnings bridge, which shows some of the key elements to bridge from our 2023 adjusted EPS to the 2024 adjusted EPS guidance we shared today. Our 2024 guidance reflects the following consideration. We are no longer providing detailed base business and COVID revenue guidance. However, note that we are assuming that COVID revenues will decline at least $175 million in 2024, which will partially offset the growth we expect from the base business. Most of the COVID headwind in 2024 will occur during the first quarter as we generated $119 million of COVID revenue in Q1 last year. In terms of M&A, our guidance only contemplates acquisitions that have been announced or closed to date, including the outreach acquisitions from NewYork-Presbyterian and Stewart Health Care, as well as Lenco, the independent lab Jim mentioned earlier. We will absorb the full year of dilution from our acquisition of Haystack Oncology with an increment impact of approximately $0.20 to adjusted EPS in 2024. We made strong progress improving our base business operating margins in 2023 and expect margin expansion in 2024. We anticipate net interest expense to increase to approximately $190 million in 2024 as a result of higher borrowings following our debt issuance in November. We assume a roughly flat share count compared to the end of 2023. We are expecting adjusted EPS in Q1 to be roughly 21% of our full year earnings. This is slightly below the typical seasonality and reflects the significant amount of weather disruption we've experienced in January. At this point, we anticipate a weather headwind of $0.05 to $0.07 in Q1. And finally, as Jim mentioned earlier, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. With that, I'll now turn it back to Jim.\nJim Davis: Thanks, Sam. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to remember Dr. Paul A. Brown, who passed away in January of this year. In 1967, Dr. Brown founded MetPath, the predecessor company of Quest Diagnostics, providing basic lab services from his apartment in New York City. Dr. Brown was a pioneer who invented the blueprint for our industry that today is recognized as essential to quality health care, and we are grateful for his vision and leadership. To summarize, we delivered strong base business revenue growth in 2023 and achieved our EPS commitments. Our guidance in 2024 reflects a return to total revenue growth while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. And I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues who bring our purpose to life every single day, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] And our first question of the day will come from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Probably one for Sam, just on the margin outlook for '24. Can you just expand a little bit on expectations there, including maybe the cadence for the year. And then just on the margin front with PAMA, obviously, the push out, it's not a function of you getting any windfall by any means, but just that potential headwind being alleviated. Were there investments that you guys were kind of holding off on until you got more clarity on the outcome there? And then as you plan the budget, you green lit with some more of those as PAMA got pushed out. Just wondering how you thought about that expense piece there and a bit more color on margins?\nSam Samad: Yes. Thank you, Patrick. So listen, we made a lot of great progress in 2023 in terms of expanding our margins and offsetting the COVID headwind that we saw in '23. In terms of '24 expectations, as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, we're looking to expand margins, to continue to expand margins in '24. With, again, the key drivers of that are going to be volume growth, the expectation of volume growth that we have in the plan, that's going to be the biggest impact in terms of driving margins. We're going to be looking at continuing the great work that we're doing on Invigorate and offsetting any cost headwinds. We're assuming the labor inflation to be in line with what we saw in 2023. So somewhere in that 3% to 4% growth range, not necessarily expecting it to get worse, but not necessarily expecting it to get better either. In terms of your question on PAMA, Patrick, you're absolutely right. It's not a positive. It's the absence of a negative. So essentially, the delay gives us certainty now for '24 that we're not going to see a decline. And had PAMA occurred or had PAMA come back in 2024, you're right in the sense that we would have had to potentially defer certain investments. We would have had to make some potentially difficult cuts to offset some of that impact. And the fact that we have a delay affords us the ability now to make certain investments and to avoid some of those difficult cuts that I referenced. But I think the key punchline for 2024 is that we continue to expand operating margins. Jim, you wanted to make a comment.\nJim Davis: Yes. So Patrick, you heard me discuss in our prepared remarks. We're going to continue to invest in our Alzheimer's portfolio of tests. There's still one important blood-based biomarker that we will bring up later this year. And that will complete our investments in our Alzheimer's testing from a blood-based standpoint. You heard me mention that PFAS testing. We're bringing that test up. We'll be launching that here in the first quarter. We have gotten significant consumer and physician demand to bring that test up. And then finally, we're upgrading some of our laboratory information systems in a couple of our esoteric labs. And so, the lack of this PAMA cut gives us the ability to continue to make those investments.\nOperator: The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.\nElizabeth Anderson: I have a sort of unrelated two-part combo one. One, can you talk about sort of the progress you're making on Haystack? I know sort of you ended up sort of on the higher end of the dilution. Is that because you're sort of accelerating test pushout, didn't have seen incremental progress on that side? And then secondarily, can you remind us on your thoughts about share repo for the year? I know that's not in your current base guidance assumptions, but just wanted to hear your updated thoughts on that for capital deployment.\nJim Davis : Okay. Let me address the progress on Haystack, Sam will take the second question. So Haystack is proceeding as we expected. There's no incremental investment versus what we thought. We said last year, $0.15 to $0.20 for the half year. And then likewise, $0.15 to $0.20 incremental this year. We are bringing the assay up in our Lewisville, Texas Cancer Center of Excellence. It's proceeding as we expected. We announced -- you heard in my prepared remarks, discussions of three clinical trials. So we are doing testing right this moment. Obviously, we're not getting paid for that testing as we continue to validate the assay. But we expect to have it launched here in the first half of the year for commercial purposes.\nSam Samad: Yes. And I'll take the second question, Elizabeth. Just to be clear, the Haystack dilution in 2023 was in line with our expectations. It was $0.15 to $0.20. That's what we had called and that's where it came in, in that range of $0.15 to $0.20. With regards to share repo, so we did $275 million of share repo in Q4. Our current expectations are to basically offset equity dilution -- sorry, I said in '24, it's '23 in Q4. And our expectations are to offset equity dilution in '24. And that would work out to something in the similar range that we did in Q4. So somewhere around $250 million to $275 million. That's the base assumption, which is to offset equity dilution.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: There are a lot of moving pieces in the 2024 bridge you provided. If we look at operating margins, excluding Haystack dilution, how are operating margins in 2024 versus 2023? And then 4Q margins missed a street by a decent amount. Can you help us bridge the 4Q margins to what you're guiding to for 2024?\nSam Samad: Sure. Why don't I take that, Pito. So first of all, in terms of operating margin for 2024, what's implied in the guide at the midpoint is expansion of operating margins. We're not calling out specifically what the operating margin rate. But there's definitely growth in terms of the operating margin rate and operating margin dollars in '24 versus '23 where we came in. And that's what's implied in the guide that we gave. With regards to the moving parts around Q4 and then how you bridge that into 2024, listen, there were three things that really impacted us in Q4 from an operating margin rate perspective. We came in at 14.8%. It was still growth year-over-year, significant growth year-over-year despite a significant drop in COVID revenues. But in terms of versus expectations, yes, we missed in terms of operating margin for three key reasons. Number one was employee health care costs. So I would weigh these three reasons, by the way, equally, so one-third, one-third, one-third. But basically, employee health care cost was one-third of that miss. They came in higher than expected in Q4, and we can talk a little bit about what we're doing in '24 with regards to that. Additional -- some additional investments that we made towards the end of the year and some higher costs that we made not necessarily related to labor costs, but some investments that we made targeted investments in Q4, namely IT. So that was one-third of the miss as well. And then one-third was deferred compensation expense, which came in higher. Now remember, that's not an EPS impact. That's an operating margin impact that gets offset on the non-operating expense line. but that impacted our margins again to the tune of one-third of that miss versus our expectations. Now if you look towards '24, the employee health care costs, I mean, we've factored that into our guide. We've also taken steps to lower employee health care costs by -- I mean, we had frozen for the last three years, the employee contribution part of our employee health care cost plans. And we're having now to pass some of that on back to employees in 2024 because we had, as I said, frozen them over the last few years, even with the significant inflation that you've seen in terms of health care. So that's already assumed in 2024. As I mentioned to Patrick, what's assumed is also volume growth that's going to help us grow margins. The deferred compensation, that's just noise. We don't really budget for that. If there's a headwind or a tailwind in '24, that just gets offset on the non-operating line and it shows up as neutral in EPS. And then as I said, we made some additional investments in Q4 to position the business for 2024, and that's factored into the guide in terms of any additional investments that we make in '24. So we feel confident about our growth in terms of operating margins next -- this year.\nJim Davis: Yes. Pito, let me just go back to Q4 just to talk about the progress we made year-over-year. So as Sam indicated, our revenue in Q4 versus '22 was down $45 million. And if you look at the mix of that revenue, COVID was down $145 million year-over-year. And remember, we were getting paid $100, a record at that point. Our base business offset $100 million of that, which is why we were down $45 million. Despite that, bad mix and the lower revenue, we still improved our operating margin by 60 basis points. So we made significant progress in the quarter and that progress will continue as we march into 2024.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. Jim, I was hoping to hear from you, like what are you assuming in terms of core utilization in terms of the guide? You've had elevated rates the last couple of years coming out of the pandemic. Do you think that can sustain? Or are you seeing moderation in any areas?\nJim Davis: Yes. So for the fourth quarter, Jack, we saw volume growth of 5.1%. For the total year, we had volume growth of 6.5%. Now, I would tell you at the very beginning portion of this year, the first two to three weeks with the weather that we saw across the U.S., volume growth was stunted a bit. But in the last week or so, we\u2019ve seen volume recover to the normal rates and expectations that we have for the year. So you\u2019ve heard several of the health plans have reported higher utilization in the fourth quarter. We, ourselves, because of our own health care costs, we know there was higher utilization of our own employees. So we expect it to continue at slightly above the normal market rates, albeit the first month of the year has been tempered a little bit by weather.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Maybe, Sam, as I think about all the comments from Jim on how it looks like the revenue outlook is good, right? You have all these tailwinds potentially going forward with new tests and whatnot. Help us bridge to getting back to that EPS or earnings growth in the long-term outlook that you've provided? Because obviously, '24 is an aberration. Are there some one-timers here? But how do you guys comfortable in that long-term earnings growth, '25 going forward?\nSam Samad: Yes. Thanks, Brian. So first of all, let me say definitively that we are absolutely still confident about our long-term growth guide that we gave, which is essentially to grow revenues in the mid-single digits to grow EPS in the high single-digits. So long-term growth is unchanged. As you yourself mentioned, there are some headwinds in 2024 that I think are transient or temporary that we see this year. So we've got a COVID revenue decline, which is approximately $175 million or roughly $0.50 year-over-year. You've got -- and we've called this before, but you've got Haystack dilution, which is now full year dilution versus a half year dilution that we saw in '23. And then you've got interest expense, which is to the tune of about $0.25, which is really as a result of the additional debt that we took on and the higher borrowing costs driven by the macro environment that we\u2019re in. But that\u2019s really to fund acquisitions and to fund growth in the business as well in the base business. We\u2019ve got a strong pipeline, and we feel really confident about the M&A landscape and the M&A opportunities ahead of us. And we upsized the issuance in November to basically partly pay for the acquisitions that we made in \u201823, Haystack and to some extent, NewYork-Presbyterian, but also to fund the future acquisitions, some of which are not included in this guide. So I would say the punchline is we\u2019re definitely still confident about the long-term growth of the business and the EPS guide that we gave.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS.\nAndrea Alfonso: It's Andrea Alfonso in for Kevin. Unfortunately, I'm in the enviable position of asking yet another question around margin expectations. But I guess my question is, when we think about just the expansion of margins you expect and thinking about the puts and takes into next year. I guess I want to isolate like what gets better? I know that there's maybe some assumption in there around the M&A you've absorbed so far? Is that mildly accretive or just sort of in line or maybe below the margin. Some of your -- in one of your slides, I think there was some mention of GAAP charges around workforce reductions, et cetera. Is that sort of just lingering on from 2023 or is that a new tranche? Just trying to get an understanding on those two items.\nSam Samad: Yes. So thank you for the question. With regards to margin expansion, I mean as I mentioned earlier, a big factor is going to be driven by volume growth that we see in 2024. That's really the key factor. We're going to continue to invigorate actions that we have talked about to the tune of 3% cost reduction across our entire cost base. And that's -- we actually met that target in '23, we slightly exceeded it. And in '24, it's going to be continuing with those initiatives. With regards to any workforce reductions, there aren't any workforce reductions planned right now. Usually, when we have -- when you look at that GAAP to non-GAAP, we just have a placeholder for potential workforce reductions there or potential restructuring charges. But there isn't anything that's related specifically to any headcount cuts. Now we do have the cost reductions in '24 that we continue to see. So in Q1, for instance, we have some benefit from some cost reductions that we didn't see in Q1 of last year, but then we'll continue to be very disciplined about our P&L as we go forward in '24. Yes, so that's really the key driver in terms of our margin growth.\nOperator: The next question will come from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Ms. Gill, please check the mute button on your phone.\nLisa Gill: You talked a lot about volume growth this morning, but I'm just curious on the price side. So if I go back to the last couple of quarters, you talked about stabilizing pricing with health plans. You talked earlier about health plan leakage and the opportunity there. So maybe can you put those two pieces together for us as we think about the growth for next year of how much is volume and how much of that is on the price side?\nJim Davis: Yes. So let me just recap '23 and then we'll get into '24. So in 2023, price, pure price, price per test provided us a slight lift year-over-year, okay? So our base rev per req that we've reported was up 1.2% and price was a positive contributor towards that. Now going into 2024, we expect, again, price to be flat to slightly up for the year. We concluded all of the significant health plan renegotiations in '23. Obviously, there's a new tranche that always comes about one-third -- 25% to 33% renew every year. But we feel confident that prices will remain flat to slightly up as we enter 2024.\nOperator: The next question will come from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America.\nDerik de Bruin: So changing track a little. Look, the LDT legislation looks like it's making more progress than it has. It's like -- can you quantify what your exposure is to LDTs and sort of your thought process here? I mean, you're introducing a bunch of new tests would qualify for that. So how do you think about incremental investments if that goes through? And would you discontinue to test there? And then as a follow-up, there's been some legal movement lately on the MRD space. There's been some litigation that's happened that has blocked some other players from the market. Does Haystack have freedom to operate as you sort of look at what's changed in the IP landscape on that? And how do you think about your IP portfolio on Haystack and being able to not get sued?\nJim Davis: Yes. So let me address your second question first. We have no risk with respect to the IP on the underlying technology that we're using in Haystack. We feel very confident about it. Much of that IP comes out of John Hopkins University, and we're solid there. So no risk. In terms of LDTs, I think we've said in the past about 10% of our tests are considered LDTs. We'll wait to hear from the FDA in April what the final rule is, and then we'll make decisions as an industry from there. What I would tell you is that we do a significant amount of work for the pharmaceutical industry today, and we do a significant amount of work for four international laboratories. Both of those require us to be ISO certified. And when you're doing work for the pharmaceutical industry, especially for companion diagnostics, you're essentially operating already under FDA regulation. So it's not going to be anything radical that we don't know what we need to do. Will there be further investments and steps required to get all of our laboratories that do LDTs accredited? Yes, there will be. But it\u2019s not a heavy lift for Quest Diagnostics.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair.\nAndrew Brackmann : I want to go back to the Alzheimer's offerings and the investments that you're making there. Can you maybe just sort of talk at a high level about the opportunity that you see for that category? Should we sort of think about this market kind of ultimately looking at something like oncology where you have screening therapy selection monitoring et cetera? Or does it sort of take a different path for you guys?\nJim Davis: Yes. So thanks for the question. It's a great question. So first, I would say that there's just broader awareness of testing options that are now available to both consumers and to physicians. In part, this is because of new therapeutics that have been introduced has just created widespread awareness. As you know, the majority of testing today for Alzheimer's is conducted via PET-CT, which are expensive $2,500 to $4,000 exams or CSF testing, cerebral spinal fluid, which is not an expensive lab test. However, the procedure to extract CFS out of the human body is an expensive procedure. And likewise, the total cost of that is roughly $1,000. We have brought up blood-based assays for ApoE, which is a genetic risk for Alzheimer's. We brought up a blood-based assay for what we call AB42/40, which is generally considered the earliest indicator amyloid plaque, the earliest indicator of dementia and/or Alzheimer's onset. And then we brought up one of the two protein markers that are also involved, the Tau markers. We brought up 181 and there's a second one 217 that we will be bringing up later this year. That, in essence, completes our blood-based offering. And I think there's widespread consumer interest, widespread interest amongst primary care physicians. And we've had double-digit growth all year long in both our blood-based assays and CSF testing, and we expect that double-digit growth to continue on in 2024 and beyond.\nOperator: The next question will come from Stephanie Davis of Barclays.\nStephanie Davis: So I was hoping to dig in a little bit more on to the AI question you're having and discussions around the prepared remarks. Could you tell me just a little bit more about what you'll be investing into and how maybe the rollout of things of the AI job, the AI job helper will help you guys out? And then I guess on a follow-up to that one, is it safe to assume that you'll have more IT investments as you develop some of these AI solutions that will then have more out year yield for your margin opportunity?\nJim Davis: Yes. So good question. The AI tool that we referred to with respect to our Clifton lab, is really -- it was a tool that we used to analyze the workflow within several departments in the Clifton Laboratory, that actually looked at from fairly simple things like steps and movement between equipment, loading and unloading of certain racks and we reviewed it and you find some really quick easy simplification efforts to adjust equipment, move equipment to minimize the human content or labor involved in each one of these steps. More broadly, we've deployed AI in two critical areas. One is in microbiology. Microbiology, as you know, you grow things in a dish, you look at it under a microscope. But with one of our partners, we now -- we can take digital images of what's growing in the dish and the system actually reviews those images and makes the initial call of a negative or positive. We still review the positives by high, but it's a digital image as opposed to doing it under a microscope. But it's a much quicker read because the system has generally indicated -- this system is already indicated if it is positive. We're also in the process of deploying artificial intelligence and digitizing pathology. So as you know, pathology is generally read under a microscope. We're in the process of implementing digital systems that allow for one to read off of a monitor versus under a microscope. And once you\u2019ve digitized that slide, you\u2019re now able to apply algorithms to, again, at least help with what we call region of interest, pointing out to the pathologist where they should look and inevitably helping the pathologists make the proper diagnosis.\nOperator: And the last question for today's call will come from Eric Coldwell of Baird.\nEric Coldwell: I have actually going to have a couple here. First, the -- I missed this. What was the M&A contribution to revenue growth in 2024 guidance?\nSam Samad: So it's about 50 basis points right now is what's in the guide, Eric. And it really reflects, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the carryover that we have from the acquisitions that we did in '23, which is really NewYork-Presbyterian, The Steward Health Care, the Lenco acquisition that we signed. And really, that's it.\nEric Coldwell: So if I take mid-point revenue guidance at $1.6 million, remove the COVID headwind, you get to about 3.5% on the base and then take out 50 bps from M&A, you're at 3% organic on the base.\nSam Samad: Yes, that's correct.\nEric Coldwell: Okay. Second question, a higher mix of hospital reference testing, it sounds like. You talked about trends in hospital reference being above plan being above long-term history. What kind of an impact does that have on gross margin in the quarter?\nJim Davis: Yes. So in general, our reference testing, which is more LDT like than it is the routine testing, as you know, Eric. In general, that carries a higher test margin, higher gross margin. And in general, right, we're not drawing specimens that are derived or taken in hospitals. So there's a very little phlebotomy cost involved in reference work. So generally, the operating margin of our hospital-based tests are going to be higher than the average of the business. So that business did grow at a faster rate than our overall book of business, both in Q4 as well as for the total year. So it was good mix.\nOperator: And that was our final question for today.\nJim Davis: All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call, and we look forward to further updates through the year. Everyone, have a great day.\nOperator: A replay of the call may be accessed online at www.questdiagnostics.com/investor or by phone at 203-369-3391 for International Callers or 800-934-9421 for domestic callers.

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.29 billion, down 1.9% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 4.7% to $2.25 billion. While COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 80% to $37 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 2% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 5.2% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition declined 3.5% versus the prior year driven primarily by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec was up 0.2%. Unit price reimbursement was positive and consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the fourth quarter was $267 million or 11.7% of revenues compared to $135 million or 5.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $338 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $330 million or 14.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income is related primarily to growth in the base business, actions taken in 2023 to reduce support costs and lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases, higher employee health care costs and higher deferred compensation expense. Reported EPS was $1.70 in the quarter compared to $0.87 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.15 compared to $1.98 last year. Cash from operations was $1.27 billion for full-year 2023 versus $1.72 billion in the prior year, driven primarily by lower COVID-19 testing revenue. Finally, our Board of Directors has authorized a 5.6% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.71 to $0.75 per share or $3 per share annually effective with the dividend payable in April 2024. The company has raised its dividend annually since 2011. Turning to our full-year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.35 billion and $9.45 billion. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.69 to $7.99 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.60 to $8.90. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. We have posted a presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website that includes an adjusted earnings bridge, which shows some of the key elements to bridge from our 2023 adjusted EPS to the 2024 adjusted EPS guidance we shared today. Our 2024 guidance reflects the following consideration. We are no longer providing detailed base business and COVID revenue guidance. However, note that we are assuming that COVID revenues will decline at least $175 million in 2024, which will partially offset the growth we expect from the base business. Most of the COVID headwind in 2024 will occur during the first quarter as we generated $119 million of COVID revenue in Q1 last year. In terms of M&A, our guidance only contemplates acquisitions that have been announced or closed to date, including the outreach acquisitions from NewYork-Presbyterian and Stewart Health Care, as well as Lenco, the independent lab Jim mentioned earlier. We will absorb the full year of dilution from our acquisition of Haystack Oncology with an increment impact of approximately $0.20 to adjusted EPS in 2024. We made strong progress improving our base business operating margins in 2023 and expect margin expansion in 2024. We anticipate net interest expense to increase to approximately $190 million in 2024 as a result of higher borrowings following our debt issuance in November. We assume a roughly flat share count compared to the end of 2023. We are expecting adjusted EPS in Q1 to be roughly 21% of our full year earnings. This is slightly below the typical seasonality and reflects the significant amount of weather disruption we've experienced in January. At this point, we anticipate a weather headwind of $0.05 to $0.07 in Q1. And finally, as Jim mentioned earlier, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. With that, I'll now turn it back to Jim. Yes. Thank you, Patrick. So listen, we made a lot of great progress in 2023 in terms of expanding our margins and offsetting the COVID headwind that we saw in '23. In terms of '24 expectations, as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, we're looking to expand margins, to continue to expand margins in '24. With, again, the key drivers of that are going to be volume growth, the expectation of volume growth that we have in the plan, that's going to be the biggest impact in terms of driving margins. We're going to be looking at continuing the great work that we're doing on Invigorate and offsetting any cost headwinds. We're assuming the labor inflation to be in line with what we saw in 2023. So somewhere in that 3% to 4% growth range, not necessarily expecting it to get worse, but not necessarily expecting it to get better either. In terms of your question on PAMA, Patrick, you're absolutely right. It's not a positive. It's the absence of a negative. So essentially, the delay gives us certainty now for '24 that we're not going to see a decline. And had PAMA occurred or had PAMA come back in 2024, you're right in the sense that we would have had to potentially defer certain investments. We would have had to make some potentially difficult cuts to offset some of that impact. And the fact that we have a delay affords us the ability now to make certain investments and to avoid some of those difficult cuts that I referenced. But I think the key punchline for 2024 is that we continue to expand operating margins. Jim, you wanted to make a comment. Yes. And I'll take the second question, Elizabeth. Just to be clear, the Haystack dilution in 2023 was in line with our expectations. It was $0.15 to $0.20. That's what we had called and that's where it came in, in that range of $0.15 to $0.20. With regards to share repo, so we did $275 million of share repo in Q4. Our current expectations are to basically offset equity dilution -- sorry, I said in '24, it's '23 in Q4. And our expectations are to offset equity dilution in '24. And that would work out to something in the similar range that we did in Q4. So somewhere around $250 million to $275 million. That's the base assumption, which is to offset equity dilution. Sure. Why don't I take that, Pito. So first of all, in terms of operating margin for 2024, what's implied in the guide at the midpoint is expansion of operating margins. We're not calling out specifically what the operating margin rate. But there's definitely growth in terms of the operating margin rate and operating margin dollars in '24 versus '23 where we came in. And that's what's implied in the guide that we gave. With regards to the moving parts around Q4 and then how you bridge that into 2024, listen, there were three things that really impacted us in Q4 from an operating margin rate perspective. We came in at 14.8%. It was still growth year-over-year, significant growth year-over-year despite a significant drop in COVID revenues. But in terms of versus expectations, yes, we missed in terms of operating margin for three key reasons. Number one was employee health care costs. So I would weigh these three reasons, by the way, equally, so one-third, one-third, one-third. But basically, employee health care cost was one-third of that miss. They came in higher than expected in Q4, and we can talk a little bit about what we're doing in '24 with regards to that. Additional -- some additional investments that we made towards the end of the year and some higher costs that we made not necessarily related to labor costs, but some investments that we made targeted investments in Q4, namely IT. So that was one-third of the miss as well. And then one-third was deferred compensation expense, which came in higher. Now remember, that's not an EPS impact. That's an operating margin impact that gets offset on the non-operating expense line. but that impacted our margins again to the tune of one-third of that miss versus our expectations. Now if you look towards '24, the employee health care costs, I mean, we've factored that into our guide. We've also taken steps to lower employee health care costs by -- I mean, we had frozen for the last three years, the employee contribution part of our employee health care cost plans. And we're having now to pass some of that on back to employees in 2024 because we had, as I said, frozen them over the last few years, even with the significant inflation that you've seen in terms of health care. So that's already assumed in 2024. As I mentioned to Patrick, what's assumed is also volume growth that's going to help us grow margins. The deferred compensation, that's just noise. We don't really budget for that. If there's a headwind or a tailwind in '24, that just gets offset on the non-operating line and it shows up as neutral in EPS. And then as I said, we made some additional investments in Q4 to position the business for 2024, and that's factored into the guide in terms of any additional investments that we make in '24. So we feel confident about our growth in terms of operating margins next -- this year. Yes. Thanks, Brian. So first of all, let me say definitively that we are absolutely still confident about our long-term growth guide that we gave, which is essentially to grow revenues in the mid-single digits to grow EPS in the high single-digits. So long-term growth is unchanged. As you yourself mentioned, there are some headwinds in 2024 that I think are transient or temporary that we see this year. So we've got a COVID revenue decline, which is approximately $175 million or roughly $0.50 year-over-year. You've got -- and we've called this before, but you've got Haystack dilution, which is now full year dilution versus a half year dilution that we saw in '23. And then you've got interest expense, which is to the tune of about $0.25, which is really as a result of the additional debt that we took on and the higher borrowing costs driven by the macro environment that we're in. But that's really to fund acquisitions and to fund growth in the business as well in the base business. We've got a strong pipeline, and we feel really confident about the M&A landscape and the M&A opportunities ahead of us. And we upsized the issuance in November to basically partly pay for the acquisitions that we made in \u201823, Haystack and to some extent, NewYork-Presbyterian, but also to fund the future acquisitions, some of which are not included in this guide. So I would say the punchline is we're definitely still confident about the long-term growth of the business and the EPS guide that we gave. Yes. So thank you for the question. With regards to margin expansion, I mean as I mentioned earlier, a big factor is going to be driven by volume growth that we see in 2024. That's really the key factor. We're going to continue to invigorate actions that we have talked about to the tune of 3% cost reduction across our entire cost base. And that's -- we actually met that target in '23, we slightly exceeded it. And in '24, it's going to be continuing with those initiatives. With regards to any workforce reductions, there aren't any workforce reductions planned right now. Usually, when we have -- when you look at that GAAP to non-GAAP, we just have a placeholder for potential workforce reductions there or potential restructuring charges. But there isn't anything that's related specifically to any headcount cuts. Now we do have the cost reductions in '24 that we continue to see. So in Q1, for instance, we have some benefit from some cost reductions that we didn't see in Q1 of last year, but then we'll continue to be very disciplined about our P&L as we go forward in '24. Yes, so that's really the key driver in terms of our margin growth. So it's about 50 basis points right now is what's in the guide, Eric. And it really reflects, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the carryover that we have from the acquisitions that we did in '23, which is really NewYork-Presbyterian, The Steward Health Care, the Lenco acquisition that we signed. And really, that's it. Yes, that's correct."

            "name": "Jim Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. For the full-year 2023, we delivered strong revenue growth of 7% in our base business and delivered on our earnings commitment as we transitioned away from COVID testing. The results we announced this morning reflect a strong fourth quarter and full year for our base business, in which we made substantial progress on our strategy to drive top-line growth across our core customer channels and improve profitability. Throughout the year, we advanced our growth strategy with innovative testing solutions, new and expanded relationships with health systems and a robust pipeline of M&A and professional lab services opportunities. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in several clinical areas, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology. We also strengthened our oncology offering with a strategic investment in higher growth, minimal residual disease testing. In addition, our efforts to improve quality and productivity delivered our invigorate goal, which helped us to offset the cost headwinds we faced throughout the year. This morning, we issued guidance for 2024 that reflects a return to overall revenue growth, while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well-positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues for making this happen. Every day, they bring our purpose to life, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. Before discussing highlights from 2023, I'd like to share some recent regulatory updates. First, as you know, Congress once again delayed Medicare reimbursement cuts and the next data collection process under PAMA that were scheduled to take place in 2024. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to work closely with our trade association to seek a permanent fix to PAMA through SALSA, the saving access to Laboratory Services Act. ACLA's highest priority this year is to secure passage of SALSA. Second, ACLA and nearly 7,000 other individuals and groups submitted comments last quarter on a rule proposed by the FDA to regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. Lab-developed tests are essential medical innovations that are already highly regulated under federal legislation known as CLIA. In addition to the oversight by states, accredited bodies and Medicare as it makes coverage determinations. If enacted, the FDA's proposed rule would compromise patient access to a central lab testing. It would also slow diagnostic innovation and add unnecessary health care costs. We agree with ACLA that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate LDTs and believe that resuming discussions with the FDA, Congress, ACLA and other stakeholders on a legislative solution is the most prudent path forward. Now I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the fourth quarter. Then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers: physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency, workforce experience and service. Here are some updates on the progress we have made in these areas in the fourth quarter. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered mid-single-digit base business revenue growth. We attribute this growth to return to care, overall market growth and share gains driven by the competitive strengths of our scale and innovative offerings. We continue to execute hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions, which generate volume for our physician channel. In January, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire select assets of Lenco, an independent New York-based laboratory company and expect to complete the transaction later this quarter. In addition, we acquired outreach assets of Steward Health Care, which will deepen our reach to patients in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio. As we said earlier, our acquisition pipeline is very strong, and we expect to complete additional transactions in 2024. Our strong relationships with health plans were also a key driver of growth in 2023 as we grew revenues from health plans by high single-digits versus the prior year. As we've indicated, we successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled in 2023. Health plans and self-insured employer clients recognize the clinical and economic value we deliver to them and their members. To date, more than half of health plan revenues now come from value-based contracts, which enable faster growth compared to our traditional health plan contracts. In addition, working with health plans, we continue to reduce so-called lab leakage to high-cost out-of-network labs, partly by redirecting the volume to Quest. Importantly, this is good for both patients as well as employers, which pay for the majority of health care costs. In hospital lab services, we drove high single-digit base business revenue growth in the fourth quarter with strength in both reference and professional laboratory services. Hospital reference testing, in particular, grew much faster than historical trends and well above our estimated growth for the market. Increasingly, health systems recognize that our innovative laboratory testing and collaborative lab management solutions can help them improve quality, productivity, affordability and care. They also continue to face labor and cost pressures prompting more of them to reach out to us to help with their lab strategy. Our professional lab services help manage a hospital's lab, supply chain and workforce. We also provide insights from our analytical solutions to help hospitals manage utilization to deliver the right test to the right patient at the right time. In the fourth quarter, we completed two PLS relationships that will contribute modest growth in the first quarter of this year. We also provide health systems the opportunity to transition their non-core outreach laboratory assets to us through acquisitions. By selling their outreach assets to Quest, these hospitals are better able to redeploy scarce capital to areas of their business that have a greater impact on patient care. Our consumer-initiated testing service, questhealth.com, generated revenues of approximately $45 million in the full year 2023, with strong base business growth. Our return on ad spend and customer acquisition costs remained favorable in the fourth quarter. Another element of our CIT strategy is to drive revenue growth through channel partners. In 2023, we generated more than $30 million through this channel. We are also excited about new product releases in 2024, including blood testing for PFAS or forever chemicals via questhealth.com. PFAS chemicals have been used in industrial and consumer products for decades and may contaminate food and water. In late January, the CDC issued new guidelines that recognize the value of PFAS blood testing for individuals that may have elevated exposure levels, which may increase risk of kidney cancer, eye cholesterol and other health conditions. According to a study in the Journal of Endocrine Society, PFAS chemicals accounted for approximately $22 billion in U.S. health care costs in 2018. In Advanced diagnostics, we experienced double-digit growth across several clinical areas in the fourth quarter, including advanced cardiometabolic, prenatal and hereditary genetics and neurology. Growth in neurology was driven largely by our Alzheimer's disease portfolio of tests, which is among the most comprehensive in the fast-evolving field of Alzheimer's care. Our innovations include our AV detect blood test for early risk assessment based on amyloid beta proteins and Apo lead genetic risk. This week, we also added P-Tau181 to our AV detect blood test line to complement insights from amyloid beta testing. In addition, our Alzheimer's disease test portfolio includes several CSF tests for diagnosis and monitoring based on amyloid beta, P-Tau181 and Apo lead. We intend to add additional biomarkers later this year and continue to expand our menu. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are on track to launch our Haystack minimal residual disease test to physicians later this year from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas. We also believe Haystack MRD can help support clinical research and recently announced clinical trial collaborations using this innovative technology with the Rutgers Cancer Institute, Alliance Foundation trials in TriSalus Life Sciences. In the fourth quarter, we announced a collaboration with Universal DX, which has developed an innovative blood test for screening for colorectal cancer, including precancerous lesions. We look forward to supporting Universal's effort to gain regulatory approval for this test. Through our collaboration with Scipher, we are expanding patient access to the PRISM-RA test for aiding treatment selection for rheumatoid arthritis. Turning to operational excellence. Our Invigorate program delivered our targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. Here are three examples of how we're improving operations. First, we continue to make progress in using front-end automation to enhance specimen processing. In 2023, we completed front-end automation upgrades in our Pittsburgh and Dallas laboratories, which will improve quality and productivity. This year, we'll add five additional sites. Second, we also expanded the use of AI to improve quality, efficiency and workforce experience in several clinical areas. AI can quickly identify patterns that signify possible disease and digital images of patient cultures and slides. In 2023, we expanded the use of AI in microbiology to help identify bacteria as well as in cytogenetics to identify chromosomal abnormalities. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the opportunities to use AI in several additional clinical areas including cytology, pathology and parasitology. Third, in 2023, we deployed an AI tool at our Clifton lab that helps laboratory staff continuously identify ways to be more productive in their daily routines. And we look forward to introducing this AI job helper in other labs and support processes. Finally, we made significant progress improving the margins of our base business in 2023. I'd like to personally thank our Quest colleagues whose efforts have helped make this possible. With that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam? Thanks, Sam. Finally, I'd like to take a moment to remember Dr. Paul A. Brown, who passed away in January of this year. In 1967, Dr. Brown founded MetPath, the predecessor company of Quest Diagnostics, providing basic lab services from his apartment in New York City. Dr. Brown was a pioneer who invented the blueprint for our industry that today is recognized as essential to quality health care, and we are grateful for his vision and leadership. To summarize, we delivered strong base business revenue growth in 2023 and achieved our EPS commitments. Our guidance in 2024 reflects a return to total revenue growth while balancing the earnings tailwinds and headwinds we see for the year. Looking beyond 2024, we are well positioned to deliver our long-term financial outlook to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit earnings growth. And I'm grateful to our dedicated Quest colleagues who bring our purpose to life every single day, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Yes. So Patrick, you heard me discuss in our prepared remarks. We're going to continue to invest in our Alzheimer's portfolio of tests. There's still one important blood-based biomarker that we will bring up later this year. And that will complete our investments in our Alzheimer's testing from a blood-based standpoint. You heard me mention that PFAS testing. We're bringing that test up. We'll be launching that here in the first quarter. We have gotten significant consumer and physician demand to bring that test up. And then finally, we're upgrading some of our laboratory information systems in a couple of our esoteric labs. And so, the lack of this PAMA cut gives us the ability to continue to make those investments. Okay. Let me address the progress on Haystack, Sam will take the second question. So Haystack is proceeding as we expected. There's no incremental investment versus what we thought. We said last year, $0.15 to $0.20 for the half year. And then likewise, $0.15 to $0.20 incremental this year. We are bringing the assay up in our Lewisville, Texas Cancer Center of Excellence. It's proceeding as we expected. We announced -- you heard in my prepared remarks, discussions of three clinical trials. So we are doing testing right this moment. Obviously, we're not getting paid for that testing as we continue to validate the assay. But we expect to have it launched here in the first half of the year for commercial purposes. Yes. Pito, let me just go back to Q4 just to talk about the progress we made year-over-year. So as Sam indicated, our revenue in Q4 versus '22 was down $45 million. And if you look at the mix of that revenue, COVID was down $145 million year-over-year. And remember, we were getting paid $100, a record at that point. Our base business offset $100 million of that, which is why we were down $45 million. Despite that, bad mix and the lower revenue, we still improved our operating margin by 60 basis points. So we made significant progress in the quarter and that progress will continue as we march into 2024. Yes. So for the fourth quarter, Jack, we saw volume growth of 5.1%. For the total year, we had volume growth of 6.5%. Now, I would tell you at the very beginning portion of this year, the first two to three weeks with the weather that we saw across the U.S., volume growth was stunted a bit. But in the last week or so, we've seen volume recover to the normal rates and expectations that we have for the year. So you've heard several of the health plans have reported higher utilization in the fourth quarter. We, ourselves, because of our own health care costs, we know there was higher utilization of our own employees. So we expect it to continue at slightly above the normal market rates, albeit the first month of the year has been tempered a little bit by weather. Yes. So let me just recap '23 and then we'll get into '24. So in 2023, price, pure price, price per test provided us a slight lift year-over-year, okay? So our base rev per req that we've reported was up 1.2% and price was a positive contributor towards that. Now going into 2024, we expect, again, price to be flat to slightly up for the year. We concluded all of the significant health plan renegotiations in '23. Obviously, there's a new tranche that always comes about one-third -- 25% to 33% renew every year. But we feel confident that prices will remain flat to slightly up as we enter 2024. Yes. So let me address your second question first. We have no risk with respect to the IP on the underlying technology that we're using in Haystack. We feel very confident about it. Much of that IP comes out of John Hopkins University, and we're solid there. So no risk. In terms of LDTs, I think we've said in the past about 10% of our tests are considered LDTs. We'll wait to hear from the FDA in April what the final rule is, and then we'll make decisions as an industry from there. What I would tell you is that we do a significant amount of work for the pharmaceutical industry today, and we do a significant amount of work for four international laboratories. Both of those require us to be ISO certified. And when you're doing work for the pharmaceutical industry, especially for companion diagnostics, you're essentially operating already under FDA regulation. So it's not going to be anything radical that we don't know what we need to do. Will there be further investments and steps required to get all of our laboratories that do LDTs accredited? Yes, there will be. But it's not a heavy lift for Quest Diagnostics. Yes. So thanks for the question. It's a great question. So first, I would say that there's just broader awareness of testing options that are now available to both consumers and to physicians. In part, this is because of new therapeutics that have been introduced has just created widespread awareness. As you know, the majority of testing today for Alzheimer's is conducted via PET-CT, which are expensive $2,500 to $4,000 exams or CSF testing, cerebral spinal fluid, which is not an expensive lab test. However, the procedure to extract CFS out of the human body is an expensive procedure. And likewise, the total cost of that is roughly $1,000. We have brought up blood-based assays for ApoE, which is a genetic risk for Alzheimer's. We brought up a blood-based assay for what we call AB42/40, which is generally considered the earliest indicator amyloid plaque, the earliest indicator of dementia and/or Alzheimer's onset. And then we brought up one of the two protein markers that are also involved, the Tau markers. We brought up 181 and there's a second one 217 that we will be bringing up later this year. That, in essence, completes our blood-based offering. And I think there's widespread consumer interest, widespread interest amongst primary care physicians. And we've had double-digit growth all year long in both our blood-based assays and CSF testing, and we expect that double-digit growth to continue on in 2024 and beyond. Yes. So good question. The AI tool that we referred to with respect to our Clifton lab, is really -- it was a tool that we used to analyze the workflow within several departments in the Clifton Laboratory, that actually looked at from fairly simple things like steps and movement between equipment, loading and unloading of certain racks and we reviewed it and you find some really quick easy simplification efforts to adjust equipment, move equipment to minimize the human content or labor involved in each one of these steps. More broadly, we've deployed AI in two critical areas. One is in microbiology. Microbiology, as you know, you grow things in a dish, you look at it under a microscope. But with one of our partners, we now -- we can take digital images of what's growing in the dish and the system actually reviews those images and makes the initial call of a negative or positive. We still review the positives by high, but it's a digital image as opposed to doing it under a microscope. But it's a much quicker read because the system has generally indicated -- this system is already indicated if it is positive. We're also in the process of deploying artificial intelligence and digitizing pathology. So as you know, pathology is generally read under a microscope. We're in the process of implementing digital systems that allow for one to read off of a monitor versus under a microscope. And once you've digitized that slide, you're now able to apply algorithms to, again, at least help with what we call region of interest, pointing out to the pathologist where they should look and inevitably helping the pathologists make the proper diagnosis. Yes. So in general, our reference testing, which is more LDT like than it is the routine testing, as you know, Eric. In general, that carries a higher test margin, higher gross margin. And in general, right, we're not drawing specimens that are derived or taken in hospitals. So there's a very little phlebotomy cost involved in reference work. So generally, the operating margin of our hospital-based tests are going to be higher than the average of the business. So that business did grow at a faster rate than our overall book of business, both in Q4 as well as for the total year. So it was good mix. All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call, and we look forward to further updates through the year. Everyone, have a great day."

Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business.  Now here is Jim Davis.\nJim Davis : Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We grew our base business nearly 5% in the third quarter, largely by driving growth in our physician and hospital channels. Our consumer channel also continued to produce solid base business revenue growth. In addition, we are pleased that we have now successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled for this year. These strength and collaborations will position us to build on growth opportunities going forward our Invigorate program is on track to deliver 3% annual productivity improvements and savings. In addition, the productivity of our base business improved sequentially and year-over-year. Given the strength of our business and a robust pipeline of professional lab services and M&A opportunities, we are well positioned for continued growth. This morning, I'll discuss highlights from the third quarter, then Sam will provide more details on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2023. Now let's turn to some of the highlights from the quarter. Our strategy is to drive growth by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers. We are enabling growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions remain a key driver of our growth with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller independent labs. Finally, our strategy includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service. Here are a few key updates on the progress we have made in these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered mid-single-digit base business revenue growth driven by the strength in our cardiometabolic and general health and wellness testing. Our strong relationships with health plans were also a key driver in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled for this year. Our success is a result of the clinical and economic value we deliver to health plans and their members. Today, more than 50% of the health of the health plan revenues are generated from these value-based contracts, which are fueling double-digit growth compared to our traditional health plan contracts. Together with the health plans, we have a renewed focus on initiatives to reduce leakage to high-cost out-of-network labs. In addition, we are working together to redirect volume from high-cost labs to Quest. Importantly, this is good for both patients and employers which are paying for the majority of health care costs. In hospital lab services, base revenues grew high single digits in the quarter as we saw strength in hospital reference testing and continued progress with our most recent PLS relationships, including Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health. Our hospital strategy is to help health systems improve productivity and patient care by delivering innovative laboratory testing that is high quality, accessible and affordable. We continue to manage a robust pipeline of professional lab services and hospital outreach acquisition opportunities. Health systems continue to face labor and cost pressures, which are prompting more of them to reach out to us for help with their lab strategy and in some cases, monetize their hospital outreach business. Our professional lab services can help manage hospitals labs, supply chain and workforce. We are also providing insights from our analytical solutions to guide hospitals to deliver the right test to the right patient at the right time. In addition, hospital outreach acquisitions enable health systems to focus their expertise and capital on the areas of their business that support patient care and drive growth. In Consumer Health, we generated solid base business revenue growth from our consumer-initiated testing channel in the quarter. In addition, our consumer channel was again profitable this quarter. We attribute the strong performance to continuing demand for our expanded test menu, including STIs, comprehensive health and tuberculosis blood testing. Underpinning each of these key channels, physician, hospital and consumer is our advanced diagnostics. These highly innovative higher-growth test areas include molecular genomics and oncology as well as several other key areas. During the quarter, we grew revenues double digits in multiple clinical areas including neurology, women's and reproductive health, cardiometabolic and infectious disease and immunology. We are particularly encouraged by growth in our Alzheimer's disease portfolio, which features our AD-Detect blood testing services. These innovative services use highly sensitive mass spectrometry technologies to provide insight into Alzheimer's risk based on amyloid proteins and the APOE genetic risk marker. During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our Alzheimer's cerebral spinal fluid panel as well, which helps providers identified levels of both amyloid and tau proteins as well as the APOE status. We also grew significantly in women's and reproductive health, especially in non-invasive prenatal and carrier screening tests. During the quarter, the FDA granted breakthrough designation for our adeno-associated virus called AAV companion diagnostic, which we developed in collaboration with Sarepta Therapeutics for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy. This FDA designation places us at the forefront of AAV test innovation in the growing area of cell and gene therapies and positions us to build collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies. Finally, the integration of Haystack Oncology remains on track. The acquisition positions us to enter the high-growth liquid biopsy area of minimal residual disease or MRD testing. We expect to launch our first MRD test in early 2024 from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas. Now turning to operational and productivity improvement. Our Invigorate program is well on its way to delivering our targeted 3% annual productivity improvements and savings. I'd like to share 3 examples of how we're improving operations. First, we are deploying front-end automation to enhance specimen processing in our Pittsburgh and Dallas laboratories, which will improve quality and productivity. More sites are planned to receive front-end automation during 2024. We are expanding the use of optical character recognition, or OCR, to scan in data from samples coming into our labs. By freeing up specimen processors from this manual data entry, we will improve our productivity of paper-based recs coming into all of our regional labs by 30%. Finally, we continue to optimize our real estate footprint. Post pandemic, we need less space for some of our call center and administrative functions. We've reduced our real estate footprint by nearly 250,000 square feet by consolidating functions into existing spaces. Before I hand it over to Sam, I'd like to offer our perspective on the rule recently proposed by the Food and Drug Administration that would regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. Lab developed tests are essential medical innovations that providers use to guide care for patients every day. These services are highly regulated under federal legislation known as CLIA. In addition to the oversight by states, accredited bodies and Medicare as it makes coverage determinations. If enacted, the FDA's proposed rule would impact patient care by compromising access, slowing diagnostic innovation and adding unnecessary cost to our health care system. We agree with the long-standing assertion of our trade association, ACLA, that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate LDTs under its existing medical device authority. Now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance.\nSam Samad : Quarter consolidated revenues were $2.3 billion, down 7.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 4.6% to $2.27 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 92% to $26 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 7.9% compared to the prior year reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing versus the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by growth in our base business. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined 0.5% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 5.7% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition declined 7.2% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec declined 0.4% due to growth in our PLS relationships and lower demand for respiratory panels, partially offset by an increase in unit price reimbursement and test mix. Positive unit price reimbursement was consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $342 million or 14.9% of revenues compared to $392 million or 15.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $380 million or 16.6% of revenues compared to $423 million or 17% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases and higher benefit costs, partially offset by growth in the base business, lower performance-based compensation and headcount reductions. We continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions and our actions to reduce support costs by approximately $100 million this year remain on track. Reported EPS was $1.96 in the quarter compared to $2.17 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.22 compared to $2.36 last year. Cash from operations year-to-date was $745 million versus $1.38 billion in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income and timing of collections. Turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.19 billion and $9.24 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.99 billion and $9.04 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be approximately $200 million. Reported EPS narrowed to be in a range of $7.61 to $7.71 and adjusted EPS narrowed to a range of $8.65 to $8.75 with the midpoint of $8.70, unchanged. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.\nJim Davis : Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we delivered solid base business revenue growth of nearly 5% in the quarter. We successfully completed negotiations for all of our strategic health plan relationships that were scheduled for this year. We also drove improved productivity in our base business as we have done throughout 2023. Finally, given the strength of our base business, combined with a robust pipeline of professional lab services and M&A opportunities, we are well positioned for continued growth ahead. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.\nAnn Hynes : Can you just comment on progress on what's happening with the turnover? And do you still feel good about your 16.5% margin goal for 2023?\nJim Davis: Yes, the employee turnover, again, improved from Q2 to Q3. So we're certainly seeing improvements as we've marched from Q1 to Q2 to Q3 and expect to see more improvements as we go to Q4. Having said that, we're still not back to 2019 or pre-COVID levels. But we feel optimistic that as we go into next year, it will actually be a continued tailwind for us. Sam, do you want to comment on...\nSam Samad: Yes, sure. Ann, thanks for the question. So as you recall on the Q2 call, we talked about operating margin expectations being approximately 16.5%. As Jim mentioned, we're seeing slight improvements in terms of turnover. We have made some investments and are going to be making some investments in terms of frontline phlebotomist in anticipation of volumes coming into the winter season here, but also the strong utilization that we've seen. And with regards to margins, we now expect to be slightly below the approximately 16.5% for the year. We're making really good progress on all the cost initiatives and also the productivity improvement initiatives. Volumes have been strong, but we -- especially in light of volumes, we have to make some targeted investments in terms of frontline staff and phlebotomist.\nJim Davis: Yes. Ann, let me just make one other comment on the margins. If you go back and start with Q1 of this year. In Q1, we were just slightly north of 15% and in that quarter, we did $120 million of COVID revenue. And as you know, the reimbursement was still at $100 that quarter. We go to the second quarter, and we improved our margins up to 16.7%, with COVID going from $120 million down to $41 million. And then the second quarter COVID was at a blended rate of, call it, $75. Now we go back into the third quarter and COVID is really insignificant in our results. It's only 1% of our total revenue and the reimbursement on that small 1%, as you know, for the whole quarter was at $50. And we hit 16.6%, so basically in line with Q2, so we're really proud of the productivity efforts and it's really coming through in these numbers and the progress that the teams have made from Q1 to Q2 to Q3.\nOperator: And our next call is David Westenberg with Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg : So just -- thank you for the commentary on the FDA's proposal on LDTs. I'm not sure if you can answer it yet because, I mean, right now, it's still kind of maybe a little bit more hypothetical here. But how should we anticipate potential cost if it stands the way it is. I mean, is this about going back to the FDA with some of the more high-value tests? Or is this maybe about switching out to maybe IVD-cleared products. I mean how does this look for Quest and I get some of this is maybe theoretical right now because we don't know what it's going to look like in a month.\nJim Davis: Yes. I think your last statement is accurate. It's largely theoretical at this point because we don't know what it's going to look like. And the FDA certainly opened this up to commentary and response back from industry and ACLA and other associations. Look, having said all that, LDTs are not the most significant part of our operations. In fact, it's -- on a volume basis, it's less than 10% of what we do. And the 3 labs that we do are LDTs, most -- the majority of our LDTs in are actually ISO certified. We do companion diagnostics, which is a regulated form of testing, right? You're on label for a pharmaceutical drug, so it's just not -- it's not a huge deal for us right now. Now having said all that, we're going to work with our trade association. We don't believe the rule makes sense. We don't believe it's fair. And we'll continue to work to arrive at something that we do think is good for everyone. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. \nLisa Gill: I'm just curious if you have an update as to how we should think about PAMA or SALSA going into 2024 given the current environment in DC. \nJames Davis : Well, you're right, the current environment is a little uncertain at this point. But here's what I would say. The current standstill in Congress, I think we'll make what we call a comprehensive PAMA reform more difficult, right? So SALSA, I think, will be more difficult to get through this year. Having said all that, PAMA, a delay in the cuts of PAMA, again, went to the CBO. So this is a new analysis from the CBO updated versus last year. And again, the CBO scored a 1-year delay as a significant cost savings to the government. And again, the reasons for that is because if you continue to delay the PAMA cuts, you're going to continue to delay a new data collection process. And we, our trade association and obviously, the CBO is convinced that a new data collection process will lead to higher rates. So we feel good that the likelihood of a fourth PAMA delay will occur. But certainly, it has to be part of some broader health care package. And there's a lot of things that will be in that health care package that are important to a lot of different constituencies. So we're confident that something will get done there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nKieran Ryan: You've got Kieran Ryan on for Pito. Just looking at the sequential margin progression implied from 3Q to 4Q this year. It looks like it's materially better than kind of what you averaged in that pre-COVID 2017 -- 2019 range. So is that just really the tailwinds you have around CIT Invigorate better turnover and lower deferred comp just combining to drive better trends than normal. And I was just wondering, is there any offset there on some of these oil and commodity-related costs that we've seen step-up relatively recently? \nSam Samad: Yeah, Kiran, this is Sam. Thanks for the question. So I think some of the drivers that you would expect in Q4 are, you know, what we've been executing and seeing in Q3 and earlier in the year. I mean, Jim talked about the sequential improvement in operating margins despite the fact that COVID is coming down significantly. So what we would expect in Q4 is the following that helps our margins, which has been playing out so far over the course of the year. One is price. We continue to see a healthy positive environment around price and we, in fact, saw positive price in Q3, and we expect to see positive price in Q4. And that's driven by all the work that we're doing around the strategic plan, the third-party plan renewals and some of the value-based contracting that we're doing there. So definitely, the healthiest pricing environment that we've seen in a while. CIT, as you said, is a factor. It was dilutive in the first quarter. It turned profitable in the second quarter. It was profitable in the third, and we expect it to be profitable again in the fourth. We continue to do the cost -- I mean, we see the benefit of the cost reductions in Q4. We talked about $100 million of annual impact of cost reductions on the SG&A line, and we expect to see that at least 1/3 of that be in Q4 as well because those savings started in Q2 and then we're taking a lot of actions as well around improving productivity. Invigorate is one of them that you mentioned, but that's also factoring into margin. So all of that is driving the better than pre-pandemic trends that you've talked about. Now as I said earlier, we are still seeing turnover in -- higher than what we would expect. It has improved slightly in Q3, but it is still trending higher than where it was pre-pandemic. And as I said, given the strong utilization that we're seeing across the business, and we saw that in Q3 as well, we're having to make some targeted increases across frontline staff and phlebotomists to help service some of these volumes. And we expect that to be an impact in Q4 and offsetting more of a headwind of an impact.\nOperator: Our next caller is Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore.\nElizabeth Anderson : I guess I just want to double click on the gross margin a little bit more in the third quarter. I think in different answers, you've given us bits and pieces. But if you could just talk either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis, sort of rank or either if you have dollar amounts or sort of rank order the biggest contributing factors? And then secondly, it sounds like you have some good sightline into the Invigorate savings in fourth quarter and some continued productivity initiatives. How do we think about the flow-through on sort of that -- as we start to think about 2024 and sort of what we might be expecting from those sort cost saving in Invigorate programs?\nSam Samad: Yes. Thank you. So with regards to gross margin, gross margins in Q3 were in line with our expectations. I mean, the key driver, I would say, for them being below Q2 levels, were the fact that we had lower revenues of $45 million going in Q3 versus Q2. So sequentially, we saw a $45 million lower revenues. Now a portion of that was COVID, not the biggest portion. It was about roughly $15 million lower revenues in terms of COVID. And then because of seasonality, as expected, we saw lower revenues on the base [Technical Difficulty] as well. So when you think about the impact on gross margins and gross margins were down a percentage point sequentially, that's almost entirely driven by revenue, the revenue decline. And then on COVID, we're also talking about -- or what we are seeing in Q3 was a lower price around COVID. In Q2, driven by the fact that the PHE didn't end until midway through the quarter, we saw a higher price on average for COVID, we saw a lower price in Q3. So that has an impact on gross margin as well. So those are the key drivers on gross margin. It's in line with our expectations. Invigorate, and Jim will make a couple of comments on Invigorate here. But with regards to Invigorate the actions are yielding the 3% productivity improvements and cost reductions that we expected. And those will continue into 2024. But Jim, maybe make a couple of comments.\nJim Davis: Yes, certainly, Elizabeth. So we're going to set targets going into 2024 that are similar to what we've done in the past. So we expect to generate approximately 3% variable cost productivity throughout our entire operations. That's phlebotomy, logistics, the front end of our lab and then actually all of the processing. We've talked broadly about the use of automation. We're Driving that as fast and furious as we can. We've talked about the use of artificial intelligence to do some of the manual work that our lab text, this could be automated reading of curves. We've talked about in the past, the use of artificial intelligence and microbiology, hematology, urinalysis, and then we continue to work the standard things that we always work as a business, reimbursement and denials is always a big bucket of opportunity for us. Paper [reqs], I talked in the prepared remarks about implementing OCR technology to read all of these paper [reqs] that still come in. We work them down every single year, but there's still a fair number. Even if it's 15% to 20%, when you do the math on that, close to 200 million rec, there's still a ton of opportunity there. So we feel good about our productivity efforts going into next year. We invest in it. We put talented teams around it, and we'll continue to drive it hard.\nOperator: Next caller is Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin : I've got two. The first one, just going back to PAMA. In 2023, it got delayed, and I think it will probably get delayed in '24. But in '23, we didn't see a lot of the savings dropped down to the bottom line because of Haystack and some of the other investments that you're doing. I guess, for '24, does that drop down, if we're to get delayed, i.e., is it accretive to what your plans would be is that you're going to do it? Or does it get offset by that? So that's the first one. And then I've got a follow-up.\nJim Davis: Yes. Well, first, I'd say with respect to the drop down, when we look at the drop-down on the incremental growth we've gotten through our base business and we look at the drop-down on that growth, we're pretty happy with it, okay? And that is after the dilution effect that we've seen from Haystack, the investments we're making there, which are going to propel future growth. As we go into next year, we will take -- we're not going to give guidance today, but we're going to take a close look if PAMA does get delayed, we'll obviously look at both investment opportunities to drive future growth. We'll look at investment opportunities to drive margin improvement, Invigorate investments. And then we'll also obviously look at returning like we always do, the majority of our free cash to shareholders.\nDerik De Bruin : And just a follow-up on the Alzheimer's diagnostics, are you going to seek FDA approval for that? I'm just sort of curious on reimbursement, patient cost, what's the test cost in doing it? I'm just curious on sort of what your strategy is there given that it is a new diagnostic category.\nJim Davis: Okay. So there is reimbursement for the test today. CMS has established about $100 reimbursement for the blood-based AD 4240 test. Having said all that, the preponderance of our orders and the preponderance of our reimbursement actually comes from client build, where we directly bill health systems that are carrying for these patients. And I would tell you that the reimbursement is better than what we see on average from Medicare because it's an incredibly value-added test. So we price it appropriately. At this point, we're not seeking FDA approval for it, it's an LDT like many of the LDTs that we run. And so, we're pretty happy with it. The growth has been substantial and I would also tell you that the growth of our CSF testing, the cerebral spinal fluid testing is also significantly up in the quarter as clinicians are using both CSF and blood-based biomarkers to make to help with the diagnosis of patients.\nSam Samad: And Derek, maybe just to come back to the PAMA question and add a couple of points there for you and others that are on the call. Given the uncertainty around PAMA, we will plan today as if PAMA is going to come back and will not be delayed in 2024. I'd say that's the prudent thing to do. That's the only thing we can do at this stage given the uncertainty. So we will plan as if prices will come down next year because PAMA will come back. Now if -- as we -- I would say, on balance, I'd say there's a likely chance that PAMA will get delayed. And if that were to happen, and as we've talked about before, we could see an $80 million to $90 million benefit as a result of that delay, not benefit versus this year, but benefit versus our planning. And when that -- and if that happens, I should say, then we will assess how much we invest in the business to everything that Jim said earlier to how much potentially could drop to the bottom line to EPS. But that decision is not made yet. We'll make that decision when we set guidance. And will evaluate investments that we can make and then evaluate what we can drive as EPS improvement.\nOperator: Our next caller is Andrew Brackmann with William Blair.\nAndrew Brackmann : Jim, I want to go back to your comments around reducing leakage to high cost labs. I think you talked about in your opening remarks. I know that's sort of part of the strategy here, but can you maybe just sort of talk about that opportunity broadly and just sort of quantify how big that could be for your growth going forward?\nJim Davis: Yes. I think there's 2 buckets of opportunity there. One is reducing leakage to out-of-network labs. And then the second is what I would call steerage of work from high-priced in-network labs generally in health systems to independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. So generally 2 different initiatives, but it really starts with just very strong and tight collaboration with our commercial payers. We work hand-in-hand with them. They provide us the information on what physicians are using out-of-network high-priced laboratories, and they provide us the information that what doctors are sending work into health system labs, which, as you know, not good for patients who are going to pay higher deductibles, higher co-pays and obviously not good for the people that are paying for the health care in general, that's still employers in the country. So it's a really tight partnership. We get the information. We distribute that information out to our commercial team. We call on the customers, try to convince them to move the work. At the same time, we're always messaging as are the commercial payers out to patients to remind them that they can save money by using independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. We continue to message physicians and providers, and that's why we're seeing significantly higher growth rates with the commercial plans where we have established these types of relationships.\nOperator: Our next caller is Kevin Caliendo with UBS.\nKevin Caliendo : Congrats on the contract renewals with your major payer partners. Can you maybe talk a little bit about if there's anything new in the contracts, the duration of the contracts? Is there -- the last time you did this, there were incentives that actually benefited you in terms of driving volumes. Just wondering if anything has changed, both positively or negatively, pricing, duration, terms, incentives, that kind of thing?\nJim Davis: Yes. We generally don't talk about the terms, duration and things like that. But what I will tell you is that the trend continues. We seek to establish a fair price first and foremost. And then second, as I just mentioned in the previous question, where we can move these requisitions and improve our share of the commercial payer spend. We try to design incentives around that. In addition, we try to design incentives, when we do a hospital outreach acquisition and the prices go from 300% of Medicare as an example down to our rates, we try to step those rates down over a period of time so that we derive benefit and the commercial plan derives benefit. So we work hard to build those types of incentives into the agreement and I think the trend just continues in the direction we want.\nKevin Caliendo : Does this lead to sort of more value-based care potential for you guys going forward?\nJim Davis: Well, I separate again, value-based care from value-based contracts. These are what we call value-based contracts, meaning when we deliver value back to the commercial payer, there can be incentive payments involved in that. When we talk about value-based care, these are really our arrangements with some of these ACO reach organizations and some of the other large physician groups that have taken on risk from Medicare Advantage plans. And we continue to embed ourselves when these within these ACO reach programs and continue to work closely with large physician groups that take on this risk. And as we said in the past as we said in the past, when these types of relationships are really good for the lab industry, they -- if you're managing risk, you're managing the cost of health care to a fixed number every year, you're generally going to be incented to provide early care and early diagnostics so that you don't let disease progress into more expensive inpatient care and we continue to work towards that.\nOperator: Our next caller is Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan : I have a couple of cleanup questions for Sam. First is on collections. So seeing a little AR build? I know you called it out, but anything -- any color you can add on that? And then second is on the base growth, 5% pretty good. I was just wondering if weather weekdays had any impact could have actually been better on an underlying basis?\nSam Samad: Yes. Sure. I'll take the first one, Jack, and Jim will talk a little bit about the -- any one-timer, so to speak, whether days. Listen, collections nothing of note there. I think AR trending or DSO is trending a bit up. That's really more normal trends given the reduction in COVID. With COVID, I think that would help our DSOs overall a shorter collection window and DSOs were down as a result of a higher mix of COVID. But if you look back to pre-pandemic, I think the DSOs are kind of trending back to where they were pre-pandemic. So really nothing of note there. There's some timing at the end of Q3 as well, but that's just normal timing within quarters. So I would say, in general, collections are on track, and we're happy with where things are. But Jim, did you want to make a couple of comments around base earning growth and any one-timers?\nJim Davis: Yes, weather and days and things like that, versus last year, weather was a slight help I mean, not significant at all, Jack, but it was a slight help because last year's hurricane in September was worse than this year's hurricane. The only other comment on days that I would make is early in the quarter in July. The fourth of July fell on a Tuesday this year versus a Monday last year. So in essence, your Monday and Tuesday are really, really bad days versus a year ago. You only had one bad day called a Monday because the fourth fell on a Monday. But again, that's one day out of 90. So yes, I mean, a little bit of an impact there, but not that significant.\nOperator: Our next caller is Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly : Maybe a couple of follow-ups on Haystack. It sounds like still a 24 time line there. Can you just talk about I guess, any more specific timing and the catalyst set there when we could expect to see some data? And then just also the spend expectations related to getting that through the approval process as we work our way through \u201824 would be helpful.\nJim Davis: Yes, as we've said, Haystack continues on the timeline that we set for ourselves, for the team. There's been evidence generation, obviously that's what we made our -- was part of our decision-making process. Now as we get the assay, what I call ready for commercial release, commercial production, we're in the process of establishing relationships with some of our key oncology partners. So when the assay is ready, we'll start to do some of the testing likely we'll use a lot of that early testing to then seek reimbursement once we get a substantial buildup of testing that we feel good about approaching the Maxon and so far, so good. We're bringing up the assay, as we mentioned, in our Lewisville, Texas Oncology Center of Excellence and feel good about that. I'll let Sam touch on the financials with respect to...\nSam Samad: Yes, sure. I mean with regards to spend, I'll talk in dilution terms and EPS terms here this year, and then I'll talk -- address your question around '24, Patrick. So again, very pleased with the progress that the team is making. This year, we're expecting EPS dilution to be in the $0.15 to $0.20 range. We talked about that on the Q2 call. It's still in the same range, $0.15 to $0.20. If you look towards '24, what we've said and this still applies, is that the annualized dilution in 2024 is going to be less than what we expect to see -- what you see this year. So the $0.15 to $0.20, if you annualize that, that's $0.30 to $0.40 next year. So we expect on an annual basis next year to be less than where things are trending this year. So improvement just on an annual basis. And then as we look forward, we expect 25% dilution to be lower than 24%, and then we expect 26% to actually be accretive. So that's consistent with what we said when we announced the deal consistent with what we said on the Q2 call.\nOperator: Our next caller is Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright : You laid out some of those key profit drivers for the fourth quarter. And as we think about what kind of continues into 2024, I think you mentioned in the previous question kind of -- or a previous question, productivity gains should continue, and I understand there's PAMA dynamics as well that are somewhat unknown. But should we anticipate a deviation from the long-term profit guidance is like 50 to 100 basis points operating margin expansion next year?\nSam Samad: Well, let me clarify, Erin, and thanks for the question, by the way. So what we talked about at Investor Day is an improvement of 75 to 150 basis points over the 3 years and that's off of the rate that we have for 2023. So we had said at the time the rate was approximately 17%. We said we could improve over the next 3 years by 75 to 150 basis points in terms of operating margin with the lower end being PAMA did come back in '24 and the higher end of 150 being either if we had comprehensive reform around SALSA or PAMA gets delayed. So the 75 to 150 over the 3 years still applies. That has not changed. Now it's going to apply off of a lower base in 2023 because our operating margin expectations have come down. As I said earlier on the call, we expect it to be slightly below -- marginally below the approximately 16.5% that we talked about on the Q2 call. The positive drivers and by the way, that operating margin expansion was for 3 -- over the 3 years, not for 2024. But the positive drivers in 2024 still apply. I mean, first of all, first and foremost, I would say, is the pricing environment. We are very encouraged by the pricing environment. We talked about the strategic relationships that have been renewed, and we're seeing positive price ex PAMA, depending on what happens next year, but we're seeing positive price, and we expect that to continue. We're seeing the growth investments starting to yield fruit and CIT being one of them. And we talked about that becoming profitable. Productivity improvement, both in terms of Invigorate and also hires that we do, for instance, phlebotomist that we're adding we expect that productivity or their productivity to improve next year as well as they gain more experience and they're more productive. So all of those drivers we expect to continue. Turnover is a bit of an uncertain item. We don't necessarily expect it to become worse than it is today. But it's too early to say right now whether that improves markedly in 2024. The early signs that we saw in Q3. Right now, we're encouraging. We saw some slight improvement, but it's too early to say to project what that would mean for 2024.\nJim Davis: Yes. Erin. The last thing I'd say is we're encouraged by the volume trends. And as you know, incremental volume coming into the business in a business that has lots of fixed costs certainly mixes up the existing margin rate. So we feel good about the volume trends in our physician office. We feel good about the volume trends in health systems. And as I mentioned in the script, we feel good about our funnel of M&A opportunities that are in front of us as we march through the fourth quarter and early next year.\nOperator: Our last caller is Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut : I guess, Sam, just to follow up on Erin's question really quickly. If we think about the composition of margin between gross profit and G&A, is this the right baseline to build off of factoring all the things that you mentioned, such productivity gains and maybe PAMA. And then maybe just, Jim, a quick follow-up. Hospital deals. Obviously, you've had some growth there. How should we be thinking about the pipeline and your ability to sustain the growth rate given what's in the pipeline today?\nSam Samad: Yes. I mean with regards to the first question, Brian, we believe it is the right baseline to build off of. 2024 is not the period to look at in terms of that improvement that we talked about, the 75 to 150. There are a couple of factors in there. One of them, there's the uncertainty of PAMA, obviously. But the other one is COVID, which is approximately $200 million this year, is going to be a factor next year in terms of the drop off. It's going to be a negative factor. Again, albeit a much smaller one than what we saw from '22 into '23, but it's still going to be a factor in terms of the approximately $200 million going to something we believe much less than that as it becomes just another regular test like a flu test, for instance, but the baseline, we believe, is the right one, and we are still confident about the 75 to 150 basis point improvement on operating margin over the 3 years.\nJim Davis: Yes. Brian, as I said in the script, we're encouraged by the breadth and depth of our funnel of opportunities in hospital outreach as well as PLS. And I say that our teams are working them very hard. And the trends are pointing in our direction, right, with the cost of capital going up for health systems, their investments, I think, are truly focusing on the things that will drive growth for health systems, whether that's investments in neurology, cardiology, cancer, obstetric, those are the things that drive growth in health systems. And so when you make all those investments, albeit now at capital costs that are significantly higher, they can turn to us to make the investments they need in laboratories. When you see institutions like New York Presby sell their outreach book of business and really focus their investments on the things that are driving their growth. I think that's a good sign of how health care systems, they're really good strategic ones are really thinking today.\nOperator: That was our last question for the day.\nJim Davis : All right. Everyone, thanks again for joining our call today. We certainly appreciate all your continued support. I also want to thank the Quest Diagnostics team who, as we've transitioned away from COVID, have really done a magnificent job in continuing to drive growth in our base business, drive productivity and continue to satisfy our patients, providers and all those that use Quest Diagnostics. So thanks, everyone, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. A transcript of the prepared remarks on this call will be posted later today on Quest Diagnostics website at www.questdiagnostics.com.

            "content": "Quarter consolidated revenues were $2.3 billion, down 7.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 4.6% to $2.27 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 92% to $26 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 7.9% compared to the prior year reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing versus the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by growth in our base business. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined 0.5% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 5.7% versus the prior year. Revenue per requisition declined 7.2% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per rec declined 0.4% due to growth in our PLS relationships and lower demand for respiratory panels, partially offset by an increase in unit price reimbursement and test mix. Positive unit price reimbursement was consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $342 million or 14.9% of revenues compared to $392 million or 15.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $380 million or 16.6% of revenues compared to $423 million or 17% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases and higher benefit costs, partially offset by growth in the base business, lower performance-based compensation and headcount reductions. We continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions and our actions to reduce support costs by approximately $100 million this year remain on track. Reported EPS was $1.96 in the quarter compared to $2.17 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.22 compared to $2.36 last year. Cash from operations year-to-date was $745 million versus $1.38 billion in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income and timing of collections. Turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.19 billion and $9.24 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.99 billion and $9.04 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be approximately $200 million. Reported EPS narrowed to be in a range of $7.61 to $7.71 and adjusted EPS narrowed to a range of $8.65 to $8.75 with the midpoint of $8.70, unchanged. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Yes, sure. Ann, thanks for the question. So as you recall on the Q2 call, we talked about operating margin expectations being approximately 16.5%. As Jim mentioned, we're seeing slight improvements in terms of turnover. We have made some investments and are going to be making some investments in terms of frontline phlebotomist in anticipation of volumes coming into the winter season here, but also the strong utilization that we've seen. And with regards to margins, we now expect to be slightly below the approximately 16.5% for the year. We're making really good progress on all the cost initiatives and also the productivity improvement initiatives. Volumes have been strong, but we -- especially in light of volumes, we have to make some targeted investments in terms of frontline staff and phlebotomist. Yeah, Kiran, this is Sam. Thanks for the question. So I think some of the drivers that you would expect in Q4 are, you know, what we've been executing and seeing in Q3 and earlier in the year. I mean, Jim talked about the sequential improvement in operating margins despite the fact that COVID is coming down significantly. So what we would expect in Q4 is the following that helps our margins, which has been playing out so far over the course of the year. One is price. We continue to see a healthy positive environment around price and we, in fact, saw positive price in Q3, and we expect to see positive price in Q4. And that's driven by all the work that we're doing around the strategic plan, the third-party plan renewals and some of the value-based contracting that we're doing there. So definitely, the healthiest pricing environment that we've seen in a while. CIT, as you said, is a factor. It was dilutive in the first quarter. It turned profitable in the second quarter. It was profitable in the third, and we expect it to be profitable again in the fourth. We continue to do the cost -- I mean, we see the benefit of the cost reductions in Q4. We talked about $100 million of annual impact of cost reductions on the SG&A line, and we expect to see that at least 1/3 of that be in Q4 as well because those savings started in Q2 and then we're taking a lot of actions as well around improving productivity. Invigorate is one of them that you mentioned, but that's also factoring into margin. So all of that is driving the better than pre-pandemic trends that you've talked about. Now as I said earlier, we are still seeing turnover in -- higher than what we would expect. It has improved slightly in Q3, but it is still trending higher than where it was pre-pandemic. And as I said, given the strong utilization that we're seeing across the business, and we saw that in Q3 as well, we're having to make some targeted increases across frontline staff and phlebotomists to help service some of these volumes. And we expect that to be an impact in Q4 and offsetting more of a headwind of an impact. Yes. Thank you. So with regards to gross margin, gross margins in Q3 were in line with our expectations. I mean, the key driver, I would say, for them being below Q2 levels, were the fact that we had lower revenues of $45 million going in Q3 versus Q2. So sequentially, we saw a $45 million lower revenues. Now a portion of that was COVID, not the biggest portion. It was about roughly $15 million lower revenues in terms of COVID. And then because of seasonality, as expected, we saw lower revenues on the base [Technical Difficulty] as well. So when you think about the impact on gross margins and gross margins were down a percentage point sequentially, that's almost entirely driven by revenue, the revenue decline. And then on COVID, we're also talking about -- or what we are seeing in Q3 was a lower price around COVID. In Q2, driven by the fact that the PHE didn't end until midway through the quarter, we saw a higher price on average for COVID, we saw a lower price in Q3. So that has an impact on gross margin as well. So those are the key drivers on gross margin. It's in line with our expectations. Invigorate, and Jim will make a couple of comments on Invigorate here. But with regards to Invigorate the actions are yielding the 3% productivity improvements and cost reductions that we expected. And those will continue into 2024. But Jim, maybe make a couple of comments. And Derek, maybe just to come back to the PAMA question and add a couple of points there for you and others that are on the call. Given the uncertainty around PAMA, we will plan today as if PAMA is going to come back and will not be delayed in 2024. I'd say that's the prudent thing to do. That's the only thing we can do at this stage given the uncertainty. So we will plan as if prices will come down next year because PAMA will come back. Now if -- as we -- I would say, on balance, I'd say there's a likely chance that PAMA will get delayed. And if that were to happen, and as we've talked about before, we could see an $80 million to $90 million benefit as a result of that delay, not benefit versus this year, but benefit versus our planning. And when that -- and if that happens, I should say, then we will assess how much we invest in the business to everything that Jim said earlier to how much potentially could drop to the bottom line to EPS. But that decision is not made yet. We'll make that decision when we set guidance. And will evaluate investments that we can make and then evaluate what we can drive as EPS improvement. Yes. Sure. I'll take the first one, Jack, and Jim will talk a little bit about the -- any one-timer, so to speak, whether days. Listen, collections nothing of note there. I think AR trending or DSO is trending a bit up. That's really more normal trends given the reduction in COVID. With COVID, I think that would help our DSOs overall a shorter collection window and DSOs were down as a result of a higher mix of COVID. But if you look back to pre-pandemic, I think the DSOs are kind of trending back to where they were pre-pandemic. So really nothing of note there. There's some timing at the end of Q3 as well, but that's just normal timing within quarters. So I would say, in general, collections are on track, and we're happy with where things are. But Jim, did you want to make a couple of comments around base earning growth and any one-timers? Yes, sure. I mean with regards to spend, I'll talk in dilution terms and EPS terms here this year, and then I'll talk -- address your question around '24, Patrick. So again, very pleased with the progress that the team is making. This year, we're expecting EPS dilution to be in the $0.15 to $0.20 range. We talked about that on the Q2 call. It's still in the same range, $0.15 to $0.20. If you look towards '24, what we've said and this still applies, is that the annualized dilution in 2024 is going to be less than what we expect to see -- what you see this year. So the $0.15 to $0.20, if you annualize that, that's $0.30 to $0.40 next year. So we expect on an annual basis next year to be less than where things are trending this year. So improvement just on an annual basis. And then as we look forward, we expect 25% dilution to be lower than 24%, and then we expect 26% to actually be accretive. So that's consistent with what we said when we announced the deal consistent with what we said on the Q2 call. Well, let me clarify, Erin, and thanks for the question, by the way. So what we talked about at Investor Day is an improvement of 75 to 150 basis points over the 3 years and that's off of the rate that we have for 2023. So we had said at the time the rate was approximately 17%. We said we could improve over the next 3 years by 75 to 150 basis points in terms of operating margin with the lower end being PAMA did come back in '24 and the higher end of 150 being either if we had comprehensive reform around SALSA or PAMA gets delayed. So the 75 to 150 over the 3 years still applies. That has not changed. Now it's going to apply off of a lower base in 2023 because our operating margin expectations have come down. As I said earlier on the call, we expect it to be slightly below -- marginally below the approximately 16.5% that we talked about on the Q2 call. The positive drivers and by the way, that operating margin expansion was for 3 -- over the 3 years, not for 2024. But the positive drivers in 2024 still apply. I mean, first of all, first and foremost, I would say, is the pricing environment. We are very encouraged by the pricing environment. We talked about the strategic relationships that have been renewed, and we're seeing positive price ex PAMA, depending on what happens next year, but we're seeing positive price, and we expect that to continue. We're seeing the growth investments starting to yield fruit and CIT being one of them. And we talked about that becoming profitable. Productivity improvement, both in terms of Invigorate and also hires that we do, for instance, phlebotomist that we're adding we expect that productivity or their productivity to improve next year as well as they gain more experience and they're more productive. So all of those drivers we expect to continue. Turnover is a bit of an uncertain item. We don't necessarily expect it to become worse than it is today. But it's too early to say right now whether that improves markedly in 2024. The early signs that we saw in Q3. Right now, we're encouraging. We saw some slight improvement, but it's too early to say to project what that would mean for 2024. Yes. I mean with regards to the first question, Brian, we believe it is the right baseline to build off of. 2024 is not the period to look at in terms of that improvement that we talked about, the 75 to 150. There are a couple of factors in there. One of them, there's the uncertainty of PAMA, obviously. But the other one is COVID, which is approximately $200 million this year, is going to be a factor next year in terms of the drop off. It's going to be a negative factor. Again, albeit a much smaller one than what we saw from '22 into '23, but it's still going to be a factor in terms of the approximately $200 million going to something we believe much less than that as it becomes just another regular test like a flu test, for instance, but the baseline, we believe, is the right one, and we are still confident about the 75 to 150 basis point improvement on operating margin over the 3 years."

            "name": "Jim Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We grew our base business nearly 5% in the third quarter, largely by driving growth in our physician and hospital channels. Our consumer channel also continued to produce solid base business revenue growth. In addition, we are pleased that we have now successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled for this year. These strength and collaborations will position us to build on growth opportunities going forward our Invigorate program is on track to deliver 3% annual productivity improvements and savings. In addition, the productivity of our base business improved sequentially and year-over-year. Given the strength of our business and a robust pipeline of professional lab services and M&A opportunities, we are well positioned for continued growth. This morning, I'll discuss highlights from the third quarter, then Sam will provide more details on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2023. Now let's turn to some of the highlights from the quarter. Our strategy is to drive growth by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers. We are enabling growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions remain a key driver of our growth with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller independent labs. Finally, our strategy includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service. Here are a few key updates on the progress we have made in these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered mid-single-digit base business revenue growth driven by the strength in our cardiometabolic and general health and wellness testing. Our strong relationships with health plans were also a key driver in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we successfully completed negotiations for all our strategic health plan renewals that were scheduled for this year. Our success is a result of the clinical and economic value we deliver to health plans and their members. Today, more than 50% of the health of the health plan revenues are generated from these value-based contracts, which are fueling double-digit growth compared to our traditional health plan contracts. Together with the health plans, we have a renewed focus on initiatives to reduce leakage to high-cost out-of-network labs. In addition, we are working together to redirect volume from high-cost labs to Quest. Importantly, this is good for both patients and employers which are paying for the majority of health care costs. In hospital lab services, base revenues grew high single digits in the quarter as we saw strength in hospital reference testing and continued progress with our most recent PLS relationships, including Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health. Our hospital strategy is to help health systems improve productivity and patient care by delivering innovative laboratory testing that is high quality, accessible and affordable. We continue to manage a robust pipeline of professional lab services and hospital outreach acquisition opportunities. Health systems continue to face labor and cost pressures, which are prompting more of them to reach out to us for help with their lab strategy and in some cases, monetize their hospital outreach business. Our professional lab services can help manage hospitals labs, supply chain and workforce. We are also providing insights from our analytical solutions to guide hospitals to deliver the right test to the right patient at the right time. In addition, hospital outreach acquisitions enable health systems to focus their expertise and capital on the areas of their business that support patient care and drive growth. In Consumer Health, we generated solid base business revenue growth from our consumer-initiated testing channel in the quarter. In addition, our consumer channel was again profitable this quarter. We attribute the strong performance to continuing demand for our expanded test menu, including STIs, comprehensive health and tuberculosis blood testing. Underpinning each of these key channels, physician, hospital and consumer is our advanced diagnostics. These highly innovative higher-growth test areas include molecular genomics and oncology as well as several other key areas. During the quarter, we grew revenues double digits in multiple clinical areas including neurology, women's and reproductive health, cardiometabolic and infectious disease and immunology. We are particularly encouraged by growth in our Alzheimer's disease portfolio, which features our AD-Detect blood testing services. These innovative services use highly sensitive mass spectrometry technologies to provide insight into Alzheimer's risk based on amyloid proteins and the APOE genetic risk marker. During the quarter, we saw strong demand for our Alzheimer's cerebral spinal fluid panel as well, which helps providers identified levels of both amyloid and tau proteins as well as the APOE status. We also grew significantly in women's and reproductive health, especially in non-invasive prenatal and carrier screening tests. During the quarter, the FDA granted breakthrough designation for our adeno-associated virus called AAV companion diagnostic, which we developed in collaboration with Sarepta Therapeutics for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy. This FDA designation places us at the forefront of AAV test innovation in the growing area of cell and gene therapies and positions us to build collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies. Finally, the integration of Haystack Oncology remains on track. The acquisition positions us to enter the high-growth liquid biopsy area of minimal residual disease or MRD testing. We expect to launch our first MRD test in early 2024 from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas. Now turning to operational and productivity improvement. Our Invigorate program is well on its way to delivering our targeted 3% annual productivity improvements and savings. I'd like to share 3 examples of how we're improving operations. First, we are deploying front-end automation to enhance specimen processing in our Pittsburgh and Dallas laboratories, which will improve quality and productivity. More sites are planned to receive front-end automation during 2024. We are expanding the use of optical character recognition, or OCR, to scan in data from samples coming into our labs. By freeing up specimen processors from this manual data entry, we will improve our productivity of paper-based recs coming into all of our regional labs by 30%. Finally, we continue to optimize our real estate footprint. Post pandemic, we need less space for some of our call center and administrative functions. We've reduced our real estate footprint by nearly 250,000 square feet by consolidating functions into existing spaces. Before I hand it over to Sam, I'd like to offer our perspective on the rule recently proposed by the Food and Drug Administration that would regulate laboratory developed tests as medical devices. Lab developed tests are essential medical innovations that providers use to guide care for patients every day. These services are highly regulated under federal legislation known as CLIA. In addition to the oversight by states, accredited bodies and Medicare as it makes coverage determinations. If enacted, the FDA's proposed rule would impact patient care by compromising access, slowing diagnostic innovation and adding unnecessary cost to our health care system. We agree with the long-standing assertion of our trade association, ACLA, that the FDA does not have the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate LDTs under its existing medical device authority. Now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance. Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we delivered solid base business revenue growth of nearly 5% in the quarter. We successfully completed negotiations for all of our strategic health plan relationships that were scheduled for this year. We also drove improved productivity in our base business as we have done throughout 2023. Finally, given the strength of our base business, combined with a robust pipeline of professional lab services and M&A opportunities, we are well positioned for continued growth ahead. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Yes, the employee turnover, again, improved from Q2 to Q3. So we're certainly seeing improvements as we've marched from Q1 to Q2 to Q3 and expect to see more improvements as we go to Q4. Having said that, we're still not back to 2019 or pre-COVID levels. But we feel optimistic that as we go into next year, it will actually be a continued tailwind for us. Sam, do you want to comment on... Yes. Ann, let me just make one other comment on the margins. If you go back and start with Q1 of this year. In Q1, we were just slightly north of 15% and in that quarter, we did $120 million of COVID revenue. And as you know, the reimbursement was still at $100 that quarter. We go to the second quarter, and we improved our margins up to 16.7%, with COVID going from $120 million down to $41 million. And then the second quarter COVID was at a blended rate of, call it, $75. Now we go back into the third quarter and COVID is really insignificant in our results. It's only 1% of our total revenue and the reimbursement on that small 1%, as you know, for the whole quarter was at $50. And we hit 16.6%, so basically in line with Q2, so we're really proud of the productivity efforts and it's really coming through in these numbers and the progress that the teams have made from Q1 to Q2 to Q3. Yes. I think your last statement is accurate. It's largely theoretical at this point because we don't know what it's going to look like. And the FDA certainly opened this up to commentary and response back from industry and ACLA and other associations. Look, having said all that, LDTs are not the most significant part of our operations. In fact, it's -- on a volume basis, it's less than 10% of what we do. And the 3 labs that we do are LDTs, most -- the majority of our LDTs in are actually ISO certified. We do companion diagnostics, which is a regulated form of testing, right? You're on label for a pharmaceutical drug, so it's just not -- it's not a huge deal for us right now. Now having said all that, we're going to work with our trade association. We don't believe the rule makes sense. We don't believe it's fair. And we'll continue to work to arrive at something that we do think is good for everyone. Yes, certainly, Elizabeth. So we're going to set targets going into 2024 that are similar to what we've done in the past. So we expect to generate approximately 3% variable cost productivity throughout our entire operations. That's phlebotomy, logistics, the front end of our lab and then actually all of the processing. We've talked broadly about the use of automation. We're Driving that as fast and furious as we can. We've talked about the use of artificial intelligence to do some of the manual work that our lab text, this could be automated reading of curves. We've talked about in the past, the use of artificial intelligence and microbiology, hematology, urinalysis, and then we continue to work the standard things that we always work as a business, reimbursement and denials is always a big bucket of opportunity for us. Paper [reqs], I talked in the prepared remarks about implementing OCR technology to read all of these paper [reqs] that still come in. We work them down every single year, but there's still a fair number. Even if it's 15% to 20%, when you do the math on that, close to 200 million rec, there's still a ton of opportunity there. So we feel good about our productivity efforts going into next year. We invest in it. We put talented teams around it, and we'll continue to drive it hard. Yes. Well, first, I'd say with respect to the drop down, when we look at the drop-down on the incremental growth we've gotten through our base business and we look at the drop-down on that growth, we're pretty happy with it, okay? And that is after the dilution effect that we've seen from Haystack, the investments we're making there, which are going to propel future growth. As we go into next year, we will take -- we're not going to give guidance today, but we're going to take a close look if PAMA does get delayed, we'll obviously look at both investment opportunities to drive future growth. We'll look at investment opportunities to drive margin improvement, Invigorate investments. And then we'll also obviously look at returning like we always do, the majority of our free cash to shareholders. Okay. So there is reimbursement for the test today. CMS has established about $100 reimbursement for the blood-based AD 4240 test. Having said all that, the preponderance of our orders and the preponderance of our reimbursement actually comes from client build, where we directly bill health systems that are carrying for these patients. And I would tell you that the reimbursement is better than what we see on average from Medicare because it's an incredibly value-added test. So we price it appropriately. At this point, we're not seeking FDA approval for it, it's an LDT like many of the LDTs that we run. And so, we're pretty happy with it. The growth has been substantial and I would also tell you that the growth of our CSF testing, the cerebral spinal fluid testing is also significantly up in the quarter as clinicians are using both CSF and blood-based biomarkers to make to help with the diagnosis of patients. Yes. I think there's 2 buckets of opportunity there. One is reducing leakage to out-of-network labs. And then the second is what I would call steerage of work from high-priced in-network labs generally in health systems to independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. So generally 2 different initiatives, but it really starts with just very strong and tight collaboration with our commercial payers. We work hand-in-hand with them. They provide us the information on what physicians are using out-of-network high-priced laboratories, and they provide us the information that what doctors are sending work into health system labs, which, as you know, not good for patients who are going to pay higher deductibles, higher co-pays and obviously not good for the people that are paying for the health care in general, that's still employers in the country. So it's a really tight partnership. We get the information. We distribute that information out to our commercial team. We call on the customers, try to convince them to move the work. At the same time, we're always messaging as are the commercial payers out to patients to remind them that they can save money by using independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. We continue to message physicians and providers, and that's why we're seeing significantly higher growth rates with the commercial plans where we have established these types of relationships. Yes. We generally don't talk about the terms, duration and things like that. But what I will tell you is that the trend continues. We seek to establish a fair price first and foremost. And then second, as I just mentioned in the previous question, where we can move these requisitions and improve our share of the commercial payer spend. We try to design incentives around that. In addition, we try to design incentives, when we do a hospital outreach acquisition and the prices go from 300% of Medicare as an example down to our rates, we try to step those rates down over a period of time so that we derive benefit and the commercial plan derives benefit. So we work hard to build those types of incentives into the agreement and I think the trend just continues in the direction we want. Well, I separate again, value-based care from value-based contracts. These are what we call value-based contracts, meaning when we deliver value back to the commercial payer, there can be incentive payments involved in that. When we talk about value-based care, these are really our arrangements with some of these ACO reach organizations and some of the other large physician groups that have taken on risk from Medicare Advantage plans. And we continue to embed ourselves when these within these ACO reach programs and continue to work closely with large physician groups that take on this risk. And as we said in the past as we said in the past, when these types of relationships are really good for the lab industry, they -- if you're managing risk, you're managing the cost of health care to a fixed number every year, you're generally going to be incented to provide early care and early diagnostics so that you don't let disease progress into more expensive inpatient care and we continue to work towards that. Yes, weather and days and things like that, versus last year, weather was a slight help I mean, not significant at all, Jack, but it was a slight help because last year's hurricane in September was worse than this year's hurricane. The only other comment on days that I would make is early in the quarter in July. The fourth of July fell on a Tuesday this year versus a Monday last year. So in essence, your Monday and Tuesday are really, really bad days versus a year ago. You only had one bad day called a Monday because the fourth fell on a Monday. But again, that's one day out of 90. So yes, I mean, a little bit of an impact there, but not that significant. Yes, as we've said, Haystack continues on the timeline that we set for ourselves, for the team. There's been evidence generation, obviously that's what we made our -- was part of our decision-making process. Now as we get the assay, what I call ready for commercial release, commercial production, we're in the process of establishing relationships with some of our key oncology partners. So when the assay is ready, we'll start to do some of the testing likely we'll use a lot of that early testing to then seek reimbursement once we get a substantial buildup of testing that we feel good about approaching the Maxon and so far, so good. We're bringing up the assay, as we mentioned, in our Lewisville, Texas Oncology Center of Excellence and feel good about that. I'll let Sam touch on the financials with respect to... Yes. Erin. The last thing I'd say is we're encouraged by the volume trends. And as you know, incremental volume coming into the business in a business that has lots of fixed costs certainly mixes up the existing margin rate. So we feel good about the volume trends in our physician office. We feel good about the volume trends in health systems. And as I mentioned in the script, we feel good about our funnel of M&A opportunities that are in front of us as we march through the fourth quarter and early next year. Yes. Brian, as I said in the script, we're encouraged by the breadth and depth of our funnel of opportunities in hospital outreach as well as PLS. And I say that our teams are working them very hard. And the trends are pointing in our direction, right, with the cost of capital going up for health systems, their investments, I think, are truly focusing on the things that will drive growth for health systems, whether that's investments in neurology, cardiology, cancer, obstetric, those are the things that drive growth in health systems. And so when you make all those investments, albeit now at capital costs that are significantly higher, they can turn to us to make the investments they need in laboratories. When you see institutions like New York Presby sell their outreach book of business and really focus their investments on the things that are driving their growth. I think that's a good sign of how health care systems, they're really good strategic ones are really thinking today. All right. Everyone, thanks again for joining our call today. We certainly appreciate all your continued support. I also want to thank the Quest Diagnostics team who, as we've transitioned away from COVID, have really done a magnificent job in continuing to drive growth in our base business, drive productivity and continue to satisfy our patients, providers and all those that use Quest Diagnostics. So thanks, everyone, and have a great day."

Now I'd like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Go ahead, please.\nShawn Bevec: Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics' future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing.  Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates.  Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.\nJames Davis: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We had strong base business performance in the second quarter with nearly double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Demand for our services remains strong across all regions boosted by the collaborations we have formed with health plans, hospitals and physicians amid an environment where people are returning to care.  We are particularly encouraged by the revenue growth in our base business of nearly 10% from our health system customers. Also in the second quarter, we made substantial progress improving the profitability of our base business compared to the first quarter and prior year despite persistently high employee turnover.  Total adjusted operating margin improved more than 170 basis points compared to the first quarter despite a decline of approximately $80 million in COVID revenue.  This morning, I'll discuss highlights from the second quarter, then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2023.  Now let's turn to some of the highlights from the quarter. As we shared at Investor Day, our strategy is to drive growth by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers as they navigate the changing landscape in health care. We will enable this growth with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology.  In addition, acquisitions will continue to be key drivers of our growth. Finally, our strategy includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service.  So let's review progress we've made in each one of these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered strong base volume growth from physicians, largely through our partnerships with health plans, which have expanded our access to the market. A growing number of these involve value-based arrangements and are generating faster growth and share gains than the traditional relationships. These arrangements position us as a more strategic partner with health plans as we work together on leakage, shared savings and redirection programs.  In addition, NewYork-Presbyterian's recently acquired outreach assets brought us new volume from the physicians.  In Hospital Lab Services, base revenue from health systems grew nearly 10% in the quarter. The Professional Lab Services business had a very strong quarter as we saw solid growth from both new and existing PLS relationships.  We are particularly encouraged by progress with our new PLS partnerships with Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health. As hospitals continue to experience financial challenges, we are here to help whether through professional lab services, reference testing or purchasing the hospital's outreach assets. We are now seeing growing momentum with a significant pipeline of potential deals with large health systems.  In Consumer Health, we had strong base business growth on questhealth.com. We continue to optimize our marketing efforts to target our customers more strategically and now expect consumer-initiated testing to be profitable through the balance of 2023.  Also during the quarter, we launched Genetic Insights, our first consumer-initiated genetics health test on questhealth.com. This saliva-based test leverages our expertise in Next-Generation Sequencing to analyze 3 dozen genes for inherited risk of conditions ranging from breast and colon cancer through carrier status for cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs. We are encouraged by initial demand for this new offering, which adds to our growing test options for health-minded consumers.  As discussed at Investor Day in March, a key pillar of our strategy is to support faster growth across all customer segments through highly specialized advanced diagnostics. These offerings include molecular genomics and oncology tests such as germline testing to assess prenatal and hereditary genetic risk and somatic testing for tumor sequencing.  Advanced Diagnostics also encompasses other key areas, including neurology, women's reproductive health and cardiometabolic health. In neurology, we continue to achieve strong growth from our innovative Quest AD-Detect, portfolio of Alzheimer's blood tests, which help identify early indications of beta amyloid and ApoE status. AD-Detect strongly positions Quest to lead in this rapidly evolving Alzheimer's landscape. Emerging therapies for Alzheimer's represent a new era in treatment and testing for this disease. Like many diseases, early intervention in Alzheimer's may promote better outcomes.  Our AD-Detect portfolio enables accessible and convenient evaluation of Alzheimer's risk potentially at early stages and the monitoring of progression. AD-Detect is now available to our physician customers in the U.S., and we believe it also has the potential to generate strong consumer demand.  In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our cardiometabolic, endocrinology, infectious disease and carrier and prenatal genetic screening services. In June, we completed our acquisition of Haystack Oncology, which positions us to enter the high-growth area of minimal residual disease or MRD testing. Haystack has developed a highly sensitive technique for early detection of residual or recurring cancer with the potential to improve outcomes for patients being treated for cancer.  The integration of Haystack is on track, and we continue to expect to introduce our first MRD test in early 2024. We intend to launch this test from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas, where we also recently introduced our solid tumor expanded panel for tumor sequencing and therapy monitoring.  I'd like to say a little more about our M&A strategy. Haystack is a capabilities acquisition. And as we've said, it will initially be dilutive for earnings per share. However, our primary focus in M&A continues to be on traditional hospital outreach purchases and tuck-in lab deals that are accretive to earnings in the first year.  To underscore what I said earlier, our M&A pipeline is robust as hospital systems faced continued margin pressures due to labor challenges and a shift from inpatient to outpatient care.  Turning to operational and productivity improvement, our Invigorate program is well on its way to delivering our 3% annual productivity savings target. As we discussed at Investor Day, Invigorate includes deploying automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service. In the quarter, we implemented our automated microbiology solution in Lenexa, Kansas. Next up is Lewisville, Texas. When complete, 4 of our major laboratories will use automated microbiology lines with embedded artificial intelligence identifying positive and negative cases leading to improved quality and productivity.  We are also excited by results of a pilot in our Clifton lab that showed AI speed data collection in specimen processing and expect to implement this AI solution across all of our major regional labs later this year. In genomics, we're utilizing AI in bioinformatics to improve and speed variant classification and prioritization. These are just a couple of the many examples of our use of AI and automation to continuously improve our operations.  In addition, we believe generative AI has great potential to deliver insights and content not only to better target and serve customers, but also to create innovations that help standardize our lab operations. We are encouraged by preliminary results of pilots that use generative AI and our customer service center to automate call their sentiment analysis and quality control and in our marketing operations to improve market research and customer targeting.  Now before I turn it over to Sam, I'll close by saying that we always knew 2023 would be a challenging year as we transitioned away from COVID-19 testing and supported the nation's return to care. Our dedicated employees on the front lines and everyone else who supports them, have done a magnificent job of bringing our purpose to life, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. I'm really proud to be leading this Quest Diagnostics' team.  And now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance. Sam?\nSam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.34 billion, down 4.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 9.5% to $2.3 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 88% to $41 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 4.9% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing versus the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base business.  Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew 0.2% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 7.4% versus the prior year as we continue to see a broad-based return to care throughout the quarter. Revenue per requisition declined 4.9% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 2.5% due to more tests per req, changes in test mix and benefits recognized with certain value-based arrangements.  Unit price reimbursement was flat in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $348 million or 14.9% of revenues compared to $388 million or 15.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $389 million or 16.7% of revenues compared to $435 million or 17.7% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, partially offset by growth in the base business. Compared to the first quarter, we made strong progress improving the profitability of the business. Adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points sequentially while total revenues were essentially flat versus Q1.  We also absorbed higher SG&A costs related to an increase in the market value of the obligations in our supplemental deferred comp plan in the second quarter, which lowered adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points. This has no impact on EPS. We continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions. Since last fall, we have taken a series of actions to reduce support costs, which will save more than $100 million this year.  Those savings largely began in Q2, and we're on track with our estimates in the quarter. Frontline employee turnover improved marginally earlier this year, but the pace of improvement has not met our expectations, and it remains well above historical levels. We continue to feel the effects of the tight labor market, which has had an impact on productivity and wages.  Turnover continues to be a drag on productivity despite the strong base business growth. Reported EPS was $2.05 in the quarter compared to $1.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.30 compared to $2.36 last year. Cash from operations year-to-date was $538 million versus $882 million in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income.  Turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.12 billion and $9.22 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.92 billion and $9.02 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be approximately $200 million. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.52 to $7.92 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.50 to $8.90. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.  There are some things to consider for the remainder of the year. We've raised our base business revenue guidance to reflect our strong performance through the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Note that the year-over-year comparison for the base business becomes more difficult in the second half of 2023 as we begin to lap some PLS wins later in the year. Also, we are not expecting demand for respiratory panels to be as strong as we saw in last year's flu season, which could be a headwind to revenue of nearly 100 basis points in the back half.  We expect revenue and adjusted EPS to be more even in the third and fourth quarters, which is a slight departure from our typical earnings seasonality due to the following factors: Unit price reimbursement is expected to improve in the back half. Our CIT business turned profitable in Q2 and is expected to be more accretive to both revenue and earnings as we move throughout the second half of 2023. And cost actions taken throughout the first half of the year will continue to improve the overall profitability of the business.  Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to experience higher frontline turnover and a tight labor market, which has had an impact on productivity and wages. Higher SG&A costs related to our supplemental deferred comp plan also lowered the operating margin by 30 basis points in the first half of 2023, but had no impact on EPS. As a result, our updated guidance reflects an adjusted operating margin of approximately 16.5% for the full year.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.\nJames Davis: Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we had strong base business performance in the second quarter with nearly double-digit revenue growth as our collaborations with health plans, hospitals and physicians enabled us to benefit from strong demand amid a broad return to care.  We made substantial progress improving the profitability of our base business compared to the first quarter and prior year. This was slightly offset by persistently high employee turnover, which weighs on productivity and increases cost. And finally, our updated guidance reflects our expectations for revenue growth and improved profitability in the base business. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to start and ask about kind of the health plan commentary. Is it possible to tease out how much of this growth could be share gain related versus just strong underlying demand and somewhat related, we have heard more discussion about national payers being more active around payment integrity. I was just curious if you're seeing that at all, could that be a positive or negative for Quest?\nJames Davis: Yes. Thanks, Jack. So it's always hard to discern in this industry what is share gain versus demand return to care and things like that. We don't get perfect data on it. But our sense is it's some of both. On the share gain side, we look closely at our growth through each of the commercial payers. And when we see gains that are above and beyond the average and we see the benefits of those programs, those value-based programs that we work with them, which is around leakage. It's around focusing on physicians that are using out-of-network labs, we see the benefits of those programs, and therefore, conclude its share gain. Certainly, there's been some strong return to care.  On the Payment Integrity side, I can tell you that, look, it's a never-ending effort here in Quest Diagnostics to continuously work denials, to make sure that we understand the payer policies, what are the diagnostic that support those policies and then work back through our physician base to make sure that the tests that they're ordering are appropriate tests. So we haven't seen any discernible impact with some of those policies you're referring to. But we work collaboratively with the payers to understand them and then work back with our physician base to try to correct any errors.\nJack Meehan: Super. Sam, one question on margins. Sorry if I missed this. What is the guide now assume for margins for the year? And can you just talk about what you're assuming in terms of the pace of productivity improvement?\nSam Samad: Yes. Thanks, Jack. So we are assuming for the year, operating margins to be at approximately 16.5%. In terms of productivity, you've seen good benefits from our Invigorate program. And we expect those to, if anything, continue for the rest of the year and even accelerate in Q3 and Q4. So we are seeing good momentum on our Invigorate programs. We're seeing the $100 million of SG&A savings that we've talked about. We're seeing those materialize as of the beginning of Q2, and they will continue for the rest of the year as well for a total year impact of $100 million.  On the other side, we are also seeing, as you heard in the prepared remarks, a tough labor and turnover and macro environment. So turnover continues to persist to be higher than we expected, and that's driving pressure also on margins. But we are expecting approximately 16.5% for the year in terms of OM.\nJames Davis: Yes. Jack, I would just add, obviously, you can see the base -- you can see the margin improvement from Q1 to Q2. That comes through pretty clear. You can do the math on the base margin improvements from Q2 of last year to Q2 of this year, when you make the assumptions on the drop-down of the COVID revenue, which you've -- you're in the range with the numbers you've used in the past. So we're really pleased with the base margin improvement from Q2 of last year to Q2 of this year and very pleased with the improvement from Q1 of this year to Q2 of this year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.\nElizabeth Anderson: Congrats on a good quarter. My question is, I realized there was a ton of noise this quarter on the deferred comp and how that nets out. How -- could one -- what is your assumption in terms of what's embedded in your guidance for the back half of the year? I appreciate that it can be different based on what happens to the future stock price. But I just want to understand whether it's sort of continuing the forecast of last year's trajectory into this year or 2Q going forward or what have you?  And then secondarily, how do you think about you mentioned the labor productivity and sort of the still elevated turnover. So how do you think about sort of the cost benefit of analysis of perhaps like investing more in wages or something like that versus the productivity gains that you would -- you could potentially receive from that?\nSam Samad: Okay. Thanks, Liz, and I appreciate the congrats. So let me talk about DCP deferred compensation, and I'll turn to Jim for productivity and some of the trade-offs that you're referring to there. So in terms of DCP, let me just clarify what it is and the impact.  So first of all, the expense that we saw, which impacts SG&A is the -- related to the increase in the market value of obligations in our supplemental deferred comp plan. That does not have an impact on EPS because it is offset on the nonoperating income line with a benefit. So it's a net neutral on EPS, but it does impact operating margin. Sometimes we don't see it materially impact us. It's related to market movements.  This quarter, it impacted us materially to the tune of 30 basis points impact on operating margin percent. So if you exclude that, it would be our operating margin percent would have been 17%. If you compare it to last year, because last year, and this is where it gets maybe a bit more complicated. But last year, we actually had a benefit in terms of expenses on -- related to deferred compensation, plan market value -- the fair market value change. And so compared to last year Q2, it's an impact of 1%.  So actually, if you compare Q2 2023 OM versus Q2 2022 OM, we would have been relatively flat in terms of operating margin percent quarter-over-quarter last year even despite the drop in COVID revenues, a significant drop to the tune of approximately $300 million that we saw year-over-year in terms of COVID revenues.  Now as you look towards the rest of the year, Liz, we don't forecast deferred compensation plan. I mean that's not something that we forecast. We assume it's a net neutral impact, both on the P&L, on EPS and on operating margin. So the impact that we saw in the first half, which is roughly about 50 basis points of operating margin or 30 basis points, I should say, is carried through for the rest of the year. And so that 16.5% full year operating margin is impacted by the DCP in the first half. So that's the best way I can characterize it.\nJames Davis: Yes. And Liz, on the labor front, at Investor Day, we showed a chart that said pre-COVID, our turnover of what we call our frontline roles, which is phlebotomy, logistics, specimen processing, our call centers, was in the 14% range, our total turnover. We showed a chart that said in the fourth quarter, it was upwards of 23%. It's come down modestly in the first part of the year, but still hasn't come down to the levels, obviously, pre-COVID or to where we would like them. Now you're right. It's a trade-off between increasing wage rates and the price -- and the cost you pay for this turnover. We've estimated that each turnover, each person can cost us upwards of $8,000 to $10,000 depending on the role. And that's simply the lost productivity or the time it takes to get somebody from day 1 to as efficient in that role as a person who's been in the role for 2-plus years.  So it's about $8,000 to $10,000 which if you do the math on that, could have upwards of a $20 million impact in the second half of this year. Now we're at the high end of our wage rate guidance that we gave. We said 3% to 4%. We're certainly at that high end. And if we need to make adjustments, we obviously look at the ROI on that. And we're faced with those decisions. And in certain markets, we will make adjustments to get the turnover to a place that we're comfortable with.\nOperator: Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Maybe just to pivot over and ask you about your Health System Business. I think last quarter, you said in aggregate, it was growing about 70%. And this quarter, the press release says it's just under 10%. And I suspect with NewYork-Presbyterian and so forth coming online fully in the back half, it might be even higher than 10%. When you think about your margin targets and what you're shooting for, can you comment on how the growth in that side of the business is impacting margins and the opportunity? And if there's any updated thoughts on the pipeline that you're seeing, maybe give us that as well.\nJames Davis: Yes. Thanks, A.J. Just on the NewYork-Presbyterian book of business, when we buy that outreach book of business, it actually is in our Physician bucket, not our Health System bucket, because it's physician offices, and we build third-party payers for that.  Our Health System business in the quarter was really helped by the PLS side. Our reference book of business was strong as well, but our PLS growth was very, very strong. excited by the 3 deals that we mentioned in the script with Tower Health, Lee Health and Northern Lights being some of the newer ones. So it was -- that generated substantially more growth in the quarter.  Now as we've always said, PLS has slightly lower operating margins than our normal physician office book of business. But we really like the ROIC on that, okay? So it's got a strong return on capital and that's why we continue to do this. So in terms of the outlook, our funnel of opportunities is strong. We hope to have more closed in the second half of this year on both the PLS side as well as new reference wins. So we're optimistic that the Health Systems portion of our business will continue to grow.\nSam Samad: Yes. And one additional comment, A.J. So with regards to the expectations in the second half on PLS, as Jim said, we are seeing strong growth in that business. In the second half, from a year-over-year perspective, we had some big wins in the first half of last year as well that ramped up in the second half of last year. So from a year-over-year perspective, we do lap some of those PLS wins and that mutes our revenue growth to some extent. But we're seeing really great momentum on the PLS side of the business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Sam, again, that 16.5%, is that now the right number to work off in terms of the long-term guide? And you talked about a few of the moving parts, the unit pricing, maybe looking a little better, labor hitting it. Any of these things onetime that would wear off? And then on that pricing, I know you guys negotiate kind of 1/4 of the contracts annually. Can you just talk about the pricing environment at the moment?\nSam Samad: Yes. No, it's -- so the 16.5% would be the launching point if you're thinking about the 3-year outlook, Patrick, and the improvement that we guided in the -- in Investor Day, which is the 75 to 150 basis point improvement. That's still the right number to be thinking about longer term off of the 16.5% launching point at the end of this year.  In terms of a couple of things that you mentioned, onetime items I think we talked about the DCP, which was more significant in Q2 and for the first half of the year, maybe you can call that onetime. But although it is recurring, but we don't forecast for it. Sometimes it's a benefit. Sometimes it's a negative in terms of an operating margin percent. Last year, in the first half, it was actually a benefit. This year in the first half, it's a negative.  Pricing environment is very good. It's really good. We're seeing good momentum with the health plan value-based contract arrangements that we have. And we expect the pricing environment actually in the second half, where the pricing benefit in the second half to improve versus the first half.  Now as we think about '24, we've talked about before that PAMA is still an uncertainty. And so until we have more certainty around whether there's another PAMA delay or a SALSA bill that gets passed, there's still some uncertainty there for '24.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\nBrian Tanquilut: Congrats on the quarter. Sam, maybe I'll follow up just on Patrick's question, right? So as I think about your previous comments on 2024 guidance or targets for operating margin, does this push out what you had previously kind of guided to for 2024? And maybe kind of related to that, as I think about the $100 million of corporate savings that you've outlined that began in Q2. I mean is there more to squeeze or is it sort of the target run rate and we're just going to see it flow through the P&L into next year as well?\nSam Samad: Yes. So with regards to -- thank you, Brian, first of all, for the question. So with regards to 24, we didn't guide 24. We gave some long-term targets around what we expect our operating margin to look like over the next 3 years as we continue to execute on productivity improvements, Invigorate and apply cost savings into the business. The $100 million that you referred to, which, by the way, next year will be part of our run rate. So we wouldn't expect to see an improvement year-over-year in '24 versus '23 because we're -- except for maybe 1 quarter.  But I would say the 16.5%, as I mentioned to Patrick, becomes the launching point for the future. And we do expect with continued Invigorate offsetting inflation with the cost reductions in the business that we've applied and now will continue and that are generating the expected improvements, we do expect to drive improvement in our operating margins long term. There is the uncertainty about PAMA, which is what drives the range of either 75 to 150 basis points improvement over the 3 years.\nJames Davis: Yes. Then in terms of the cost take out $100 million. Look, we're always looking to be the most efficient we can and obviously, spend every dollar as wisely as we can. But we're also going to continue to invest in this business. We've made strong investments in CIT. And I think as you heard in our script, it's paying off for us. We've got really nice growth out of that. It's now turned profitable.  The Alzheimer's test that we've brought to market that requires investment, and we're going to continue to invest in that space. We're going to continue to invest in molecular genomics and oncology because we're getting growth in that space. And with the Haystack acquisition, we're going to continue to invest there to try to get the test to market as quickly as possible and build a stronger presence. So we're always going to balance the 2. But we're investing in this business for the future.\nOperator: The next question is from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPhilip Chickering: There's been a big debate among both the corporates and investors on the sustainability of the current trends of utilization. Can you sort of talk about what you're seeing in July and sorry if I missed this, but how much of the 2Q organic growth was sort of organic versus the PLS transactions? And how should we think about organic growth continuing in the back half of the year?\nJames Davis: Yes. So we're optimistic that the growth will continue here. In the second half of the year, July to date has been strong consistent with what we saw in June. We generally don't break apart our PLS growth from the growth in our core business. We've said externally that our PLS growth is -- our PLS business is about a $600 million franchise. We said the health system market grew at 10%, PLS grew north of that, reference grew less than that.  So I think you can get a sense for what that contributes to our total growth. But we're optimistic on the prospects with our health systems. The funnel of PLS opportunities remain strong. Health systems need our help, and we think we've got a great offering that helps meet their needs.\nSam Samad: And Pito, maybe I can give a couple of additional comments on sort of second half versus first half, which is I think, where you're driving at here. So listen, we've had a great first half, close to 10% revenue growth. But as you think about the second half, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, we had some easier compare in the first half versus 2022. Obviously, we were in the midst of COVID, base business was impacted by that. So there was some easier compare in the first half that we don't expect to repeat in the second half.  On the prepared remarks, we talked about the COVID flu panel, which is about a 1% negative impact on growth in the second half, definitely compared to the first half. We talked about lapping some PLS wins, which also has a muting effect on our growth in the second half. So when you factor all of these combined, obviously, you can look at our implied growth in the second half based on guidance and it's well lower than the first half, and it's driven by some of these factors that I just gave you.  In terms of July, we are still seeing higher than our traditional utilization. So we're still encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of utilization in July. So -- but we're being appropriately conservative in the second half in terms of what the utilization would look like.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrea Alfonso with UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: It's Kevin Caliendo. So I guess, if I can just bridge all this, if we just take -- go back to the starting point with 17% and then the operating margin then went to 16.8% with Haystack, now it's 16.5%, and we had this sort of onetime issue in the quarter with DCP, which took that down. But you're also calling out some labor trend issues. Maybe -- is the delta the expectation around the labor cost and churn? Like is there a way to quantify that? And should we expect that to continue going forward? I'm just trying to bridge all of these things and then think about the impact of '24 how we get the sort of margin expansion that was originally expected for '24 with these sort of headwinds that are playing out?\nJames Davis: Yes, Kevin, let me take the labor piece, and then I'll turn it over to Sam here. So on a previous question, we talked about pre-COVID, our attrition rate of our frontline positions was in the 14% range. In December, Q4 it was 23%. The chart we showed at Investor Day in March, it's slightly better than that. We have quantified it. We've said it's about $8,000 to $10,000 per employee. And in the second half of the year, we think it can be upwards of a $20 million impact versus where we would want it to be at this point in the year.  So now, is the labor market is easy? Unemployment rate sits at 3.6% right now. The Fed has signaled that they're trying to actually get the unemployment rate back upwards of up to 4.1%, 4.5%. The interest rates are going to take a notch up again today. So we think there's going to be easing in the markets going forward, but it's hard to predict. And so right now, I think we're being appropriately conservative on the guidance in the second half.\nSam Samad: Yes. And so Kevin, let me give you some commentary around second half versus first half margins and why you should have confidence in the margin outlook that we gave, the approximately 16.5% for the year.  So first of all, and just to remind everybody, in Q2, our margins expanded by 170 basis points sequentially despite an $80 million drop in COVID, roughly $80 million drop in COVID. So we had some great momentum in terms of operating margin.  As we look towards second half versus first half, here are some of the dynamics that you should factor. Our CIT business, which was net dilutive on operating margins in the first half, becomes accretive in the second half. So we expect to see that business -- as we're very encouraged by the momentum and it becomes actually, it's become profitable in Q2, and it's going to be accretive for the second half of the year. Pricing is a net -- also net accretive and will continue to improve in the second half, and it's definitely a step-up from the first half.  SG&A, we started to achieve those $100 million annualized savings in Q2. And so we expect to achieve the remainder in Q3 and Q4, we didn't have that benefit in Q1 of this year. We talked about DCP, and I don't want to focus too much on that, but it was a headwind in the first half, which we don't expect in the second half. Offsetting that is the fact that we have some lower COVID revenues in the second half because right now per our guidance, we're expecting approximately $40 million in the second half, which is definitely well south of the $160 million that we achieved in the first.  So -- but as you look at this momentum of all of these things, plus the ramp-up of Invigorate improvements that we expect to see in the second half -- and yes, there is some Haystack dilution, which is to the tune of about $0.15 to $0.20 for the year. But as you look at all of these factors, we are very confident about the ability to achieve the outlook that we gave in terms of operating margins.\nJames Davis: Kevin, the last thing I'd add is when you think about price in this business, we tend to always think about commercial payers, Medicare and Medicaid. You have to remember that there's another $2.5 billion on an annual basis where we price directly to Health Systems, to Physicians. And then we have $800 million worth of other businesses between employer solutions, our drug testing business, our wellness business, and our ExamOne business, which serves life insurance companies.  So we are getting price in those segments of our business. And as Sam indicated, our price performance will be better in the second half than it was in the first half primarily from the lift we're getting on that side of our portfolio.\nOperator: And our next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: I just want to go back to your earlier comments around value-based care where you talked about leakage out-of-network opportunities. But can you maybe just talk about how you see this over time and how you see the evolution of value-based care as it pertains to lab. Is this a margin-enhancing opportunity or just more of a volume opportunity? One, how do I think about that? And then just secondly, I've heard you talk about the pipeline of Health Systems. Is there any way to size what that current pipeline looks like?\nJames Davis: Yes. So on the first question, I just want to make sure we're not confusing terminology here, value-based care and value-based incentives. So when we talk about value-based care, these are generally arrangements where Medicare has put lives directly into these ACO reach programs for Medicare Advantage plans delegate lives into large integrated physician groups.  Now in both of those situations, we are contracting directly with these ACO REACH organizations and directly with these large physician groups. And we believe that those value-based care programs that Medicare and Medicare Advantage are driving are very good for the lab business because generally, they delegate lives at a fixed price, and in fact, labs become much more useful in terms of helping physicians ensure that diseases and conditions do not progress. So we feel good about that.  I think what we're generally -- when we talk about the health plans and we talk about these things called value-based incentives. So these are programs that we structure with the health plans to help them reduce leakage to out-of-network labs and to help us redirect requisitions that are flowing into more expensive health system laboratories and have those requisitions flow directly into Quest Diagnostics.  So when we are successful in those efforts, there can be value-based incentives that we earn when we help them earn the -- when we achieve those targets of reducing leakage and moving work from higher-priced hospital labs into independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. So we seek to do more of both of those programs, value-based care programs with ACO REACH and these value-based incentive programs with our large payers.\nOperator: And our last question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird.\nEric Coldwell: I have two. First one, a bit higher level, more strategic. So United Healthcare Preferred Lab Network was updated in July. I saw that they removed Mayo, but were there any other notable changes in that contract or your relationship there? And then broadly on that same topic, what's the outlook for other MCO opportunities to narrow networks or move the National Labs like you and LabCorp into, say, more preferred roles? Are there opportunities being discussed in the market today?\nJames Davis: Yes. So on the first part of your question, we did not note any other notable changes with respect to the preferred lab network. We still remain part of that preferred plan network, and that's our plan going forward. In terms of narrowing networks, when we speak to all our commercial payers, we always think it's better, from their perspective, to have both independent labs in network that actually improves their ability to make sure that requisitions are going to lower cost, lower price environments, which is good for the payer. It's good for the employer, and it's good for the patient. And so we don't see any change in that trend to narrow networks that restrict access to independent laboratories.  Now having said that, there's laboratories that play on the fringe that could be expensive single-type test environments. And I think the payers are always looking at specialty labs versus independent labs that can do some of that specialty work as well.\nEric Coldwell: Okay. My other question, and I apologize if I think you got close to answering this a few times, and I've been toggling a couple of events this morning. But did you quantify or could you quantify the reduction in investment spending seen year-over-year in the second quarter and also the portion of the incremental $100 million plus cost action that you actually captured in 2Q. So we have a sense on what's left for the rest of the year.\nSam Samad: Yes. Sure, Eric. So no, we didn't quantify the reduction in investment spend. We did have lower investment spend in Q2 versus Q2 of last year, but we haven't quantified how much it is.  With regards to the SG&A benefits and the $100 million, I think the assumption that you can make is it's about 1/3 of that $100 million that was realized in Q2 and we expect the same to occur in Q3 and Q4.\nJames Davis: Yes. I just want to remind, we're going to continue to invest for growth in this business. As we mentioned, again in the script, we've invested in CIT, and we're really starting to see the fruits of that investment. We look at a metric called return on ad spend, it's now positive. So we're going to continue to invest there because we believe it's driving growth, and it's now driving profitable growth.  We talked about our Alzheimer's portfolio of tests. We're going to continue to invest in that area. These blood-based tests, we have the AB42, 40 test up and running. We have the ApoE up and running. These are blood-based tests. These are going to be more useful than CSF or PET scans and less costly to the environment.  We're going to continue to invest in the molecular side of our business. We're going to continue to invest in the oncology business. And that's going to -- all of these things are going to position us for the higher growth segments of the laboratory industry and ensure our long-term outlook.\nOperator: We did have one more question come in. Our last question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is John on for Derik. We talked about this quite a bit, but talked about the focus of the M&A pipeline will be on the deals you've traditionally done before. And it seems you certainly have plenty to come in the coming quarters and you have lots of balance. And of course, you're investing in Alzheimer's portfolio and whatnot. But as you look to launch your first MRD product in 2024, could you talk about potential deals or products that you can -- you see would complement your current oncology portfolio that you don't have in your current internal pipeline?\nJames Davis: Well, we think with the combination of Haystack, which, as you noted, is centered on minimally residual disease testing post cancer diagnosis. And we brought up our own internal assay for therapy selection. So from a therapy monitoring and therapy selection standpoint, we believe we're very well positioned for future growth. We continue to invest on the genetics side of our business, hereditary genetics, genetic offerings for diagnostic purposes and then the family planning and prenatal genetics is also an area that continues to receive focus.  So we believe we're well positioned on the cancer side. We continue to make some investments on the genetic side and that's where the -- we think we're well positioned. Now again, our focus right now, we'll continue to focus on hospital outreach deals and other small tuck-ins that are accretive to our business.\nOperator: That was our last question.\nJames Davis: All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We -- again, I believe we had a strong quarter here. The outlook for the second half. We've taken up our revenue guidance, feel good about that, and thank you for supporting Quest Diagnostics. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call.

            "name": "Sam Samad",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.34 billion, down 4.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 9.5% to $2.3 billion while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 88% to $41 million. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services declined 4.9% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing versus the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base business.  Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, grew 0.2% versus the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 50 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 7.4% versus the prior year as we continue to see a broad-based return to care throughout the quarter. Revenue per requisition declined 4.9% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 2.5% due to more tests per req, changes in test mix and benefits recognized with certain value-based arrangements.  Unit price reimbursement was flat in the quarter, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $348 million or 14.9% of revenues compared to $388 million or 15.8% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $389 million or 16.7% of revenues compared to $435 million or 17.7% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, partially offset by growth in the base business. Compared to the first quarter, we made strong progress improving the profitability of the business. Adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points sequentially while total revenues were essentially flat versus Q1.  We also absorbed higher SG&A costs related to an increase in the market value of the obligations in our supplemental deferred comp plan in the second quarter, which lowered adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points. This has no impact on EPS. We continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions. Since last fall, we have taken a series of actions to reduce support costs, which will save more than $100 million this year.  Those savings largely began in Q2, and we're on track with our estimates in the quarter. Frontline employee turnover improved marginally earlier this year, but the pace of improvement has not met our expectations, and it remains well above historical levels. We continue to feel the effects of the tight labor market, which has had an impact on productivity and wages.  Turnover continues to be a drag on productivity despite the strong base business growth. Reported EPS was $2.05 in the quarter compared to $1.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.30 compared to $2.36 last year. Cash from operations year-to-date was $538 million versus $882 million in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income.  Turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $9.12 billion and $9.22 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.92 billion and $9.02 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be approximately $200 million. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.52 to $7.92 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.50 to $8.90. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million.  There are some things to consider for the remainder of the year. We've raised our base business revenue guidance to reflect our strong performance through the first half and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Note that the year-over-year comparison for the base business becomes more difficult in the second half of 2023 as we begin to lap some PLS wins later in the year. Also, we are not expecting demand for respiratory panels to be as strong as we saw in last year's flu season, which could be a headwind to revenue of nearly 100 basis points in the back half.  We expect revenue and adjusted EPS to be more even in the third and fourth quarters, which is a slight departure from our typical earnings seasonality due to the following factors: Unit price reimbursement is expected to improve in the back half. Our CIT business turned profitable in Q2 and is expected to be more accretive to both revenue and earnings as we move throughout the second half of 2023. And cost actions taken throughout the first half of the year will continue to improve the overall profitability of the business.  Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to experience higher frontline turnover and a tight labor market, which has had an impact on productivity and wages. Higher SG&A costs related to our supplemental deferred comp plan also lowered the operating margin by 30 basis points in the first half of 2023, but had no impact on EPS. As a result, our updated guidance reflects an adjusted operating margin of approximately 16.5% for the full year.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Yes. Thanks, Jack. So we are assuming for the year, operating margins to be at approximately 16.5%. In terms of productivity, you've seen good benefits from our Invigorate program. And we expect those to, if anything, continue for the rest of the year and even accelerate in Q3 and Q4. So we are seeing good momentum on our Invigorate programs. We're seeing the $100 million of SG&A savings that we've talked about. We're seeing those materialize as of the beginning of Q2, and they will continue for the rest of the year as well for a total year impact of $100 million.  On the other side, we are also seeing, as you heard in the prepared remarks, a tough labor and turnover and macro environment. So turnover continues to persist to be higher than we expected, and that's driving pressure also on margins. But we are expecting approximately 16.5% for the year in terms of OM. Okay. Thanks, Liz, and I appreciate the congrats. So let me talk about DCP deferred compensation, and I'll turn to Jim for productivity and some of the trade-offs that you're referring to there. So in terms of DCP, let me just clarify what it is and the impact.  So first of all, the expense that we saw, which impacts SG&A is the -- related to the increase in the market value of obligations in our supplemental deferred comp plan. That does not have an impact on EPS because it is offset on the nonoperating income line with a benefit. So it's a net neutral on EPS, but it does impact operating margin. Sometimes we don't see it materially impact us. It's related to market movements.  This quarter, it impacted us materially to the tune of 30 basis points impact on operating margin percent. So if you exclude that, it would be our operating margin percent would have been 17%. If you compare it to last year, because last year, and this is where it gets maybe a bit more complicated. But last year, we actually had a benefit in terms of expenses on -- related to deferred compensation, plan market value -- the fair market value change. And so compared to last year Q2, it's an impact of 1%.  So actually, if you compare Q2 2023 OM versus Q2 2022 OM, we would have been relatively flat in terms of operating margin percent quarter-over-quarter last year even despite the drop in COVID revenues, a significant drop to the tune of approximately $300 million that we saw year-over-year in terms of COVID revenues.  Now as you look towards the rest of the year, Liz, we don't forecast deferred compensation plan. I mean that's not something that we forecast. We assume it's a net neutral impact, both on the P&L, on EPS and on operating margin. So the impact that we saw in the first half, which is roughly about 50 basis points of operating margin or 30 basis points, I should say, is carried through for the rest of the year. And so that 16.5% full year operating margin is impacted by the DCP in the first half. So that's the best way I can characterize it. Yes. And one additional comment, A.J. So with regards to the expectations in the second half on PLS, as Jim said, we are seeing strong growth in that business. In the second half, from a year-over-year perspective, we had some big wins in the first half of last year as well that ramped up in the second half of last year. So from a year-over-year perspective, we do lap some of those PLS wins and that mutes our revenue growth to some extent. But we're seeing really great momentum on the PLS side of the business. Yes. No, it's -- so the 16.5% would be the launching point if you're thinking about the 3-year outlook, Patrick, and the improvement that we guided in the -- in Investor Day, which is the 75 to 150 basis point improvement. That's still the right number to be thinking about longer term off of the 16.5% launching point at the end of this year.  In terms of a couple of things that you mentioned, onetime items I think we talked about the DCP, which was more significant in Q2 and for the first half of the year, maybe you can call that onetime. But although it is recurring, but we don't forecast for it. Sometimes it's a benefit. Sometimes it's a negative in terms of an operating margin percent. Last year, in the first half, it was actually a benefit. This year in the first half, it's a negative.  Pricing environment is very good. It's really good. We're seeing good momentum with the health plan value-based contract arrangements that we have. And we expect the pricing environment actually in the second half, where the pricing benefit in the second half to improve versus the first half.  Now as we think about '24, we've talked about before that PAMA is still an uncertainty. And so until we have more certainty around whether there's another PAMA delay or a SALSA bill that gets passed, there's still some uncertainty there for '24. Yes. So with regards to -- thank you, Brian, first of all, for the question. So with regards to 24, we didn't guide 24. We gave some long-term targets around what we expect our operating margin to look like over the next 3 years as we continue to execute on productivity improvements, Invigorate and apply cost savings into the business. The $100 million that you referred to, which, by the way, next year will be part of our run rate. So we wouldn't expect to see an improvement year-over-year in '24 versus '23 because we're -- except for maybe 1 quarter.  But I would say the 16.5%, as I mentioned to Patrick, becomes the launching point for the future. And we do expect with continued Invigorate offsetting inflation with the cost reductions in the business that we've applied and now will continue and that are generating the expected improvements, we do expect to drive improvement in our operating margins long term. There is the uncertainty about PAMA, which is what drives the range of either 75 to 150 basis points improvement over the 3 years. And Pito, maybe I can give a couple of additional comments on sort of second half versus first half, which is I think, where you're driving at here. So listen, we've had a great first half, close to 10% revenue growth. But as you think about the second half, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, we had some easier compare in the first half versus 2022. Obviously, we were in the midst of COVID, base business was impacted by that. So there was some easier compare in the first half that we don't expect to repeat in the second half.  On the prepared remarks, we talked about the COVID flu panel, which is about a 1% negative impact on growth in the second half, definitely compared to the first half. We talked about lapping some PLS wins, which also has a muting effect on our growth in the second half. So when you factor all of these combined, obviously, you can look at our implied growth in the second half based on guidance and it's well lower than the first half, and it's driven by some of these factors that I just gave you.  In terms of July, we are still seeing higher than our traditional utilization. So we're still encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of utilization in July. So -- but we're being appropriately conservative in the second half in terms of what the utilization would look like. Yes. And so Kevin, let me give you some commentary around second half versus first half margins and why you should have confidence in the margin outlook that we gave, the approximately 16.5% for the year.  So first of all, and just to remind everybody, in Q2, our margins expanded by 170 basis points sequentially despite an $80 million drop in COVID, roughly $80 million drop in COVID. So we had some great momentum in terms of operating margin.  As we look towards second half versus first half, here are some of the dynamics that you should factor. Our CIT business, which was net dilutive on operating margins in the first half, becomes accretive in the second half. So we expect to see that business -- as we're very encouraged by the momentum and it becomes actually, it's become profitable in Q2, and it's going to be accretive for the second half of the year. Pricing is a net -- also net accretive and will continue to improve in the second half, and it's definitely a step-up from the first half.  SG&A, we started to achieve those $100 million annualized savings in Q2. And so we expect to achieve the remainder in Q3 and Q4, we didn't have that benefit in Q1 of this year. We talked about DCP, and I don't want to focus too much on that, but it was a headwind in the first half, which we don't expect in the second half. Offsetting that is the fact that we have some lower COVID revenues in the second half because right now per our guidance, we're expecting approximately $40 million in the second half, which is definitely well south of the $160 million that we achieved in the first.  So -- but as you look at this momentum of all of these things, plus the ramp-up of Invigorate improvements that we expect to see in the second half -- and yes, there is some Haystack dilution, which is to the tune of about $0.15 to $0.20 for the year. But as you look at all of these factors, we are very confident about the ability to achieve the outlook that we gave in terms of operating margins. Yes. Sure, Eric. So no, we didn't quantify the reduction in investment spend. We did have lower investment spend in Q2 versus Q2 of last year, but we haven't quantified how much it is.  With regards to the SG&A benefits and the $100 million, I think the assumption that you can make is it's about 1/3 of that $100 million that was realized in Q2 and we expect the same to occur in Q3 and Q4."

            "name": "James Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We had strong base business performance in the second quarter with nearly double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Demand for our services remains strong across all regions boosted by the collaborations we have formed with health plans, hospitals and physicians amid an environment where people are returning to care.  We are particularly encouraged by the revenue growth in our base business of nearly 10% from our health system customers. Also in the second quarter, we made substantial progress improving the profitability of our base business compared to the first quarter and prior year despite persistently high employee turnover.  Total adjusted operating margin improved more than 170 basis points compared to the first quarter despite a decline of approximately $80 million in COVID revenue.  This morning, I'll discuss highlights from the second quarter, then Sam will provide more detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2023.  Now let's turn to some of the highlights from the quarter. As we shared at Investor Day, our strategy is to drive growth by continuing to meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers as they navigate the changing landscape in health care. We will enable this growth with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including molecular genomics and oncology.  In addition, acquisitions will continue to be key drivers of our growth. Finally, our strategy includes driving operational improvements across the business with strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service.  So let's review progress we've made in each one of these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered strong base volume growth from physicians, largely through our partnerships with health plans, which have expanded our access to the market. A growing number of these involve value-based arrangements and are generating faster growth and share gains than the traditional relationships. These arrangements position us as a more strategic partner with health plans as we work together on leakage, shared savings and redirection programs.  In addition, NewYork-Presbyterian's recently acquired outreach assets brought us new volume from the physicians.  In Hospital Lab Services, base revenue from health systems grew nearly 10% in the quarter. The Professional Lab Services business had a very strong quarter as we saw solid growth from both new and existing PLS relationships.  We are particularly encouraged by progress with our new PLS partnerships with Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health. As hospitals continue to experience financial challenges, we are here to help whether through professional lab services, reference testing or purchasing the hospital's outreach assets. We are now seeing growing momentum with a significant pipeline of potential deals with large health systems.  In Consumer Health, we had strong base business growth on questhealth.com. We continue to optimize our marketing efforts to target our customers more strategically and now expect consumer-initiated testing to be profitable through the balance of 2023.  Also during the quarter, we launched Genetic Insights, our first consumer-initiated genetics health test on questhealth.com. This saliva-based test leverages our expertise in Next-Generation Sequencing to analyze 3 dozen genes for inherited risk of conditions ranging from breast and colon cancer through carrier status for cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs. We are encouraged by initial demand for this new offering, which adds to our growing test options for health-minded consumers.  As discussed at Investor Day in March, a key pillar of our strategy is to support faster growth across all customer segments through highly specialized advanced diagnostics. These offerings include molecular genomics and oncology tests such as germline testing to assess prenatal and hereditary genetic risk and somatic testing for tumor sequencing.  Advanced Diagnostics also encompasses other key areas, including neurology, women's reproductive health and cardiometabolic health. In neurology, we continue to achieve strong growth from our innovative Quest AD-Detect, portfolio of Alzheimer's blood tests, which help identify early indications of beta amyloid and ApoE status. AD-Detect strongly positions Quest to lead in this rapidly evolving Alzheimer's landscape. Emerging therapies for Alzheimer's represent a new era in treatment and testing for this disease. Like many diseases, early intervention in Alzheimer's may promote better outcomes.  Our AD-Detect portfolio enables accessible and convenient evaluation of Alzheimer's risk potentially at early stages and the monitoring of progression. AD-Detect is now available to our physician customers in the U.S., and we believe it also has the potential to generate strong consumer demand.  In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our cardiometabolic, endocrinology, infectious disease and carrier and prenatal genetic screening services. In June, we completed our acquisition of Haystack Oncology, which positions us to enter the high-growth area of minimal residual disease or MRD testing. Haystack has developed a highly sensitive technique for early detection of residual or recurring cancer with the potential to improve outcomes for patients being treated for cancer.  The integration of Haystack is on track, and we continue to expect to introduce our first MRD test in early 2024. We intend to launch this test from our Oncology Center of Excellence in Lewisville, Texas, where we also recently introduced our solid tumor expanded panel for tumor sequencing and therapy monitoring.  I'd like to say a little more about our M&A strategy. Haystack is a capabilities acquisition. And as we've said, it will initially be dilutive for earnings per share. However, our primary focus in M&A continues to be on traditional hospital outreach purchases and tuck-in lab deals that are accretive to earnings in the first year.  To underscore what I said earlier, our M&A pipeline is robust as hospital systems faced continued margin pressures due to labor challenges and a shift from inpatient to outpatient care.  Turning to operational and productivity improvement, our Invigorate program is well on its way to delivering our 3% annual productivity savings target. As we discussed at Investor Day, Invigorate includes deploying automation and AI to improve quality, efficiency and service. In the quarter, we implemented our automated microbiology solution in Lenexa, Kansas. Next up is Lewisville, Texas. When complete, 4 of our major laboratories will use automated microbiology lines with embedded artificial intelligence identifying positive and negative cases leading to improved quality and productivity.  We are also excited by results of a pilot in our Clifton lab that showed AI speed data collection in specimen processing and expect to implement this AI solution across all of our major regional labs later this year. In genomics, we're utilizing AI in bioinformatics to improve and speed variant classification and prioritization. These are just a couple of the many examples of our use of AI and automation to continuously improve our operations.  In addition, we believe generative AI has great potential to deliver insights and content not only to better target and serve customers, but also to create innovations that help standardize our lab operations. We are encouraged by preliminary results of pilots that use generative AI and our customer service center to automate call their sentiment analysis and quality control and in our marketing operations to improve market research and customer targeting.  Now before I turn it over to Sam, I'll close by saying that we always knew 2023 would be a challenging year as we transitioned away from COVID-19 testing and supported the nation's return to care. Our dedicated employees on the front lines and everyone else who supports them, have done a magnificent job of bringing our purpose to life, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. I'm really proud to be leading this Quest Diagnostics' team.  And now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance. Sam? Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we had strong base business performance in the second quarter with nearly double-digit revenue growth as our collaborations with health plans, hospitals and physicians enabled us to benefit from strong demand amid a broad return to care.  We made substantial progress improving the profitability of our base business compared to the first quarter and prior year. This was slightly offset by persistently high employee turnover, which weighs on productivity and increases cost. And finally, our updated guidance reflects our expectations for revenue growth and improved profitability in the base business. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Yes. Thanks, Jack. So it's always hard to discern in this industry what is share gain versus demand return to care and things like that. We don't get perfect data on it. But our sense is it's some of both. On the share gain side, we look closely at our growth through each of the commercial payers. And when we see gains that are above and beyond the average and we see the benefits of those programs, those value-based programs that we work with them, which is around leakage. It's around focusing on physicians that are using out-of-network labs, we see the benefits of those programs, and therefore, conclude its share gain. Certainly, there's been some strong return to care.  On the Payment Integrity side, I can tell you that, look, it's a never-ending effort here in Quest Diagnostics to continuously work denials, to make sure that we understand the payer policies, what are the diagnostic that support those policies and then work back through our physician base to make sure that the tests that they're ordering are appropriate tests. So we haven't seen any discernible impact with some of those policies you're referring to. But we work collaboratively with the payers to understand them and then work back with our physician base to try to correct any errors. Yes. Jack, I would just add, obviously, you can see the base -- you can see the margin improvement from Q1 to Q2. That comes through pretty clear. You can do the math on the base margin improvements from Q2 of last year to Q2 of this year, when you make the assumptions on the drop-down of the COVID revenue, which you've -- you're in the range with the numbers you've used in the past. So we're really pleased with the base margin improvement from Q2 of last year to Q2 of this year and very pleased with the improvement from Q1 of this year to Q2 of this year. Yes. And Liz, on the labor front, at Investor Day, we showed a chart that said pre-COVID, our turnover of what we call our frontline roles, which is phlebotomy, logistics, specimen processing, our call centers, was in the 14% range, our total turnover. We showed a chart that said in the fourth quarter, it was upwards of 23%. It's come down modestly in the first part of the year, but still hasn't come down to the levels, obviously, pre-COVID or to where we would like them. Now you're right. It's a trade-off between increasing wage rates and the price -- and the cost you pay for this turnover. We've estimated that each turnover, each person can cost us upwards of $8,000 to $10,000 depending on the role. And that's simply the lost productivity or the time it takes to get somebody from day 1 to as efficient in that role as a person who's been in the role for 2-plus years.  So it's about $8,000 to $10,000 which if you do the math on that, could have upwards of a $20 million impact in the second half of this year. Now we're at the high end of our wage rate guidance that we gave. We said 3% to 4%. We're certainly at that high end. And if we need to make adjustments, we obviously look at the ROI on that. And we're faced with those decisions. And in certain markets, we will make adjustments to get the turnover to a place that we're comfortable with. Yes. Thanks, A.J. Just on the NewYork-Presbyterian book of business, when we buy that outreach book of business, it actually is in our Physician bucket, not our Health System bucket, because it's physician offices, and we build third-party payers for that.  Our Health System business in the quarter was really helped by the PLS side. Our reference book of business was strong as well, but our PLS growth was very, very strong. excited by the 3 deals that we mentioned in the script with Tower Health, Lee Health and Northern Lights being some of the newer ones. So it was -- that generated substantially more growth in the quarter.  Now as we've always said, PLS has slightly lower operating margins than our normal physician office book of business. But we really like the ROIC on that, okay? So it's got a strong return on capital and that's why we continue to do this. So in terms of the outlook, our funnel of opportunities is strong. We hope to have more closed in the second half of this year on both the PLS side as well as new reference wins. So we're optimistic that the Health Systems portion of our business will continue to grow. Yes. Then in terms of the cost take out $100 million. Look, we're always looking to be the most efficient we can and obviously, spend every dollar as wisely as we can. But we're also going to continue to invest in this business. We've made strong investments in CIT. And I think as you heard in our script, it's paying off for us. We've got really nice growth out of that. It's now turned profitable.  The Alzheimer's test that we've brought to market that requires investment, and we're going to continue to invest in that space. We're going to continue to invest in molecular genomics and oncology because we're getting growth in that space. And with the Haystack acquisition, we're going to continue to invest there to try to get the test to market as quickly as possible and build a stronger presence. So we're always going to balance the 2. But we're investing in this business for the future. Yes. So we're optimistic that the growth will continue here. In the second half of the year, July to date has been strong consistent with what we saw in June. We generally don't break apart our PLS growth from the growth in our core business. We've said externally that our PLS growth is -- our PLS business is about a $600 million franchise. We said the health system market grew at 10%, PLS grew north of that, reference grew less than that.  So I think you can get a sense for what that contributes to our total growth. But we're optimistic on the prospects with our health systems. The funnel of PLS opportunities remain strong. Health systems need our help, and we think we've got a great offering that helps meet their needs. Yes, Kevin, let me take the labor piece, and then I'll turn it over to Sam here. So on a previous question, we talked about pre-COVID, our attrition rate of our frontline positions was in the 14% range. In December, Q4 it was 23%. The chart we showed at Investor Day in March, it's slightly better than that. We have quantified it. We've said it's about $8,000 to $10,000 per employee. And in the second half of the year, we think it can be upwards of a $20 million impact versus where we would want it to be at this point in the year.  So now, is the labor market is easy? Unemployment rate sits at 3.6% right now. The Fed has signaled that they're trying to actually get the unemployment rate back upwards of up to 4.1%, 4.5%. The interest rates are going to take a notch up again today. So we think there's going to be easing in the markets going forward, but it's hard to predict. And so right now, I think we're being appropriately conservative on the guidance in the second half. Kevin, the last thing I'd add is when you think about price in this business, we tend to always think about commercial payers, Medicare and Medicaid. You have to remember that there's another $2.5 billion on an annual basis where we price directly to Health Systems, to Physicians. And then we have $800 million worth of other businesses between employer solutions, our drug testing business, our wellness business, and our ExamOne business, which serves life insurance companies.  So we are getting price in those segments of our business. And as Sam indicated, our price performance will be better in the second half than it was in the first half primarily from the lift we're getting on that side of our portfolio. Yes. So on the first question, I just want to make sure we're not confusing terminology here, value-based care and value-based incentives. So when we talk about value-based care, these are generally arrangements where Medicare has put lives directly into these ACO reach programs for Medicare Advantage plans delegate lives into large integrated physician groups.  Now in both of those situations, we are contracting directly with these ACO REACH organizations and directly with these large physician groups. And we believe that those value-based care programs that Medicare and Medicare Advantage are driving are very good for the lab business because generally, they delegate lives at a fixed price, and in fact, labs become much more useful in terms of helping physicians ensure that diseases and conditions do not progress. So we feel good about that.  I think what we're generally -- when we talk about the health plans and we talk about these things called value-based incentives. So these are programs that we structure with the health plans to help them reduce leakage to out-of-network labs and to help us redirect requisitions that are flowing into more expensive health system laboratories and have those requisitions flow directly into Quest Diagnostics.  So when we are successful in those efforts, there can be value-based incentives that we earn when we help them earn the -- when we achieve those targets of reducing leakage and moving work from higher-priced hospital labs into independent labs like Quest Diagnostics. So we seek to do more of both of those programs, value-based care programs with ACO REACH and these value-based incentive programs with our large payers. Yes. So on the first part of your question, we did not note any other notable changes with respect to the preferred lab network. We still remain part of that preferred plan network, and that's our plan going forward. In terms of narrowing networks, when we speak to all our commercial payers, we always think it's better, from their perspective, to have both independent labs in network that actually improves their ability to make sure that requisitions are going to lower cost, lower price environments, which is good for the payer. It's good for the employer, and it's good for the patient. And so we don't see any change in that trend to narrow networks that restrict access to independent laboratories.  Now having said that, there's laboratories that play on the fringe that could be expensive single-type test environments. And I think the payers are always looking at specialty labs versus independent labs that can do some of that specialty work as well. Yes. I just want to remind, we're going to continue to invest for growth in this business. As we mentioned, again in the script, we've invested in CIT, and we're really starting to see the fruits of that investment. We look at a metric called return on ad spend, it's now positive. So we're going to continue to invest there because we believe it's driving growth, and it's now driving profitable growth.  We talked about our Alzheimer's portfolio of tests. We're going to continue to invest in that area. These blood-based tests, we have the AB42, 40 test up and running. We have the ApoE up and running. These are blood-based tests. These are going to be more useful than CSF or PET scans and less costly to the environment.  We're going to continue to invest in the molecular side of our business. We're going to continue to invest in the oncology business. And that's going to -- all of these things are going to position us for the higher growth segments of the laboratory industry and ensure our long-term outlook. Well, we think with the combination of Haystack, which, as you noted, is centered on minimally residual disease testing post cancer diagnosis. And we brought up our own internal assay for therapy selection. So from a therapy monitoring and therapy selection standpoint, we believe we're very well positioned for future growth. We continue to invest on the genetics side of our business, hereditary genetics, genetic offerings for diagnostic purposes and then the family planning and prenatal genetics is also an area that continues to receive focus.  So we believe we're well positioned on the cancer side. We continue to make some investments on the genetic side and that's where the -- we think we're well positioned. Now again, our focus right now, we'll continue to focus on hospital outreach deals and other small tuck-ins that are accretive to our business. All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We -- again, I believe we had a strong quarter here. The outlook for the second half. We've taken up our revenue guidance, feel good about that, and thank you for supporting Quest Diagnostics. Have a great day."

Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.\nJim Davis: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re off to a strong start in 2023. Our base business grew double digit compared to prior year, driven by strong performance across physician and health system lab services. This morning we announced the acquisition of Haystack Oncology. Later in my remarks I\u2019ll describe how this transaction is aligned to the molecular genomics and oncology strategy we shared last month at Investor Day and how it positions us well in the fast-growing category of minimal residual disease testing. Now, turning to the first quarter. Total revenues were $2.3 billion. Total base business revenue grew 10%, supported by base business volume growth of nearly 8%. And earnings per share were a $1.78 on a reported basis and $2.4 on an adjusted basis. Now, let's look at some of the highlights from the quarter. The strong volume growth we experienced in our base business across all customer types, points to a continued return to care in the quarter. We saw a faster growth in number of test per requisition across a broad range of clinical test categories. This suggests more people are returning to the healthcare system for routine care after delaying care during the pandemic. Health plan volumes also continue to grow faster than the overall business. This trend is directly related to our ongoing efforts to partner with health plans to actively steer patients to high quality, lower-cost providers like Quest, thereby saving money for the health plan, employers and plan members. During the first quarter, base revenues from health systems grew approximately 7%. At Investor Day, we said this book of business would grow at about 5% to 6% CAGR, and we're having success across the board with new wins in our reference and professional lab services offerings. Some of these highlights include: in February, we announced that we're helping Tower Health in Pennsylvania manage its laboratory supply chain in addition to performing reference testing. Our Northern Light Health PLS relationship began to ramp up in the quarter. Northern Light is a large integrated health system in Maine, where we are providing services for all nine of its hospital labs and its cancer center. We also closed our acquisition of Northern Lights outreach lab assets. Finally, we completed our strategic laboratory services acquisition with NewYork-Presbyterian, with new test volumes starting to flow into our Clifton, New Jersey laboratory earlier this month. This is the third outreach acquisition we completed in the last six months. As we enter the second quarter, our pipeline of new health system business remains strong, including many additional PLS opportunities. Now I'd like to say a few words about our announcement this morning regarding our planned acquisition of Haystack Oncology. Haystack is an early stage oncology company, focused on minimal residual disease, or MRD testing. Haystack has developed a highly sensitive liquid biopsy technology that can detect circulating DNA from residual or recurring tumor cells. The technology was licensed from Johns Hopkins where it was developed by genomics and cancer pioneers. Most patients treated for cancer must be monitored for years following surgery and initial treatment. This is because there\u2019s always the potential that some cancer was missed and may recur. At Investor Day we talked about Quest\u2019s strong position in the mature cancer areas of screening and diagnosis and that we will also play a leading roll in therapy selection with our TSO500 assay. Haystack liquid biopsy technology, combined with our strengths in screening, pathology and sequencing will now position us to play a leading roll in a fast growing MRD category. We expect to focus initially on colorectal, breast and lung cancers and to start generating revenue next year. We are also encouraged by other recent developments in advanced diagnostics. In the area of brain health we saw strong growth which we attribute largely to Quest AD-Detect Alzheimer's blood test. This proprietary test launched last year, helps us assess the risk of Alzheimer's disease. We are now introducing additional tests to help us assess the inherited risk of Alzheimer's and provide personalized recommendations to lower risk. We also saw strong growth in our advanced cardiometabolic portfolio; prenatal genetics, our blood-based tuberculosis screening and hepatitis B and C testing. We are encouraged by the CDC's recent decision to recommend one-time screening for hepatitis B. In consumer health, we continue to add to our test menu with new services, including long COVID and menopause testing. We also generated strong year-over-year volume growth in allergy and general health testing, as consumers utilize our offerings as a complement to the care provided by their physician. In the coming months, we plan to launch a new consumer genetics panel as well. Turning to Invigorate. We are well on our way toward achieving our 3% annual productivity savings target. Here are some recent examples among the many contributors. We are improving the efficiency of our patient services network. In some cases, we're closing smaller draw sites and adding staff to larger, higher volume locations. At the same time, we're making it easier for walk-ins to register and be seen through our schedule at check-in service. We are adding new features to the pre-registration process, which improves both collections and patient convenience. During the pandemic, we relied heavily on third-party logistics to supplement our own team's collections of COVID-19 test and other specimens. COVID-19 volumes have declined and the labor market eases, we are reducing our dependence on these vendors, which will generate savings for our logistics operations. Finally, we're continuing to enhance our labor staffing models across our lab network to reflect post-pandemic total volumes and drive productivity. As we have said before, we continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions. The actions we've taken will start to help margins beginning in the second quarter. Finally, I'd like to give you an update on where we are with Medicare clinical lab fee schedule cuts. As you know, PAMA cuts were suspended for 2023. We strongly support the recent bipartisan reintroduction of the legislation in Congress to fix PAMA through the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act, or SALSA. We are working with our trade association on driving advocacy for SALSA through a campaign to stop lab cuts, aimed at congressional outreach on the importance of lab services. Now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance. Sam?\nSam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.33 billion, down 10.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 10% to $2.21 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 80% and to $119 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 11.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services, versus the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base business. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined 3.8% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing 10 basis points to total volume. In the quarter, total base testing volumes grew 7.9% versus the prior year. Recall, our base testing volumes in the first quarter of last year were negatively impacted by surge in COVID-19 cases due to the spread of the Omicron variant. If we normalize for the impact of the easier comps due to the Omicron surge in Q1 2022, we estimate base volume growth at approximately 4%. COVID-19 testing volumes continued to decline during the first quarter. We resulted approximately 1.3 million molecular tests in the quarter, down approximately 5 million tests versus Q1 of 2022. The Revenue per requisition declined 7.7% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 2.3%, due primarily to more tests per acquisition, as well as positive payer and test mix. Unit price was roughly flat, which was consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the first quarter was $305 million or 13.1% of revenues compared to $513 million or 19.7% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $350 million or 15% of revenues compared to $554 million or 21.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, partially offset by growth in the base business. Reported EPS was $1.78 in the quarter compared to $2.92 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.04 compared to $3.22 last year. Cash from operations was $94 million in the first quarter versus $480 million in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income and an additional payroll cycle during the quarter versus the prior year. Now turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $8.93 billion and $9.08 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.78 billion and $8.88 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $150 million and $200 million. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.52 to $8.02 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.45 to $8.95. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. There are some things to consider for the remainder of the year. We have lowered our COVID-19 revenue guidance, which now assumes very modest COVID-19 revenue following the end of the public health emergency in May. COVID 19 molecular volumes have declined faster than we expected over the last several weeks. And we now expect minimal volume contribution from the retail channel post PHE. We have raised our base business revenue guidance to reflect stronger base volume trends and the recent close of the NewYork-Presbyterian transaction. We expect the Haystack Oncology transaction to close in the second quarter. Our updated EPS guidance reflects the expected dilution from this transaction in 2023. We expect this deal to be modestly dilutive to EPS over the next three years and accretive to earnings by 2026. We anticipate Haystack Oncology to begin contributing revenue in 2024 and to have a positive ROIC by the end of 2025. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.\nJim Davis: Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we're off to a strong start in 2023 and our base business grew double digits compared to prior year. We are excited about our announced acquisition of Haystack Oncology. With Haystack, we expect to build on our strengths in cancer screening and diagnosis to play a leading role in the higher growth areas of MRD detection. And finally, we're well on our way toward generating our targeted 3% Invigorate savings and productivity improvements. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. At the request of the company, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you please fall back in the queue. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes: Great. Thank you. My question is focused on the base volume growth, which was strong. And in your commentary, you talked about health plans that you're gaining more market share there and you are winning more market share, I think you said with, reference labs. So maybe can you give us more detail on that? Is it existing health care partners? Do you have a new health care partner? Is your relationship with existing partners may be changing? And I'm just trying to figure out how much is a return to normal versus maybe actual market share you could be gaining? Thanks.\nJim Davis: Yes. Hey, thanks, Ann and good morning. So our growth in the quarter, again, 10% base revenue growth was strong across all channels, our physician segment and our health systems segment. Now within the health systems segment, we look at our reference business and our PLS business. Our reference business was powered by growth from existing accounts as well as we had several new big wins that, we actually win those deals in previous quarters, but the start-up was in the first quarter. On the PLS side, our professional lab services, our growth at existing site same-store sales was very strong. But we also added, as you know, a couple of new PLS sites, both in the fourth quarter that were ramping up and in the first quarter. Those were Lee Health in Florida, as I mentioned in the script, Tower Health and then Northern Light in Maine, a multi-hospital health system up in Northern Maine continued to wrap up in the first quarter. So broad-based growth, physician business was very strong, health system business strong and PLS certainly helped the average growth rate in the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. This might be one for Sam. Just on the margin side. As we look at the base margins back in COVID, shaking out somewhere around 13%. I guess when you look at the go forward, even getting into next year, kind of approaching that 17% type number. Can you just talk about -- I don't know if it's a bridge or just the progression towards that how you work your way towards that, particularly as COVID continues to come out of the model a little bit. I just want to focus on that base margin piece and how we think about the step up there.\nSam Samad: Sure, Patrick and good morning. Thanks for the question. So listen, we had 15% operating margins in Q1. I'll talk about some of the drivers in terms of -- to your question, looking forward and how we get to that approximately 17% that we guided to on Investor Day, and we're still committed to that approximately 17% number that we guided for 2023. So here are some key drivers. First of all, Q1 margins came in on the base business strong. And, overall, as expected, we had a negative impact from COVID revenues, both coming down more precipitously than expected, but also the mix on COVID. We saw more testing done at the PLS sites that at other sites, which are lower cost for us. But in terms of Q1, came in as expected. As we look forward, we start to see a few things help margins. First of all, keep in mind, Q1 is usually our weakest quarter as well. But as we look forward, you expect Invigorate savings to or productivity improvements to ramp up, and that has already started but will ramp up over the course of the year. We set our SG&A reductions of approximately $100 million will really take effect more so in Q2 onwards. And so, that will help margins going forward as well. We're seeing, as I said, good strong base business growth and volume that's going to help us. We're seeing good tailwind from pricing. Our pricing environment is the best that it's ever been. We're seeing a modest benefit from pricing this year compared to the 50 basis point headwind that we saw last year. And before that, we used to have even more headwind than that. So all of those factors, as you look forward in terms of productivity, in terms of SG&A improvement, in terms of volume growth, give us confidence about getting to that 17%.\nJim Davis: Yes. The last thing I'd add, Patrick, is our test mix in the quarter was strong. Our investments in advanced diagnostics continue to pay off. We saw, as I said in the script, really nice growth in advanced cardiometabolic testing, prenatal genetics, hep B, hep C. So these are all margin accretive types of tests. So we feel good about that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrian Tanquilut: Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter. A question for you guys. As I think about the call out you made on test per req being up in the quarter. Maybe if you can give us some color on what is driving that and how you think that will progress going forward? Yes, that's all. Thank you.\nJim Davis: So I think there's evidence of a strong return to care. So I just said that our advanced testing portfolio was certainly up in the quarter. We also saw just strong growth in routine testing, routine cardiometabolic, lipid panels, chemistry panels and things like that. Generally, general health and wellness visit has high test per req, because you're testing across the entire human body. So I think our test per req were really powered by that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson, Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys, thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk more about your visibility into pricing and contract renewals, particularly with payers this year, should have -- how far along are you in terms of the renewals and sort of what incrementally have you been seeing? Or is it sort of similar to what you called out on current trends? Thank you.\nJim Davis: Sure. So I think as everybody knows, in general, our contracts with commercial payers average three to five years. So on average, every year, we're going to renegotiate about 25% of our health plans contracts. We're now a-third of the way through the year, and we've progressed nicely on two of the contracts that have been renewed. We have a few more to do throughout the rest of the year. So what I would tell you is, look, we have a great value story. Consistently, we're able to move requisitions from high-priced institutions, health systems and out-of-network labs into Quest Diagnostics. And we try to negotiate incentives for doing that. And when we do that work, we get paid incremental value. So these value-based contracts are on the rise. And we certainly make the case around inflation and things like that. But as I've said in the past, we don't lead with that. We lead with the fact that we offer great value, and we want to get paid for that value. So negotiations are going well. We said in the quarter that price was flat, which we haven't been able to say in a long time. Q4, we were down 50 basis points. Q1 we're flat. So we continue to make improvement and expect to make improvement throughout the rest of the year.\nElizabeth Anderson : Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the Haystack acquisition. Can you maybe talk through the process there, why now, why this company? Talk through any -- I know there's some regulatory and commercial milestones this company has coming up? And also, maybe just talk through how we should think about the dilution in terms of modeling it and where would show up through the P&L.\nJim Davis: Yes. So let me just have Sam address the dilution first, and then I'll come back and talk about why Haystack and why now, Sam?\nSam Samad: Yes. So, Kevin, first of all, thanks for the question. So we said this deal will be modestly dilutive this year and modestly dilutive for the next three years and will be actually accretive for us in terms of earnings in 2026. We haven't shared exactly how dilutive of it is for 2023. But let me give you a couple of, maybe, nuggets or qualitative directional comments. First of all, in terms of our overall guidance, as you saw, we kept our guidance midpoint the same. We narrowed the guidance by $0.10 on EPS, so I'm referring here specifically to adjusted EPS. And the drivers of that were, improved base business, which is taking us higher, lower COVID, which is going the other way, and some modest dilution from the Haystack acquisition. But all in all, if you put all those together, we're still at the midpoint of the adjusted EPS guidance that we were last quarter. In terms of going forward, the annualized EPS dilution from Haystack next year is actually less than what we expect to see this year. So it starts to improve. It's -- next year is the peak dilution for the deal. And in 2025, the dilution is lower. So it's actually a year-over-year EPS improvement. And then in 2026, as I said, it's accretive for us from an EPS perspective. ROIC wise, as I said, it turns positive by the end of 2025. And we expect it to have a -- it definitely clears our hurdle for ROIC expectations in the next five years.\nJim Davis: Yes. So Kevin, let me talk a little bit now about why Haystack and why now. So first, as we talked about at Investor Day, when we are looking to close a capability gap, if you will, in our portfolio, the first thing we do is we reach out to our IBD partners. And over the last several years, we've had deep discussions. We know what their road maps are. And we didn't think that was a pathway to follow to get into this space, at least in the next several years, let's just say. Over the last three years, we've had many discussions with many of the players in the MRD space. We got to know Haystack over the last year. We think they have the lowest limit of detection of any MRD assay out there. In terms of just raw numbers, they can detect one part per million, meaning you have 1 million floating dead cells, as they die they release DNA, the fragments of DNA and there's a lot of DNA in your bloodstream and these guys with this assay can find one fragment of cancer DNA per 1 million parts. That is an incredibly low limit of detection. The sensitivity of the assay at Landmark is very, very high, 80% to 90%. And so we think it's a best-in-class assay. The work they've done on some of their preliminary trials, 450 patients across 23 Australian centers. I'd refer you to the New England Journal of Medicine article in June of 2022. So we think it's the right assay, the right time. As you know, CMS is reimbursing for these assays, and we think we can scale it. We think we can drive further commercial reimbursement. The last thing I would say is, look, it is a tumor-informed assay and when you're looking for a needle in a haystack, hence their name, when you're looking for a needle in a haystack, you actually want to know what the needle looks like. And hence, we believe that a tumor-informed assay is a much stronger assay than an uninformed assay.\nSam Samad: One other thing, just to wrap up on the financials. Kevin, back to your question around dilution. I do want to mention, for the longer term, we are committed to the Investor Day guidance that we gave around long-range guidance, which said mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit EPS growth. The Haystack acquisition actually modestly improves on that as well. So I just wanted to provide this for the long-term guidance, given that we just shared at an Investor Day not too long ago\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Wanted to stick with the Haystack deal. Very interesting, great tech, pricing is pretty reasonable with other deals in the space. I had a few more questions for you. First is in terms of coverage, just wanted to confirm, I assume, is the plan to go through Moldex there? Then number two, do you think reimbursement looks similar to other MRD tests on the market? And then finally, can you just comment, are there any royalties attached to the deal? Thank you.\nJim Davis: Yes. So, yes, Jack, first, thanks for the question. Yes, on Moldex absolutely plan to go that route. Look, what we have to do is finish the commercialization of the assay. We'll be doing that for the rest of this year. We plan on bringing the assay up in one of our large oncology testing facilities. As you know, there is limited coverage for Medicare and Medicare Advantage patients, as dictated by CMS. Two companies have coverage for that today. I would also tell you, there's a handful of Blues company -- the Blues plans that are reimbursing for the test. So similar to NIPT -- remember, NIPT started out very high-risk women, very limited coverage. And we, as well some other industry members drove that throughout the commercial payers. And that test is wide open to women today. So that's our plan. On the royalty question, look, as we mentioned in the comments, the -- some of the original IP came out of John Hopkins. I'm not going to disclose royalty payments. But as you can imagine, there's intellectual property that comes with this, and there's modest royalties that will come with it.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErin Wright : Great. Thanks. Two part question. Just first on basic routine testing. Where are we now relative to pre-COVID baseline levels? Are we fully back to normal here? And then on capital deployment, I understand there's a balance of capital deployment dedicated to the innovation assets like Haystack, but how rich is the pipeline now for the tuck-in deals around hospitals, or local players and have you seen any changes in the urgency around those types of deals? Thanks.\nJim Davis: Yes. So our routine testing levels are above pre-COVID levels, whether you look at our volume versus all of 2019 or you look at our volume versus the first two months of 2020, we're substantially above that. So the recovery is no longer really even a topic of discussion for us. In terms of the funnel of opportunities on the health system side, namely outreach deals is stronger than ever. And I think now that COVID is behind us, the deal completion will start to accelerate. So we feel good about what's in the funnel. They generally take a while to negotiate. You got to get a lot of people on board, pathologists on board, referring physicians. But once you get them all on board, it can move quickly.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nKieran Ryan: Hi, there. You've got Kieran Ryan on here for Pito. Thanks for taking the questions. Just going back to margins, I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about FTE wage inflation, hiring and turnover, how that ran in 1Q compared to what you're seeing in the second half of 2022? And then, just kind of how that fits into getting back to that 17% margin next year?\nSam Samad: Yes. So the guidance we gave for the year, we said our wage inflation would be in the 3% to 4% range. No surprises there. We still feel good about that overall guidance that we set for the year. Our turnover rates have improved from Q1 of last year. Sequentially, for most job categories, it improved from Q4 to Q1. And we continue to see the trend back towards a normalized attrition rate. When I say normalized, sort of, pre-COVID levels. It is not yet back to those levels unlike volume, but it is trending in the right direction, and we feel good about where our wage inflation was in the first quarter and for the year.\nJim Davis: Yes. And I'll just mention a couple of things real quick. I mean, productivity in terms of the Invigorate actions that we have, helps also offset that, which is how we get to the margin target that we have. And I think you mentioned, Kieran, the 17% next year, actually, our guidance is to get to approximately 17% this year in terms of operating margin. So I just want to be clear on that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next comes\u2026\nShawn Bevec: Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Brackmann: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to go back to Haystack for a minute and appreciate all the commentary today on that. But can you maybe just sort of talk about any expectations for a halo effect that this can create for you guys commercially. And I guess, just as you sort of think about that, how are you thinking about any changes to the commercial strategy, just between calling on pathologists and then the oncologist here. Thanks.\nJim Davis: Yes. It\u2019s a good question. Absolutely, a halo effect. Remember at Investor Day, we said in 2022, ex-COVID, we had $8.4 billion in revenue. And of that $8.4 billion, $1 billion of that is in the cancer space. And we said about half of that or $0.5 billion is in the screening space, routine screening, PSA, Pap Smear, HPV, some common cancer markers, but we then said that the other $0.5 billion is anatomical pathology. So we have the -- and once we have that specimen, it's only logical for the medical oncologists to start to, once it's declared cancer -- the next question, post surgery is there still cancer cells in this human being, or the next question, if the answer to that is yes, and then there's therapy. The next question is, did the therapy work? Do we still see remnants of DNA from the tumor. So we think this absolutely fits into our overall cancer strategy and Quest Diagnostics today. In particular, again, there is a halo effect. We will own the block, we will own the specimen and doing the testing on that for both treatment monitoring as well as treatment selection, we think, is just a natural. Now, from a commercial standpoint, we have a pretty mature oncology distribution today that calls on pathologists and medical oncologists. And, yes, we are absolutely going to strengthen the team as we finish the commercialization of this assay and to have a more robust channel calling into the medical oncologist space. So good question. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from A.J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe two quick ones here, if I could slip them in. A strong rebound in the base business line. We've talked for a while about the fact that the New York region had not come back as quickly as other regions. Did you see any outsized performance there that's contributing to the strong base business? Or was the strength pretty much across the board geographically. And then you didn't do anything on the buyback front this quarter. I know you've Haystack now and you've got hospital deals. I wondered what's your thought about additional share repurchases as we progress through the year.\nJim Davis: Yes. Thanks, A.J. So, on your first question, I'll let Sam take the second part. Again, 10% revenue growth on the base business in the quarter, 8% volume growth. I mentioned that health systems was 7%. So our physician book of business actually grew higher than that, if you do that math. And the answer is, we saw strong growth across all of our regions. Did the Northeast grow at a faster rate? Slightly faster rate, yes. So we saw maybe a bit of a rebound there. But look, our comparisons now in the Northeast region are with 2022. There's been population shifts that some of that population is just not going to come back to the Northeast. Now, we see a stronger growth -- continued stronger growth in the Southeast and the Southwest, and that very much could represent some population shift that we're seeing in the country. The last thing I'd mention, although it didn't influence our Q1 numbers, we did mention the startup of our NewYork-Presbyterian outreach deal that's going well. It's going to be a strong contributor to growth in the East region and will be a strong contributor to our overall growth for the rest of the year. So Sam, do you want to take that?\nSam Samad: Yes. And thanks, A.J. On the buyback, so what's assumed in our guidance in terms of adjusted EPS is that we will offset equity dilution in terms of share buybacks. So we'll do enough to offset equity dilution. We are still committed to returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. So that's still our commitment. We communicated it on our Investor Day. We're obviously still committed to it. But we also said that we're going to scale share buybacks up and down depending on also the M&A pipeline and the impact that might have on growth and driving our strategy and also our long-term growth. We had -- in the quarter, we talked about -- or at least, recently, we talked about NewYork-Presbyterian and the fact that, that's a $275 million capital deployment. We talked about now today, Haystack and that's an additional capital deployment of $300 million. So we've got good progress here on the M&A front. So that's also why we didn't do any share buyback in Q1.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is John [ph] on for Derek.\nJim Davis: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask about the consumer initiated testing business. in terms of contribution, if you're allowed to say how much contribution you saw monthly in terms of sales and how much of an impact has made on the margins. Just curious if that\u2019s something I should look out for in terms of the margin progression here. Thank you.\nJim Davis: Yes. So we are really happy with our consumer-initiated testing performance in the quarter. It showed nice growth from progressive growth from Q4. And so, I'm going to talk about the growth. COVID obviously declined in that segment of our business as well. The majority of our CIT business now is our routine base business. We saw a nice progression from Q4 to Q1. We are happy with that. We saw a nice progression Q1 to Q1, really nice progression there. We continue to be excited about a couple of growth categories within CIT. Number one, you probably read allergy season has really taken off and taken off early. So seeing some nice growth there. Just our general health and wellness offering in CIT was really strong in the quarter. And we surveyed some of those general health and wellness customers and found some interesting things. One of the main reasons they're coming to Quest and paying out of pocket is because patients were -- consumers, patients were having a hard time getting in to see their physicians. We're hearing about three-month delays to get to see their doctor. So rather than wait to see their doctor and get their lab testing, they just come in, because they want to know. And then finally, I'd say, our STD category continues to exhibit very strong growth. The CDC just declared again several types of STDs, gonorrhoea, syphilis at epidemic levels. They also indicated that 50% of all new cases that they're seeing across the country are aged 15 to 24. And that's a segment that wants to remain anonymous and just pay out of pocket for lots of reasons. Finally, as we've said about margins, our CIP business is going to be less dilutive this year than it was last year. And I think you can assume that each quarter through the year.\nSam Samad: Yes. So, John, just to add to that, it is dilutive in Q1 to margins. But as Jim said, it's going to improve throughout the year. So that's another aspect of why our margins overall improve, although this one is more modest.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, are there any more questions?\nJim Davis: All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining today, some really exciting news here, but let me just summarize. Look, we're off to a really strong start here in 2023. Our base business performed stronger than expected, stronger than we expected in the quarter. We feel really, really good about that. and it's certainly offsetting some of the COVID decline that we saw in the quarter. Second, hopefully, you can tell, we're really excited about the Haystack Oncology. We think the technology is the right technology, but more importantly, it's the right team. We are really impressed with the team that will join Quest Diagnostics. And as you know, in these types of acquisitions, it's not just investing in the technology, we\u2019re really investing in a group of people and a team, and we feel really, really good about that. We feel great about the MRD space and we believe it's starting to mature from both a physician ordering perspective as well as from a reimbursement perspective. And then, finally, we're well on our way to generating the Invigorate savings that are needed to offset wage inflation, and we feel good about the progress we're making there. So, again, thanks for joining in, and we look forward to seeing you out on the road over the next few months and joining us at our next earnings call in July. So thanks for joining, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics First Quarter 2023 Conference Call.

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.33 billion, down 10.7% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 10% to $2.21 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined approximately 80% and to $119 million. Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 11.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services, versus the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by strong growth in our base business. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, declined 3.8% versus the prior year with acquisitions contributing 10 basis points to total volume. In the quarter, total base testing volumes grew 7.9% versus the prior year. Recall, our base testing volumes in the first quarter of last year were negatively impacted by surge in COVID-19 cases due to the spread of the Omicron variant. If we normalize for the impact of the easier comps due to the Omicron surge in Q1 2022, we estimate base volume growth at approximately 4%. COVID-19 testing volumes continued to decline during the first quarter. We resulted approximately 1.3 million molecular tests in the quarter, down approximately 5 million tests versus Q1 of 2022. The Revenue per requisition declined 7.7% versus the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 molecular volume. Base business revenue per req was up 2.3%, due primarily to more tests per acquisition, as well as positive payer and test mix. Unit price was roughly flat, which was consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the first quarter was $305 million or 13.1% of revenues compared to $513 million or 19.7% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $350 million or 15% of revenues compared to $554 million or 21.2% of revenues last year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues, partially offset by growth in the base business. Reported EPS was $1.78 in the quarter compared to $2.92 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.04 compared to $3.22 last year. Cash from operations was $94 million in the first quarter versus $480 million in the prior year period. The decline in operating cash flow was primarily related to lower operating income and an additional payroll cycle during the quarter versus the prior year. Now turning to our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenues are now expected to be between $8.93 billion and $9.08 billion. Base business revenues are expected to be between $8.78 billion and $8.88 billion. COVID-19 testing revenues are expected to be between $150 million and $200 million. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.52 to $8.02 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.45 to $8.95. Cash from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million. There are some things to consider for the remainder of the year. We have lowered our COVID-19 revenue guidance, which now assumes very modest COVID-19 revenue following the end of the public health emergency in May. COVID 19 molecular volumes have declined faster than we expected over the last several weeks. And we now expect minimal volume contribution from the retail channel post PHE. We have raised our base business revenue guidance to reflect stronger base volume trends and the recent close of the NewYork-Presbyterian transaction. We expect the Haystack Oncology transaction to close in the second quarter. Our updated EPS guidance reflects the expected dilution from this transaction in 2023. We expect this deal to be modestly dilutive to EPS over the next three years and accretive to earnings by 2026. We anticipate Haystack Oncology to begin contributing revenue in 2024 and to have a positive ROIC by the end of 2025. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Sure, Patrick and good morning. Thanks for the question. So listen, we had 15% operating margins in Q1. I'll talk about some of the drivers in terms of -- to your question, looking forward and how we get to that approximately 17% that we guided to on Investor Day, and we're still committed to that approximately 17% number that we guided for 2023. So here are some key drivers. First of all, Q1 margins came in on the base business strong. And, overall, as expected, we had a negative impact from COVID revenues, both coming down more precipitously than expected, but also the mix on COVID. We saw more testing done at the PLS sites that at other sites, which are lower cost for us. But in terms of Q1, came in as expected. As we look forward, we start to see a few things help margins. First of all, keep in mind, Q1 is usually our weakest quarter as well. But as we look forward, you expect Invigorate savings to or productivity improvements to ramp up, and that has already started but will ramp up over the course of the year. We set our SG&A reductions of approximately $100 million will really take effect more so in Q2 onwards. And so, that will help margins going forward as well. We're seeing, as I said, good strong base business growth and volume that's going to help us. We're seeing good tailwind from pricing. Our pricing environment is the best that it's ever been. We're seeing a modest benefit from pricing this year compared to the 50 basis point headwind that we saw last year. And before that, we used to have even more headwind than that. So all of those factors, as you look forward in terms of productivity, in terms of SG&A improvement, in terms of volume growth, give us confidence about getting to that 17%. Yes. So, Kevin, first of all, thanks for the question. So we said this deal will be modestly dilutive this year and modestly dilutive for the next three years and will be actually accretive for us in terms of earnings in 2026. We haven't shared exactly how dilutive of it is for 2023. But let me give you a couple of, maybe, nuggets or qualitative directional comments. First of all, in terms of our overall guidance, as you saw, we kept our guidance midpoint the same. We narrowed the guidance by $0.10 on EPS, so I'm referring here specifically to adjusted EPS. And the drivers of that were, improved base business, which is taking us higher, lower COVID, which is going the other way, and some modest dilution from the Haystack acquisition. But all in all, if you put all those together, we're still at the midpoint of the adjusted EPS guidance that we were last quarter. In terms of going forward, the annualized EPS dilution from Haystack next year is actually less than what we expect to see this year. So it starts to improve. It's -- next year is the peak dilution for the deal. And in 2025, the dilution is lower. So it's actually a year-over-year EPS improvement. And then in 2026, as I said, it's accretive for us from an EPS perspective. ROIC wise, as I said, it turns positive by the end of 2025. And we expect it to have a -- it definitely clears our hurdle for ROIC expectations in the next five years. One other thing, just to wrap up on the financials. Kevin, back to your question around dilution. I do want to mention, for the longer term, we are committed to the Investor Day guidance that we gave around long-range guidance, which said mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit EPS growth. The Haystack acquisition actually modestly improves on that as well. So I just wanted to provide this for the long-term guidance, given that we just shared at an Investor Day not too long ago Yes. So the guidance we gave for the year, we said our wage inflation would be in the 3% to 4% range. No surprises there. We still feel good about that overall guidance that we set for the year. Our turnover rates have improved from Q1 of last year. Sequentially, for most job categories, it improved from Q4 to Q1. And we continue to see the trend back towards a normalized attrition rate. When I say normalized, sort of, pre-COVID levels. It is not yet back to those levels unlike volume, but it is trending in the right direction, and we feel good about where our wage inflation was in the first quarter and for the year. Yes. And thanks, A.J. On the buyback, so what's assumed in our guidance in terms of adjusted EPS is that we will offset equity dilution in terms of share buybacks. So we'll do enough to offset equity dilution. We are still committed to returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. So that's still our commitment. We communicated it on our Investor Day. We're obviously still committed to it. But we also said that we're going to scale share buybacks up and down depending on also the M&A pipeline and the impact that might have on growth and driving our strategy and also our long-term growth. We had -- in the quarter, we talked about -- or at least, recently, we talked about NewYork-Presbyterian and the fact that, that's a $275 million capital deployment. We talked about now today, Haystack and that's an additional capital deployment of $300 million. So we've got good progress here on the M&A front. So that's also why we didn't do any share buyback in Q1. Yes. So, John, just to add to that, it is dilutive in Q1 to margins. But as Jim said, it's going to improve throughout the year. So that's another aspect of why our margins overall improve, although this one is more modest."

            "name": "Jim Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. We're off to a strong start in 2023. Our base business grew double digit compared to prior year, driven by strong performance across physician and health system lab services. This morning we announced the acquisition of Haystack Oncology. Later in my remarks I'll describe how this transaction is aligned to the molecular genomics and oncology strategy we shared last month at Investor Day and how it positions us well in the fast-growing category of minimal residual disease testing. Now, turning to the first quarter. Total revenues were $2.3 billion. Total base business revenue grew 10%, supported by base business volume growth of nearly 8%. And earnings per share were a $1.78 on a reported basis and $2.4 on an adjusted basis. Now, let's look at some of the highlights from the quarter. The strong volume growth we experienced in our base business across all customer types, points to a continued return to care in the quarter. We saw a faster growth in number of test per requisition across a broad range of clinical test categories. This suggests more people are returning to the healthcare system for routine care after delaying care during the pandemic. Health plan volumes also continue to grow faster than the overall business. This trend is directly related to our ongoing efforts to partner with health plans to actively steer patients to high quality, lower-cost providers like Quest, thereby saving money for the health plan, employers and plan members. During the first quarter, base revenues from health systems grew approximately 7%. At Investor Day, we said this book of business would grow at about 5% to 6% CAGR, and we're having success across the board with new wins in our reference and professional lab services offerings. Some of these highlights include: in February, we announced that we're helping Tower Health in Pennsylvania manage its laboratory supply chain in addition to performing reference testing. Our Northern Light Health PLS relationship began to ramp up in the quarter. Northern Light is a large integrated health system in Maine, where we are providing services for all nine of its hospital labs and its cancer center. We also closed our acquisition of Northern Lights outreach lab assets. Finally, we completed our strategic laboratory services acquisition with NewYork-Presbyterian, with new test volumes starting to flow into our Clifton, New Jersey laboratory earlier this month. This is the third outreach acquisition we completed in the last six months. As we enter the second quarter, our pipeline of new health system business remains strong, including many additional PLS opportunities. Now I'd like to say a few words about our announcement this morning regarding our planned acquisition of Haystack Oncology. Haystack is an early stage oncology company, focused on minimal residual disease, or MRD testing. Haystack has developed a highly sensitive liquid biopsy technology that can detect circulating DNA from residual or recurring tumor cells. The technology was licensed from Johns Hopkins where it was developed by genomics and cancer pioneers. Most patients treated for cancer must be monitored for years following surgery and initial treatment. This is because there's always the potential that some cancer was missed and may recur. At Investor Day we talked about Quest's strong position in the mature cancer areas of screening and diagnosis and that we will also play a leading roll in therapy selection with our TSO500 assay. Haystack liquid biopsy technology, combined with our strengths in screening, pathology and sequencing will now position us to play a leading roll in a fast growing MRD category. We expect to focus initially on colorectal, breast and lung cancers and to start generating revenue next year. We are also encouraged by other recent developments in advanced diagnostics. In the area of brain health we saw strong growth which we attribute largely to Quest AD-Detect Alzheimer's blood test. This proprietary test launched last year, helps us assess the risk of Alzheimer's disease. We are now introducing additional tests to help us assess the inherited risk of Alzheimer's and provide personalized recommendations to lower risk. We also saw strong growth in our advanced cardiometabolic portfolio; prenatal genetics, our blood-based tuberculosis screening and hepatitis B and C testing. We are encouraged by the CDC's recent decision to recommend one-time screening for hepatitis B. In consumer health, we continue to add to our test menu with new services, including long COVID and menopause testing. We also generated strong year-over-year volume growth in allergy and general health testing, as consumers utilize our offerings as a complement to the care provided by their physician. In the coming months, we plan to launch a new consumer genetics panel as well. Turning to Invigorate. We are well on our way toward achieving our 3% annual productivity savings target. Here are some recent examples among the many contributors. We are improving the efficiency of our patient services network. In some cases, we're closing smaller draw sites and adding staff to larger, higher volume locations. At the same time, we're making it easier for walk-ins to register and be seen through our schedule at check-in service. We are adding new features to the pre-registration process, which improves both collections and patient convenience. During the pandemic, we relied heavily on third-party logistics to supplement our own team's collections of COVID-19 test and other specimens. COVID-19 volumes have declined and the labor market eases, we are reducing our dependence on these vendors, which will generate savings for our logistics operations. Finally, we're continuing to enhance our labor staffing models across our lab network to reflect post-pandemic total volumes and drive productivity. As we have said before, we continue to closely manage the cost of our corporate and support functions. The actions we've taken will start to help margins beginning in the second quarter. Finally, I'd like to give you an update on where we are with Medicare clinical lab fee schedule cuts. As you know, PAMA cuts were suspended for 2023. We strongly support the recent bipartisan reintroduction of the legislation in Congress to fix PAMA through the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act, or SALSA. We are working with our trade association on driving advocacy for SALSA through a campaign to stop lab cuts, aimed at congressional outreach on the importance of lab services. Now I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our updated 2023 guidance. Sam? Thanks, Sam. To summarize, we're off to a strong start in 2023 and our base business grew double digits compared to prior year. We are excited about our announced acquisition of Haystack Oncology. With Haystack, we expect to build on our strengths in cancer screening and diagnosis to play a leading role in the higher growth areas of MRD detection. And finally, we're well on our way toward generating our targeted 3% Invigorate savings and productivity improvements. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Yes. Hey, thanks, Ann and good morning. So our growth in the quarter, again, 10% base revenue growth was strong across all channels, our physician segment and our health systems segment. Now within the health systems segment, we look at our reference business and our PLS business. Our reference business was powered by growth from existing accounts as well as we had several new big wins that, we actually win those deals in previous quarters, but the start-up was in the first quarter. On the PLS side, our professional lab services, our growth at existing site same-store sales was very strong. But we also added, as you know, a couple of new PLS sites, both in the fourth quarter that were ramping up and in the first quarter. Those were Lee Health in Florida, as I mentioned in the script, Tower Health and then Northern Light in Maine, a multi-hospital health system up in Northern Maine continued to wrap up in the first quarter. So broad-based growth, physician business was very strong, health system business strong and PLS certainly helped the average growth rate in the quarter. Yes. The last thing I'd add, Patrick, is our test mix in the quarter was strong. Our investments in advanced diagnostics continue to pay off. We saw, as I said in the script, really nice growth in advanced cardiometabolic testing, prenatal genetics, hep B, hep C. So these are all margin accretive types of tests. So we feel good about that. So I think there's evidence of a strong return to care. So I just said that our advanced testing portfolio was certainly up in the quarter. We also saw just strong growth in routine testing, routine cardiometabolic, lipid panels, chemistry panels and things like that. Generally, general health and wellness visit has high test per req, because you're testing across the entire human body. So I think our test per req were really powered by that. Sure. So I think as everybody knows, in general, our contracts with commercial payers average three to five years. So on average, every year, we're going to renegotiate about 25% of our health plans contracts. We're now a-third of the way through the year, and we've progressed nicely on two of the contracts that have been renewed. We have a few more to do throughout the rest of the year. So what I would tell you is, look, we have a great value story. Consistently, we're able to move requisitions from high-priced institutions, health systems and out-of-network labs into Quest Diagnostics. And we try to negotiate incentives for doing that. And when we do that work, we get paid incremental value. So these value-based contracts are on the rise. And we certainly make the case around inflation and things like that. But as I've said in the past, we don't lead with that. We lead with the fact that we offer great value, and we want to get paid for that value. So negotiations are going well. We said in the quarter that price was flat, which we haven't been able to say in a long time. Q4, we were down 50 basis points. Q1 we're flat. So we continue to make improvement and expect to make improvement throughout the rest of the year. Yes. So let me just have Sam address the dilution first, and then I'll come back and talk about why Haystack and why now, Sam? Yes. So Kevin, let me talk a little bit now about why Haystack and why now. So first, as we talked about at Investor Day, when we are looking to close a capability gap, if you will, in our portfolio, the first thing we do is we reach out to our IBD partners. And over the last several years, we've had deep discussions. We know what their road maps are. And we didn't think that was a pathway to follow to get into this space, at least in the next several years, let's just say. Over the last three years, we've had many discussions with many of the players in the MRD space. We got to know Haystack over the last year. We think they have the lowest limit of detection of any MRD assay out there. In terms of just raw numbers, they can detect one part per million, meaning you have 1 million floating dead cells, as they die they release DNA, the fragments of DNA and there's a lot of DNA in your bloodstream and these guys with this assay can find one fragment of cancer DNA per 1 million parts. That is an incredibly low limit of detection. The sensitivity of the assay at Landmark is very, very high, 80% to 90%. And so we think it's a best-in-class assay. The work they've done on some of their preliminary trials, 450 patients across 23 Australian centers. I'd refer you to the New England Journal of Medicine article in June of 2022. So we think it's the right assay, the right time. As you know, CMS is reimbursing for these assays, and we think we can scale it. We think we can drive further commercial reimbursement. The last thing I would say is, look, it is a tumor-informed assay and when you're looking for a needle in a haystack, hence their name, when you're looking for a needle in a haystack, you actually want to know what the needle looks like. And hence, we believe that a tumor-informed assay is a much stronger assay than an uninformed assay. Yes. So, yes, Jack, first, thanks for the question. Yes, on Moldex absolutely plan to go that route. Look, what we have to do is finish the commercialization of the assay. We'll be doing that for the rest of this year. We plan on bringing the assay up in one of our large oncology testing facilities. As you know, there is limited coverage for Medicare and Medicare Advantage patients, as dictated by CMS. Two companies have coverage for that today. I would also tell you, there's a handful of Blues company -- the Blues plans that are reimbursing for the test. So similar to NIPT -- remember, NIPT started out very high-risk women, very limited coverage. And we, as well some other industry members drove that throughout the commercial payers. And that test is wide open to women today. So that's our plan. On the royalty question, look, as we mentioned in the comments, the -- some of the original IP came out of John Hopkins. I'm not going to disclose royalty payments. But as you can imagine, there's intellectual property that comes with this, and there's modest royalties that will come with it. Yes. So our routine testing levels are above pre-COVID levels, whether you look at our volume versus all of 2019 or you look at our volume versus the first two months of 2020, we're substantially above that. So the recovery is no longer really even a topic of discussion for us. In terms of the funnel of opportunities on the health system side, namely outreach deals is stronger than ever. And I think now that COVID is behind us, the deal completion will start to accelerate. So we feel good about what's in the funnel. They generally take a while to negotiate. You got to get a lot of people on board, pathologists on board, referring physicians. But once you get them all on board, it can move quickly. Yes. And I'll just mention a couple of things real quick. I mean, productivity in terms of the Invigorate actions that we have, helps also offset that, which is how we get to the margin target that we have. And I think you mentioned, Kieran, the 17% next year, actually, our guidance is to get to approximately 17% this year in terms of operating margin. So I just want to be clear on that. Yes. It's a good question. Absolutely, a halo effect. Remember at Investor Day, we said in 2022, ex-COVID, we had $8.4 billion in revenue. And of that $8.4 billion, $1 billion of that is in the cancer space. And we said about half of that or $0.5 billion is in the screening space, routine screening, PSA, Pap Smear, HPV, some common cancer markers, but we then said that the other $0.5 billion is anatomical pathology. So we have the -- and once we have that specimen, it's only logical for the medical oncologists to start to, once it's declared cancer -- the next question, post surgery is there still cancer cells in this human being, or the next question, if the answer to that is yes, and then there's therapy. The next question is, did the therapy work? Do we still see remnants of DNA from the tumor. So we think this absolutely fits into our overall cancer strategy and Quest Diagnostics today. In particular, again, there is a halo effect. We will own the block, we will own the specimen and doing the testing on that for both treatment monitoring as well as treatment selection, we think, is just a natural. Now, from a commercial standpoint, we have a pretty mature oncology distribution today that calls on pathologists and medical oncologists. And, yes, we are absolutely going to strengthen the team as we finish the commercialization of this assay and to have a more robust channel calling into the medical oncologist space. So good question. Thanks. Yes. Thanks, A.J. So, on your first question, I'll let Sam take the second part. Again, 10% revenue growth on the base business in the quarter, 8% volume growth. I mentioned that health systems was 7%. So our physician book of business actually grew higher than that, if you do that math. And the answer is, we saw strong growth across all of our regions. Did the Northeast grow at a faster rate? Slightly faster rate, yes. So we saw maybe a bit of a rebound there. But look, our comparisons now in the Northeast region are with 2022. There's been population shifts that some of that population is just not going to come back to the Northeast. Now, we see a stronger growth -- continued stronger growth in the Southeast and the Southwest, and that very much could represent some population shift that we're seeing in the country. The last thing I'd mention, although it didn't influence our Q1 numbers, we did mention the startup of our NewYork-Presbyterian outreach deal that's going well. It's going to be a strong contributor to growth in the East region and will be a strong contributor to our overall growth for the rest of the year. So Sam, do you want to take that? Good morning. Yes. So we are really happy with our consumer-initiated testing performance in the quarter. It showed nice growth from progressive growth from Q4. And so, I'm going to talk about the growth. COVID obviously declined in that segment of our business as well. The majority of our CIT business now is our routine base business. We saw a nice progression from Q4 to Q1. We are happy with that. We saw a nice progression Q1 to Q1, really nice progression there. We continue to be excited about a couple of growth categories within CIT. Number one, you probably read allergy season has really taken off and taken off early. So seeing some nice growth there. Just our general health and wellness offering in CIT was really strong in the quarter. And we surveyed some of those general health and wellness customers and found some interesting things. One of the main reasons they're coming to Quest and paying out of pocket is because patients were -- consumers, patients were having a hard time getting in to see their physicians. We're hearing about three-month delays to get to see their doctor. So rather than wait to see their doctor and get their lab testing, they just come in, because they want to know. And then finally, I'd say, our STD category continues to exhibit very strong growth. The CDC just declared again several types of STDs, gonorrhoea, syphilis at epidemic levels. They also indicated that 50% of all new cases that they're seeing across the country are aged 15 to 24. And that's a segment that wants to remain anonymous and just pay out of pocket for lots of reasons. Finally, as we've said about margins, our CIP business is going to be less dilutive this year than it was last year. And I think you can assume that each quarter through the year. All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining today, some really exciting news here, but let me just summarize. Look, we're off to a really strong start here in 2023. Our base business performed stronger than expected, stronger than we expected in the quarter. We feel really, really good about that. and it's certainly offsetting some of the COVID decline that we saw in the quarter. Second, hopefully, you can tell, we're really excited about the Haystack Oncology. We think the technology is the right technology, but more importantly, it's the right team. We are really impressed with the team that will join Quest Diagnostics. And as you know, in these types of acquisitions, it's not just investing in the technology, we're really investing in a group of people and a team, and we feel really, really good about that. We feel great about the MRD space and we believe it's starting to mature from both a physician ordering perspective as well as from a reimbursement perspective. And then, finally, we're well on our way to generating the Invigorate savings that are needed to offset wage inflation, and we feel good about the progress we're making there. So, again, thanks for joining in, and we look forward to seeing you out on the road over the next few months and joining us at our next earnings call in July. So thanks for joining, and have a great day."

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Sir, please go ahead.\nShawn Bevec: Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and will discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u2019 future results include but are not limited to those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS, and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Growth rates associated with our long term outlook projections, including consolidated revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Now here is Jim Davis.\nJim Davis: Thanks Shawn, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the details from the third quarter, I want to recognize the Quest employees who are working hard to serve our patients and customers impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton while also contending with the effects on their personal lives. I\u2019m inspired by their commitment to our values, especially customer focus, collaboration and care during this very difficult time. They bring to life our purpose, working together to create a healthier world one life at a time. Now turning to our results. We delivered a strong third quarter with total revenue growth of 8.5%, including 4.2% organic growth, driven by new customer wins and expanded business with physicians and hospitals, as well as acquisitions. During the third quarter, we completed three acquisitions. We finalized our acquisition of LifeLabs, a trusted lab leader serving millions of Canadians. LifeLabs provides a strong foundation for us to expand in Canada, and we are excited about the growth opportunities serving a population that is growing and with more favorable demographics than in the U.S. We also completed our transaction with Allina Health, a leading non-profit health system serving Minnesota and western Wisconsin; and at the end of the quarter, we acquired the laboratory business of three physician groups in New York. During the quarter, we also announced the plans to acquire select outreach lab assets from Ohio Health and University Hospitals, two leading non-profit health systems in Ohio. We completed the transaction with Ohio Health just last week and expect to complete the acquisition with University Hospitals later this quarter. Our recent outreach acquisitions highlight our ability to attract top health systems seeking to evolve their lab strategies to improve access and affordability. They also position us to expand in geographic areas of the U.S. where the influence of health systems had previously limited our reach. We are now on track to complete eight acquisitions this year that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns. Now I\u2019ll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the third quarter, and then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers: physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster growing clinical areas, including brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver with an emphasis on accretive outreach purchases, as well as other independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are some updates on the progress we have made in each of these areas. In physician lab services, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by new customer wins and expanded business, largely due to increased utilization of our advanced diagnostics. Our acquisitions also contributed to growth within this core customer channel, and as a reminder, volumes from both hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions originate in physician offices. We also continued to see strong volume and revenue growth within Medicare Advantage plans, where narrow network strategies direct testing to high quality, cost efficient options like Quest. During the quarter, we also made progress to expand into new geographies through our health plan partnerships. We renewed a large national health plan agreement with Elevance Health that will extend our reach in Virginia, Georgia, Colorado and Nevada, markets in which we had previously limited access. We also broadened our access in Virginia and Florida with our recently announced arrangements with Sentara Health Plans. In hospital lab services, we grew revenues mid single digits, which is above historical levels. Hospitals continues to struggle to fill specialized lab positions, including histology, cytotechnology, and microbiology. In addition, the range and scope of testing being ordered is increasing as hospitals take advantage of our expanding advanced diagnostics portfolio rather than building their own in-house capability. These dynamics contributed to strong continued demand for reference testing. Our expertise managing laboratories can help hospitals improve quality and efficiency in their core lab operations. During the quarter, we formed a professional lab services collaboration with a leading health system in New Jersey that includes reference testing as well as laboratory and supply chain management. Quest specializes in scaling diagnostic innovations to improve access, quality and affordability. This ability enables us to help hospitals address the many challenges that they face, from workforce shortages to capital constraints to the demand for more affordable care from patients, health plans and employers. That\u2019s why premier health systems continue to seek us out for a range of collaborations, ranging from reference testing to professional lab management to outreach acquisitions. In consumer initiated testing, our consumer-facing platform, QuestHealth.com grew total revenues more than 40%. Our repeat customer rate has grown to 30% from less than 10% two years ago, driven by demand for comprehensive health, chronic disease, and STI testing. During the quarter, we also introduced micronutrient blood tests to help identify vitamin and mineral deficiencies. In addition, we continued to expand our partner network with resellers and ecommerce providers. In advanced diagnostics, we drove double-digit revenue growth across several clinical areas. The growth was particularly strong in areas of brain health, especially for our AD-Detect blood-based Alzheimer\u2019s disease testing as well as in women\u2019s health, cardio-metabolic health, and autoimmune disorders. Our investments in advanced diagnostics enable us to deliver and scale innovative services that improve patient care and drive growth. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are pleased with the results to date from our Haystack MRD early experience program through which providers from many leading academic and community oncology centers have used our Haystack MRD blood test to assess cancer recurrence and treatment response for solid tumor cancers. We are on track to make Haystack MRD available nationally to providers in the fourth quarter. Our growth in women\u2019s health was largely driven by prenatal and hereditary genetic testing, consistent with recent quarters. We also saw continued robust testing demand in genital tract infections, which includes several STIs. This month, we introduced a specimen self-collection option at our 2000 patient service centers that give women a fast, convenient and discrete way to access GTI testing. In the area of autoimmune disorders, we saw strong demand for our testing solutions which help primary care physicians comprehensively screen for autoimmune disorders in order speed diagnosis and care by specialists. Finally, we were pleased to have been selected by the CDC to be one of a handful of diagnostic service providers to support the development of laboratory tests for H5N1 avian flu and oropouche viruses. We plan to introduce an H5N1 avian flu test later this month. Now turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements driven largely through the use of automation and AI to improve productivity, as well as service levels and quality. During the quarter, we completed the build-out of full end-to-end automation for our core routine tests at our Lenexa, Kansas laboratory, making it the third fully automated lab in our national network. We are now piloting automated specimen accessioning in our Clifton lab, which will help increase productivity in specimen processing and improve quality. Finally, we are pleased to extend our collaboration with Hologic to include their automated cytology solution, the Hologic Genius digital diagnostic system which utilizes AI to help analyze cervical cell samples. We expect this solution will help us improve quality and efficiency in cervical cancer screening. Now before I turn it over to Sam, I want to take a moment to recognize the decision by Congress to delay Medicare reimbursement cuts and data collection scheduled under PAMA for 2024. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to collaborate with our trade association, ACLA, to encourage Congress to secure a permanent legislative solution that provides fair reimbursement. Now Sam will give more details on our third quarter performance and our updated guidance for 2024. Sam?\nSam Samad: Thanks Jim. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.49 billion, up 8.5% versus the prior year. Consolidated organic revenues grew by 4.2%. Revenues for diagnostic information services were up 9% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong growth in our key physician and hospital channels as well as the contribution from recently closed acquisitions. As a reminder, our acquisition of LifeLabs closed towards the end of August, and our outreach acquisition from Allina Health closed in September. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 5.5% versus the third quarter of 2023, with acquisitions contributing 5% to total volume. The impact of weather and the Crowdstrike global IT outage in July negatively impacted volume by approximately 40 basis points in the quarter. Total revenue per requisition was up 3.3% versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per req and favorable test mix driven by advanced diagnostics demand, partially offset by the impact of the recent LifeLabs acquisition which carries a lower revenue per requisition than our typical average. Unit price reimbursement was stable, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $330 million or 13.3% of revenues compared to $342 million or 14.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $385 million or 15.5% of revenues compared to $380 million or 16.6% of revenues last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to strong organic revenue growth and the impact of recent acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of weather and the Crowdstrike outage, as well as wage increases and higher performance-based compensation. We estimate the impact of weather and the IT outage on operating margins to be approximately 50 basis points. LifeLabs had a negligible impact on operating margin rates in the quarter. Reported EPS was $1.99 in the quarter compared to $1.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.30 versus $2.22 the prior year. We estimate the EPS impact of weather and the IT outage to be approximately $0.08 in the quarter. Cash from operations was $870 million year-to-date through the third quarter versus $745 million in the prior year. In the third quarter, we issued $1.85 billion of senior notes with an average coupon of approximately 4.8%. Turning now to our updated full year 2024 guidance, revenues are expected to be between $9.8 billion and $9.85 billion. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.55 to $7.65 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.85 to $8.95. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. The following are key assumptions underlying our updated guidance for you to consider. The increase in our updated revenue guidance is related to recently announced and closed acquisitions, with the majority being from LifeLabs. As a reminder, new acquisitions are typically breakeven to slightly profitable initially with profitability expanding over several quarters, therefore we are not expecting a material contribution to earnings from these acquisitions in 2024 but do expect increasing profitability next year. We are projecting the disruption from Hurricane Milton to negatively impact revenues by approximately $15 million and EPS by approximately $0.08 in the fourth quarter. Operating margin is expected to be down versus the prior year due to the integration of LifeLabs and the combined impact of weather and Crowdstrike headwinds. Excluding the impact of these items, full year operating margin is expected to be up. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $200 million, weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. We have narrowed our adjusted EPS guidance and maintain the midpoint of $8.90 despite the impact of Hurricane Milton in the fourth quarter. While we aren\u2019t prepared to provide 2025 guidance today, I\u2019d like to share some initial considerations as you think about next year. We are reaffirming our long term outlook from 2023 through 2026, which assumes a mid single digit revenue CAGR with at least 1% to 2% growth from acquisitions, and a high single digit earnings CAGR with approximately 75 to 150 basis points of margin expansion over the three-year period. Given the eight acquisitions we expect to complete in 2024, we will exceed our 1% to 2% revenue growth targets from acquisitions next year. Excluding LifeLabs, we already expect to be towards the high end of this range due to the carryover contribution from the other acquisitions that will be completed this year. Interest expense is expected to increase next year as a result of our recent debt issuance. As I noted previously, we raised $1.85 billion of senior notes with an average coupon of approximately 4.8% in August, and in March of 2025 we plan to retire $600 million of senior notes with a coupon of 3.5%. Finally, as we consider all the moving pieces heading into 2025, we expect to deliver earnings growth consistent with our long term outlook in the high single digits. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.\nJim Davis: Thanks Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong total and organic revenue growth driven by new customers wins and expanded business with physicians and hospitals, as well as acquisitions. We are now on track to complete eight acquisitions by year\u2019s end that meet our criteria for profitability, growth and returns. Our growing advanced diagnostics offering and increasing health plan access positions us to drive new customer business next year. Given the strength of our business and revenue from acquisitions, we are well positioned to drive accelerated revenue growth and earnings growth in 2025. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes: Good morning. Thank you. Thanks for all the details on 2025. When you think about next year, how do you think the organic growth profile of the business will do? And within that, can you remind us with Haystack, is there any change in your assumptions now that you\u2019ve had the asset for over a year on how you think it will do in 2025? Thanks.\nJim Davis: Yes. So good morning, Ann. We just came off a very strong quarter of organic growth of 4.2%, driven by good volume growth and really nice improvements in rev per req, those improvements in rev per req coming with basically price being about flat, price per test, but really nice increases in tests per req and test mix. So as we enter into 2025, we would put out there at this point approximately 3%, I mean, it\u2019s hard to judge what\u2019s going to go on with utilization, but by all means and based on some of the payor report outs earlier in the week and last week, it appears that utilization remains strong. So I think an assumption of roughly 3% is solid. In terms of Haystack, we\u2019ve said the dilution this year is approximately $0.20. We said the dilution going into next year would be less, and we\u2019re still on track to achieve that.\nSam Samad: Yes, with regards to Haystack, Ann, the incremental dilution this year is $0.20, so it\u2019s a total of $0.35 to $0.40 dilution, and it will improve next year. And we are preparing to launch the assay in the next few months here and expect to get reimbursement as we go forward as well.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nMichael Cherny: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe if I can go back to just some of your commentary about the marketplace and your positioning, if I heard correctly, I think you had some incremental share gains from Elevance, obviously, you have a combination of inorganic growth. As you think about building on Ann\u2019s question a bit relative to the organic side, how much do you feel like the growth profile is within your control relative to that share pick-up, relative to what you\u2019re doing on the pricing side versus market driven? If there\u2019s any we can break that down, that\u2019d be great.\nJim Davis: Yes. So first, thanks for the question, Mike. With respect to Elevance, none of those changes take effect until the first of the year in 2025, and those changes, which are allowing us to be in network in the states of Colorado and in the states of Nevada, with expanded access in Georgia and Virginia. But again none of those changes have any impact on our third quarter results, but we expect those to help fuel organic growth going into next year.\nSam Samad: Maybe if I add also, with regards to pricing and share gains, I think in terms of pricing, we still expect flattish to slightly improving reimbursement dynamics within our business - I think that\u2019s the expectation going forward, as it is this year, so we\u2019re seeing a positive improvement in reimbursement dynamics. And in addition to the increased access that Jim just talked about, we are also seeing share gains as a result of the hospital outreach acquisitions that we\u2019ve made, where we\u2019ve gained some -- we\u2019ve shifted share and we\u2019ve gained some good market share recently as a result of these acquisitions.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys, thank you for taking the questions. Sam, maybe one on LifeLabs, nice to see that close early. Can you just talk a little about both the margin impact that you see near term there, I know obviously accretive to earnings, but just the margin impact; and then the progression on the earnings accretion as we get into next year? I know there\u2019s some accounting stuff that maybe holds it back a little bit and then it should step up, but it would be helpful just to talk through that profile. And then lastly just Jim, on the M&A side, since we\u2019re on the topic. What the pipeline looks like? Should we expect continued smaller deals versus something like LifeLabs, being a much larger one, and what you\u2019re seeing there? Thank you, again.\nSam Samad: Yes, you\u2019re welcome, and good morning, Patrick. So with regards to -- I\u2019ll talk maybe briefly about operating margins first, and then I\u2019ll talk about how LifeLabs impacted it in Q3 and what the trajectory is going forward, just at a high level. We won\u2019t go into too much details in terms of the actual specifics around the deal. But in Q3, operating margins were 15.5%. I would say adjusted for weather, that was closer to 16%. We had both weather and CrowdStrike impacted us by about 50 basis points. There was a slight negative impact from LifeLabs as well in the quarter. As you know, we had about five weeks\u2019 worth of LifeLabs revenues in there. The deal is scaling up in terms of profitability. There are some adjustments at the beginning as well in terms of some accounting adjustments, as you mentioned. But really, the margin profile of the deal is expected to increase as we go forward. Now, we talked about potential $0.10 to $0.15 EPS accretion from the deal in year one, and that was assuming that the deal would close basically at the end of the year, so we\u2019d have a full year in 2025. So, the deal closed a bit earlier, so we still -- we\u2019ll give more color on the Q4 call in terms of what the expectation is for 2025 specifically. But listen, at a high level, Patrick, I would just say that the operating margin to start will be below our overall operating margin as an enterprise. So it\u2019s going to be a bit dilutive in terms of operating margin rates but accretive in terms of operating margin dollars and EPS. And it\u2019s going to ramp up over the next two to three years to eventually be at the level of Quest operating margins, but that\u2019s going to take some time. So, I\u2019d say focus more on operating margin dollars and EPS accretion that we get from the deal, as opposed to the operating margin rates in the short term.\nJim Davis: Yes. Patrick, in terms of your question on -- the last part of your question on the funnel and the M&A pipeline. So it does remain strong, and lots of discussions going on with various health systems around the country. But what I would say now is we\u2019re in this phase of integration and digestion of the deals that we\u2019ve just completed, including the lab assets of PathAI, Allina Health System, Ohio Health, University Hospitals, the three physician office labs here in New York, and then obviously LifeLabs. So we are hard at work at integrating these and getting the margin accretion that we\u2019ve talked about. Our appetite will continue for small outreach deals, and we\u2019re always on the look for those.\nOperator: The next question will come from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPito Chickering: Hey, good morning guys. Can I go back to the questions on Elevance and Sentara Health, on those contracts you talked about earlier? I guess, why weren\u2019t you in those contracts previously? Did you have to give any pricing concessions in any states in order to go in those markets, or did you give pricing concessions to enter the states? Who was previously servicing those patients? It\u2019s just been a long time since we\u2019ve seen such large managed care contract wins for you guys, so just curious were other central labs servicing these guys or is it simply payors pushing large labs, who take share from hospital-based labs? Thanks so much.\nJim Davis: Yes, so with respect to Elevance, we\u2019ve been in their network broadly on a national basis, except for the markets that I indicated - Colorado and Nevada, we were completely out of their network. Georgia, we had limited access to some products but not all, and the same with Virginia. This is just an opening up, like many of the other large national labs, that provide access to all the independent labs, so we feel great on that. Sentara, we were previously not serving - it was being served by other laboratories, and they made the decision to put us in their network. It\u2019s a great health plan, a great health system that was in Virginia, but the health plan actually goes down well below Virginia into the Carolinas and Florida, so we feel really, really good about that. Look, I think it represents just a commitment on behalf of these health plans to include independent labs that offer great quality. It starts with great quality, great service, and really competitive pricing.\nShawn Bevec: Next question, Operator?\nOperator: The next question will come from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMeghan Holtz: Good morning guys, and congrats on the quarter. This is Meghan Holtz on for Brian. Just going back to guidance, at [indiscernible] core EPS guidance is up slightly, right? If I just check my math, the midpoint stays at $8.90 but you have to add back the $0.08 from Milton, while LifeLabs should be a little less, so can you just kind of break down that EPS guidance?\nSam Samad: Yes, sure. To talk about EPS guidance, let me talk a little bit about revenue as well, because--you know, we took up revenue, as you know, by $285 million at the midpoint. The majority of that was really M&A, and the majority of the M&A was really LifeLabs, so in terms of the $285 million at the midpoint, I would say the majority really is driven by M&A, which as we said scales up with profitability, so little to no profitability in the initial term. To your point around EPS, we tightened the range by a nickel on each side. The midpoint remains unchanged at $8.90. We are absorbing an $0.08 headwind from Milton in Q4, so yes, you are correct in the sense that EPS excluding the impact of Milton would have gone up, and that\u2019s driven by the strength of the organic business. We\u2019re seeing some, as you saw in Q3, great rev per req at 3.3%, organic rev per req was even higher than that. We\u2019re seeing good utilization, so some of that strength is offsetting the impact of Milton, but largely kept the EPS unchanged at the midpoint.\nMeghan Holtz: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Westenberg of Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg : Hi, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a good quarter. I believe [audio loss] reduced pretty meaningfully. I think you\u2019re still seeing wage inflation here above historical norms, so can you just talk about some of the pushes and pulls in terms of historically low unemployment rate? Are there actually maybe some tailwinds you\u2019re seeing with insurance and other things, maybe even price increases that could help offset that, and can you talk about maybe some of the headwinds in terms of wage pressures, how long they\u2019re expected to continue, and if we did continue to see some of those wage pressures, are there any other ways you can get operating leverage, say AI, automation, etc.? Thank you.\nSam Samad: Dave, just real quick, you broke up there in the very beginning. What did you start with?\nDavid Westenberg: I started there with turnover rates being reduced; however, I still believe wage inflation is above historical norms, so can you just talk about the pushes and pulls with that, and then I think you got the rest of the question all right.\nSam Samad: Yes, we got it, thanks.\nJim Davis: Yes, so as we indicated in the script, our turnover rates have come down here in 2024, so last year they were in the low 20s, and we\u2019re now below 20%, in the 18% to 19% range. Some of this still depends on job category, but overall we\u2019ve seen really nice improvement. Now, the wage inflation of 3% to 4%, I\u2019d say it\u2019s slightly less than last year, but in terms of historical norms, if you want to go back to 2012 to 2019, kind of pre-COVID, I would tell you it was in the 2% to 3% range, so it\u2019s 100 basis points higher than it historically was. As we walk into next year, it might be a bit early to tell, but I would still think it\u2019s going to hang closer to 3%, in that range. I think you\u2019re reading the same articles we are - the quit rate in American has certainly come down. I think unemployment is relatively stable, so I think there will be continued tightness in the labor markets, particularly on our frontline employees, and by those employees, we mean our phlebotomists, our logistics, our specimen processors. It\u2019s actually those positions where we see a more competitive labor environment primarily because those three types of roles, they can move from industry to industry. They don\u2019t need to stay in the lab industry. Now, there\u2019s lots of things we\u2019re doing to continue to offset that wage inflation. We\u2019ve talked a lot about the use of automation and AI in our laboratories. As we indicated in the script, we just went live with our third highly automated laboratory, full automation in our Lenexa, Kansas operation. We\u2019ve installed what we called some front end specimen automation sorting types of equipment in several of our laboratories, and we\u2019re getting nice use out of that; and then we continue to expand some of our automated and AI-driven platforms, like the COPAN--the COPAN microbiology platform, which continues to give us a ton of productivity across our laboratories.\nSam Samad: Yes, and if I just add a couple of things, David, with regards to just overall productivity and leverage in the P&L as both we look in 2024 and going forward, but we are seeing a couple of positive dynamics there as well that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of. In terms of rev per req, pricing is a modest favorable. I don\u2019t mean to say that it still isn\u2019t a challenging pricing environment in the health system space, but overall we\u2019re getting flat to positive reimbursement. We\u2019re seeing tests per req continue to go up versus historically, we\u2019re seeing a nice step up in terms of tests per req as well as test mix, which are both giving us a positive in terms of overall rev per req. Utilization, we\u2019ve talked about continues to be positive, and also aided by the fact that we\u2019ve gained share with some of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done, so overall all of these would drive us to additional productivity and improved leverage as we look forward, and this year in 2024.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, good morning. I wanted to follow up--for Sam, I have a couple of follow-ups, just trying to dig into the quarterly revenue a little bit. The first was could you just tell me what the COVID sales were? I\u2019m trying to gauge what the base was doing within the 4% organic growth. Then second is it looks like M&A added about $100 million of sales in the quarter. How much was the initial five weeks from LifeLabs versus everything else? Could it have been, like, 50/50?\nSam Samad: Sure Jack, yes. With regards to COVID, as you have noted, we\u2019ve stopped really reporting COVID and we\u2019ve stopped reporting base versus total, because it\u2019s really become somewhat insignificant. All I would say is it was largely within our expectations in Q3. It\u2019s impacted from a year-to-year--on a year-to-year basis, it impacted growth by about 50 basis points. That was the impact of COVID in terms of total impact on revenue growth. Now with regards to M&A, I think your other question, so we grew by 8.5% in total revenues for the quarter, organic growth was about 4.2%, so we had about a 4% contribution from M&A. LifeLabs over five weeks or so was about $70 million roughly in terms of revenues in the quarter, so that should give you a sense as to the contribution of LifeLabs. Obviously it\u2019s a significant portion of the M&A growth.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi guys. Thanks so much for the question. [Audio loss] so long term question. One, can you just confirm the DCP impact in the quarter? I know that created some unnecessary volatility, just--you know, it was always neutral to EPS. Then longer term, I think what you guys were saying was it sounds like you\u2019re saying in general that unit pricing, we should think of sort of as stable to slightly positive for 2025 as well - I think that\u2019s what you are saying. Just if you could confirm that, that\u2019d be great. Thank you.\nSam Samad: Yes, with regards to DCP, Elizabeth - first, thanks for the question. On a year-to-year basis, it was up, I would say close to $10 million in the quarter itself, so it was a negative impact on operating margin in the quarter. That should give you the detail that you want. It\u2019s going to ebb and flow depending on the markets, but this quarter it was a negative impact year-over-year. Then with regards to pricing, I think the current view and what we\u2019ve been seeing in 2024 is that--you know, if I kind of bifurcate that, health systems is definitely a net negative in terms of a challenging health systems environment, in terms of the reimbursement and pricing dynamics. Health plans, I would say modestly positive, flat to modestly positive. Overall when you put the pieces together, and we\u2019ve got the government business right now, we expect to be flat pricing as well since the PAMA cuts were deferred, so overall I\u2019d say the expectation is flat to slightly positive, is the current view. We\u2019ll give you more information when we give specific 2025 guidance on the Q4 call.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Yes, the next question is from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks. With the hospital outreach deals and the market share gains, you\u2019ve been talking about that a little bit more recently, and are there specific geographies where you\u2019re seeing that sort of halo effect around these deals? Has anything changed in terms of your strategy around what you target or how you\u2019re approaching these hospital outreach deals? I guess any way to quantify it as well how much in terms of market share gains is this contributing at the moment, just from either a volume or revenue perspective? Thanks.\nJim Davis: Yes, so the three deals we announced, Allina in the Minneapolis market and closed Ohio Health in Columbus, Ohio, and University Hospitals which we expect to close later in the quarter in Cleveland, Ohio, all three of those markets had the characteristics of the majority of independent physicians were owned by health systems and therefore using the labs of those health systems. It puts us into those three marketplaces. Our share in those markets was de minimis before these acquisitions, and so now we have a strong presence in those three markets, all of which are big markets, growing markets. We will continue to look for other markets in the U.S. where we have strong payor access. By the way, in all of those markets, we were in network with obviously all the nationals and all the Blues plans that play in those markets, so we had strong access but our ability to sell, given that the physicians were largely owned by the health systems, was very limited. Those are the characteristics of the markets that we look for in terms of these outreach acquisitions. We look for markets where we have strong access, which we do nationally, and we look for markets where health systems have dominated in that space and they may be willing to get out of that market.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.\nStephanie Davis: Hey guys, thank you so much for taking my question. You had in the prepared remarks comments about volume and revenue benefits from narrower networks at the MA plans, so I was curious, given some of the challenges those clients are facing, could you see potential for an accelerated pace of adoption of this strategy and some forward benefits in the coming few years?\nJim Davis: I think all of the Medicare Advantage plans versus Medicare are going to have, by definition, more narrow networks. Medicare, as you know, is any willing provider, and if you look at the Medicare work spread across the country, that health systems generally do fairly well in that space. Again, by definition when a life moves from a Medicare plan to a Medicare Advantage plan, most of the Medicare Advantage plans have networks that are more defined and more narrow, so there is generally good things that come from that. Now going forward, the Medicare Advantage plans, yes, they seem to be under some--they\u2019re experiencing higher utilization - that\u2019s generally good for us, but they\u2019re experiencing profit pressures on that book of business as well, so to the extent more of that work comes to independent labs like Quest Diagnostics, it means good quality, great service, and generally lower costs, so we welcome the opportunity to work with all the Medicare Advantage plans to continue to move work from high priced out-of-network labs to labs like Quest Diagnostics.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much, good morning. I just had a couple of follow-up questions on LifeLabs. Jim, I think in your prepared remarks, you made a comment that the demographics are more favorable in Canada. Can you maybe just help us understand what market growth looks like in Canada, and then secondly, you talked about the margins being below the corporate average at Quest today and that over two to three years, you\u2019ll get there? Can you give us an idea of what the margins look like today for LifeLabs?\nJim Davis: Yes, so first on the demographics of Canada, the population growth of Canada is actually significantly higher than the U.S., so it\u2019s been north of 1% for the last several years, so that\u2019s good news for us and for all those that participate. Second is the aging of the Canadian population is also--the average age of the population there is north of what it is in the U.S., and the demographics of older people--you know, what we see in the U.S., obviously Medicare and Medicare Advantage, there is more reqs per life, they visit physicians more frequently, generally higher acuity levels, and so serving an older population is also beneficial to the industry, to us. That\u2019s why we like the demographics of Canada. There\u2019s some variation between that in Ontario, in British Columbia, the two major provinces that we serve, but in total we think it\u2019s a great place to operate. Now in terms of the margin, yes, the operating margin rate is lower than our company average, and we expect over the next couple years, through the synergies that we expect to get and through sharing of ideas, best practices from us to them and them to us, we expect to get the margin rate back to close to Quest company average.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Brackmann: Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, I wanted to go back to your comment on integration and digestion. Can you maybe just sort of talk about how your integration efforts or tactics have evolved over the last few years, the things that you can share which maybe give a little bit more comfort on keeping up this accelerated pace of deals going forward? Thank you.\nJim Davis: Yes, so it very much depends on the deal. I mean, let\u2019s start with LifeLabs - LifeLabs, it operates in Canada, obviously we\u2019re here in the U.S., so there is not what I would call big synergies across--we\u2019re not shutting down any laboratories, we\u2019re not changing the phlebotomy network or the logistics network at all. What we do look for in opportunities like that is--you know, we look for procurement synergies, right - what are we buying things at, what are they buying things at, and then we\u2019re going to take the best of the best price, and in general that is on the Quest Diagnostics side. Second is we benchmark their operations versus our operations - you know, in phlebotomy, the draws per FTE, logistics, how many stops per person. In the laboratory, we benchmark not just the overall laboratory but the departments within the laboratory - microbiology, auto chemistry. Really what it is, it\u2019s a series of best practices shared from each side, and in some cases we obviously learn things from them that we bring back into our operations. That\u2019s the nature of LifeLabs. Now, with the health system deals, in general what we\u2019re acquiring is a book of business. We\u2019re not acquiring laboratories, we\u2019re not acquiring logistics. In many cases, we take on the phlebotomists that were serving that network. Really, the integration is about, number one, IT integration, integrating with all of their physicians, whether they\u2019re on Epic or Cerner of whatever EMR they\u2019re on; and then second, it\u2019s about the movement of that work from the hospital lab into Quest Diagnostics, so we look for opportunities in logistics and, again, phlebotomy to get synergies and productivity out of that. Generally, what we bring to these integrations are dedicated full time groups of people. They hit within the regional structure of Quest, so depending on the region, we come in with a dedicated team that works the IT side, the phlebotomy side, the logistics side and the laboratory side, and as Sam said in his remarks, it will take several quarters to get these books of business up to the profitability rate that we expect. It\u2019s a lot of hard work and the team has some deep experience in doing this.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: The next question is from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks. Thanks for getting my question in - I appreciate it. I just want to go through some of these moving pieces. I appreciated the color that you gave on 2025, but if we just kind of think--tell me I\u2019m not thinking about this incorrectly, revenue growth should probably be better, given all the M&A that\u2019s maturing into next year. You talked about the organic growth is still estimated to be up 3% roughly. The cost trends, wages and the like, 3% to 4%--3%, hopefully Invigorate is there to offset that, plus you add in the benefit of the maturation of LifeLabs, which $0.10 to $0.15, is probably going to be more than that as you\u2019re getting an extra quarter than you anticipated, and you have Haystack dilution coming down. Isn\u2019t it-- I mean, unless I\u2019m not thinking about the impact, or there is a negative impact to core margins, shouldn\u2019t EPS grow faster next year than your traditional CAGR, just thinking about all those moving pieces?\nSam Samad: Yes, so I think you\u2019ve got the moving pieces right, Kevin. As you said, we\u2019ve got--and as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got M&A excluding LifeLabs growing at the high end of the range that we\u2019ve given, about 2%. We\u2019ve got LifeLabs adding a full year worth of revenues in there, so that will help revenues as well, so yes, revenue growth will be faster. We\u2019ve got also the carryover from some of the M&A that we\u2019ve done this year. I mean, in terms of the cost headwinds right now, it\u2019s, I\u2019d say early to say that we\u2019re going to face lesser headwinds in general, like in terms of inflation for instance. We\u2019re still assuming in general that 3% to 4%. I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re assuming that that\u2019s going to moderate significantly next year, so what we\u2019re seeing today is in that 3% to 4% range, and I think we\u2019re expecting that to be the same. I think the pricing dynamics, we\u2019ll give more detail on that on the Q4 call, but in general fairly in line with what we\u2019re seeing right now, which is flat to slightly positive, although as I said before, we are seeing competitive dynamics in the health system space. For now, we\u2019re seeing EPS is growing in the high single digits, so to the extent that we provide more information on the Q4 call that\u2019s different than that, we will; but at this point with the visibility that we have with all the moving pieces, we feel comfortable just reaffirming that growth rate for EPS. There isn\u2019t anything here that\u2019s a negative that we\u2019re--you know, that you\u2019re teasing out, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re not disclosing. It\u2019s basically we feel comfortable that with all the moving parts, that we\u2019re at the high end of the guidance range that we gave before.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Our last question will come from Michael Riskin of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nMichael Riskin: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I\u2019ll close with one, a lot of this has been covered. I wanted to ask a little bit on PAMA - obviously it\u2019s been delayed. You made some comments about potentially working on a permanent legislative solution. Could you expand on that a little bit, like what that could look like, and obviously PAMA has been delayed for a number of years now, so we\u2019re kind of used to this, but any sense of what the future could look like there, just so we\u2019re not in a constant delay cycle again? Thanks.\nJim Davis: Yes, so you\u2019re right - PAMA has now been delayed five straight years, and it is certainly a welcome relief to us and to our entire industry. Now having said that, look - SALSA has continued to be on the legislative agenda. It\u2019s a complex task to get these things approved - there is one Senate committee, two House committees that you have to work through, and as you know with the election coming up, a lot of these committees could potentially change - the leadership can change, members can change, and so our trade association and the members of it will be hard at work once the election is over and once the committee memberships are defined, we\u2019ll be hard at work to figure out who on these committees are going to support us and to put forth a fix to this constant year-over-year, I would say battle that we have to defer these cuts. We were happy with the SALSA solution, which called for--if enacted, called for another year of a delay followed by a new data collection process. There were agreed to reductions, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the solution we\u2019re going to put forth on the table. You know, we\u2019ve had five straight years of delayed cuts, and while that sounds good, in fact it\u2019s not good because we\u2019ve had five really heavy years of wage inflation and other inflation, and we\u2019re going to press the case that in fact the Medicare rates should go up. We\u2019ve gotten rates up through our commercial plans. Yes, as Sam said, there\u2019s been pressure on our hospital reference pricing, but we believe, given the inflationary environment that we\u2019ve lived in from 2019 to 2024, that the rates need to go up, and so that\u2019s the fix that we\u2019re going to propose. We believe a new data collection process will indicate that when they benchmark our pricing across all the commercial plans, including what the commercial plans are paying hospital labs. I think we\u2019ll find that the combination of those prices would lead one to believe that Medicare pricing should go up, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to push for going forward.\nJim Davis: Okay, so thank you very much for joining the call today. We appreciate your support. Have a good day, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics third quarter 2024 conference call.

            "content": "Thanks Jim. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.49 billion, up 8.5% versus the prior year. Consolidated organic revenues grew by 4.2%. Revenues for diagnostic information services were up 9% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong growth in our key physician and hospital channels as well as the contribution from recently closed acquisitions. As a reminder, our acquisition of LifeLabs closed towards the end of August, and our outreach acquisition from Allina Health closed in September. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions increased 5.5% versus the third quarter of 2023, with acquisitions contributing 5% to total volume. The impact of weather and the Crowdstrike global IT outage in July negatively impacted volume by approximately 40 basis points in the quarter. Total revenue per requisition was up 3.3% versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per req and favorable test mix driven by advanced diagnostics demand, partially offset by the impact of the recent LifeLabs acquisition which carries a lower revenue per requisition than our typical average. Unit price reimbursement was stable, consistent with our expectations. Reported operating income in the third quarter was $330 million or 13.3% of revenues compared to $342 million or 14.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $385 million or 15.5% of revenues compared to $380 million or 16.6% of revenues last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to strong organic revenue growth and the impact of recent acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of weather and the Crowdstrike outage, as well as wage increases and higher performance-based compensation. We estimate the impact of weather and the IT outage on operating margins to be approximately 50 basis points. LifeLabs had a negligible impact on operating margin rates in the quarter. Reported EPS was $1.99 in the quarter compared to $1.96 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.30 versus $2.22 the prior year. We estimate the EPS impact of weather and the IT outage to be approximately $0.08 in the quarter. Cash from operations was $870 million year-to-date through the third quarter versus $745 million in the prior year. In the third quarter, we issued $1.85 billion of senior notes with an average coupon of approximately 4.8%. Turning now to our updated full year 2024 guidance, revenues are expected to be between $9.8 billion and $9.85 billion. Reported EPS is expected to be in a range of $7.55 to $7.65 and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.85 to $8.95. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. The following are key assumptions underlying our updated guidance for you to consider. The increase in our updated revenue guidance is related to recently announced and closed acquisitions, with the majority being from LifeLabs. As a reminder, new acquisitions are typically breakeven to slightly profitable initially with profitability expanding over several quarters, therefore we are not expecting a material contribution to earnings from these acquisitions in 2024 but do expect increasing profitability next year. We are projecting the disruption from Hurricane Milton to negatively impact revenues by approximately $15 million and EPS by approximately $0.08 in the fourth quarter. Operating margin is expected to be down versus the prior year due to the integration of LifeLabs and the combined impact of weather and Crowdstrike headwinds. Excluding the impact of these items, full year operating margin is expected to be up. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $200 million, weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. We have narrowed our adjusted EPS guidance and maintain the midpoint of $8.90 despite the impact of Hurricane Milton in the fourth quarter. While we aren't prepared to provide 2025 guidance today, I'd like to share some initial considerations as you think about next year. We are reaffirming our long term outlook from 2023 through 2026, which assumes a mid single digit revenue CAGR with at least 1% to 2% growth from acquisitions, and a high single digit earnings CAGR with approximately 75 to 150 basis points of margin expansion over the three-year period. Given the eight acquisitions we expect to complete in 2024, we will exceed our 1% to 2% revenue growth targets from acquisitions next year. Excluding LifeLabs, we already expect to be towards the high end of this range due to the carryover contribution from the other acquisitions that will be completed this year. Interest expense is expected to increase next year as a result of our recent debt issuance. As I noted previously, we raised $1.85 billion of senior notes with an average coupon of approximately 4.8% in August, and in March of 2025 we plan to retire $600 million of senior notes with a coupon of 3.5%. Finally, as we consider all the moving pieces heading into 2025, we expect to deliver earnings growth consistent with our long term outlook in the high single digits. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Yes, with regards to Haystack, Ann, the incremental dilution this year is $0.20, so it's a total of $0.35 to $0.40 dilution, and it will improve next year. And we are preparing to launch the assay in the next few months here and expect to get reimbursement as we go forward as well. Maybe if I add also, with regards to pricing and share gains, I think in terms of pricing, we still expect flattish to slightly improving reimbursement dynamics within our business - I think that's the expectation going forward, as it is this year, so we're seeing a positive improvement in reimbursement dynamics. And in addition to the increased access that Jim just talked about, we are also seeing share gains as a result of the hospital outreach acquisitions that we've made, where we've gained some -- we've shifted share and we've gained some good market share recently as a result of these acquisitions. Yes, you're welcome, and good morning, Patrick. So with regards to -- I'll talk maybe briefly about operating margins first, and then I'll talk about how LifeLabs impacted it in Q3 and what the trajectory is going forward, just at a high level. We won't go into too much details in terms of the actual specifics around the deal. But in Q3, operating margins were 15.5%. I would say adjusted for weather, that was closer to 16%. We had both weather and CrowdStrike impacted us by about 50 basis points. There was a slight negative impact from LifeLabs as well in the quarter. As you know, we had about five weeks' worth of LifeLabs revenues in there. The deal is scaling up in terms of profitability. There are some adjustments at the beginning as well in terms of some accounting adjustments, as you mentioned. But really, the margin profile of the deal is expected to increase as we go forward. Now, we talked about potential $0.10 to $0.15 EPS accretion from the deal in year one, and that was assuming that the deal would close basically at the end of the year, so we'd have a full year in 2025. So, the deal closed a bit earlier, so we still -- we'll give more color on the Q4 call in terms of what the expectation is for 2025 specifically. But listen, at a high level, Patrick, I would just say that the operating margin to start will be below our overall operating margin as an enterprise. So it's going to be a bit dilutive in terms of operating margin rates but accretive in terms of operating margin dollars and EPS. And it's going to ramp up over the next two to three years to eventually be at the level of Quest operating margins, but that's going to take some time. So, I'd say focus more on operating margin dollars and EPS accretion that we get from the deal, as opposed to the operating margin rates in the short term. Yes, sure. To talk about EPS guidance, let me talk a little bit about revenue as well, because--you know, we took up revenue, as you know, by $285 million at the midpoint. The majority of that was really M&A, and the majority of the M&A was really LifeLabs, so in terms of the $285 million at the midpoint, I would say the majority really is driven by M&A, which as we said scales up with profitability, so little to no profitability in the initial term. To your point around EPS, we tightened the range by a nickel on each side. The midpoint remains unchanged at $8.90. We are absorbing an $0.08 headwind from Milton in Q4, so yes, you are correct in the sense that EPS excluding the impact of Milton would have gone up, and that's driven by the strength of the organic business. We're seeing some, as you saw in Q3, great rev per req at 3.3%, organic rev per req was even higher than that. We're seeing good utilization, so some of that strength is offsetting the impact of Milton, but largely kept the EPS unchanged at the midpoint. Dave, just real quick, you broke up there in the very beginning. What did you start with? Yes, we got it, thanks. Yes, and if I just add a couple of things, David, with regards to just overall productivity and leverage in the P&L as both we look in 2024 and going forward, but we are seeing a couple of positive dynamics there as well that I'm sure you're aware of. In terms of rev per req, pricing is a modest favorable. I don't mean to say that it still isn't a challenging pricing environment in the health system space, but overall we're getting flat to positive reimbursement. We're seeing tests per req continue to go up versus historically, we're seeing a nice step up in terms of tests per req as well as test mix, which are both giving us a positive in terms of overall rev per req. Utilization, we've talked about continues to be positive, and also aided by the fact that we've gained share with some of the acquisitions that we've done, so overall all of these would drive us to additional productivity and improved leverage as we look forward, and this year in 2024. Sure Jack, yes. With regards to COVID, as you have noted, we've stopped really reporting COVID and we've stopped reporting base versus total, because it's really become somewhat insignificant. All I would say is it was largely within our expectations in Q3. It's impacted from a year-to-year--on a year-to-year basis, it impacted growth by about 50 basis points. That was the impact of COVID in terms of total impact on revenue growth. Now with regards to M&A, I think your other question, so we grew by 8.5% in total revenues for the quarter, organic growth was about 4.2%, so we had about a 4% contribution from M&A. LifeLabs over five weeks or so was about $70 million roughly in terms of revenues in the quarter, so that should give you a sense as to the contribution of LifeLabs. Obviously it's a significant portion of the M&A growth. Yes, with regards to DCP, Elizabeth - first, thanks for the question. On a year-to-year basis, it was up, I would say close to $10 million in the quarter itself, so it was a negative impact on operating margin in the quarter. That should give you the detail that you want. It's going to ebb and flow depending on the markets, but this quarter it was a negative impact year-over-year. Then with regards to pricing, I think the current view and what we've been seeing in 2024 is that--you know, if I kind of bifurcate that, health systems is definitely a net negative in terms of a challenging health systems environment, in terms of the reimbursement and pricing dynamics. Health plans, I would say modestly positive, flat to modestly positive. Overall when you put the pieces together, and we've got the government business right now, we expect to be flat pricing as well since the PAMA cuts were deferred, so overall I'd say the expectation is flat to slightly positive, is the current view. We'll give you more information when we give specific 2025 guidance on the Q4 call. Yes, so I think you've got the moving pieces right, Kevin. As you said, we've got--and as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we've got M&A excluding LifeLabs growing at the high end of the range that we've given, about 2%. We've got LifeLabs adding a full year worth of revenues in there, so that will help revenues as well, so yes, revenue growth will be faster. We've got also the carryover from some of the M&A that we've done this year. I mean, in terms of the cost headwinds right now, it's, I'd say early to say that we're going to face lesser headwinds in general, like in terms of inflation for instance. We're still assuming in general that 3% to 4%. I wouldn't say that we're assuming that that's going to moderate significantly next year, so what we're seeing today is in that 3% to 4% range, and I think we're expecting that to be the same. I think the pricing dynamics, we'll give more detail on that on the Q4 call, but in general fairly in line with what we're seeing right now, which is flat to slightly positive, although as I said before, we are seeing competitive dynamics in the health system space. For now, we're seeing EPS is growing in the high single digits, so to the extent that we provide more information on the Q4 call that's different than that, we will; but at this point with the visibility that we have with all the moving pieces, we feel comfortable just reaffirming that growth rate for EPS. There isn't anything here that's a negative that we're--you know, that you're teasing out, that's something that we're not disclosing. It's basically we feel comfortable that with all the moving parts, that we're at the high end of the guidance range that we gave before."

            "name": "Jim Davis",
            "content": "Thanks Shawn, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the details from the third quarter, I want to recognize the Quest employees who are working hard to serve our patients and customers impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton while also contending with the effects on their personal lives. I'm inspired by their commitment to our values, especially customer focus, collaboration and care during this very difficult time. They bring to life our purpose, working together to create a healthier world one life at a time. Now turning to our results. We delivered a strong third quarter with total revenue growth of 8.5%, including 4.2% organic growth, driven by new customer wins and expanded business with physicians and hospitals, as well as acquisitions. During the third quarter, we completed three acquisitions. We finalized our acquisition of LifeLabs, a trusted lab leader serving millions of Canadians. LifeLabs provides a strong foundation for us to expand in Canada, and we are excited about the growth opportunities serving a population that is growing and with more favorable demographics than in the U.S. We also completed our transaction with Allina Health, a leading non-profit health system serving Minnesota and western Wisconsin; and at the end of the quarter, we acquired the laboratory business of three physician groups in New York. During the quarter, we also announced the plans to acquire select outreach lab assets from Ohio Health and University Hospitals, two leading non-profit health systems in Ohio. We completed the transaction with Ohio Health just last week and expect to complete the acquisition with University Hospitals later this quarter. Our recent outreach acquisitions highlight our ability to attract top health systems seeking to evolve their lab strategies to improve access and affordability. They also position us to expand in geographic areas of the U.S. where the influence of health systems had previously limited our reach. We are now on track to complete eight acquisitions this year that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns. Now I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the third quarter, and then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers: physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster growing clinical areas, including brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver with an emphasis on accretive outreach purchases, as well as other independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are some updates on the progress we have made in each of these areas. In physician lab services, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was driven by new customer wins and expanded business, largely due to increased utilization of our advanced diagnostics. Our acquisitions also contributed to growth within this core customer channel, and as a reminder, volumes from both hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions originate in physician offices. We also continued to see strong volume and revenue growth within Medicare Advantage plans, where narrow network strategies direct testing to high quality, cost efficient options like Quest. During the quarter, we also made progress to expand into new geographies through our health plan partnerships. We renewed a large national health plan agreement with Elevance Health that will extend our reach in Virginia, Georgia, Colorado and Nevada, markets in which we had previously limited access. We also broadened our access in Virginia and Florida with our recently announced arrangements with Sentara Health Plans. In hospital lab services, we grew revenues mid single digits, which is above historical levels. Hospitals continues to struggle to fill specialized lab positions, including histology, cytotechnology, and microbiology. In addition, the range and scope of testing being ordered is increasing as hospitals take advantage of our expanding advanced diagnostics portfolio rather than building their own in-house capability. These dynamics contributed to strong continued demand for reference testing. Our expertise managing laboratories can help hospitals improve quality and efficiency in their core lab operations. During the quarter, we formed a professional lab services collaboration with a leading health system in New Jersey that includes reference testing as well as laboratory and supply chain management. Quest specializes in scaling diagnostic innovations to improve access, quality and affordability. This ability enables us to help hospitals address the many challenges that they face, from workforce shortages to capital constraints to the demand for more affordable care from patients, health plans and employers. That's why premier health systems continue to seek us out for a range of collaborations, ranging from reference testing to professional lab management to outreach acquisitions. In consumer initiated testing, our consumer-facing platform, QuestHealth.com grew total revenues more than 40%. Our repeat customer rate has grown to 30% from less than 10% two years ago, driven by demand for comprehensive health, chronic disease, and STI testing. During the quarter, we also introduced micronutrient blood tests to help identify vitamin and mineral deficiencies. In addition, we continued to expand our partner network with resellers and ecommerce providers. In advanced diagnostics, we drove double-digit revenue growth across several clinical areas. The growth was particularly strong in areas of brain health, especially for our AD-Detect blood-based Alzheimer's disease testing as well as in women's health, cardio-metabolic health, and autoimmune disorders. Our investments in advanced diagnostics enable us to deliver and scale innovative services that improve patient care and drive growth. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are pleased with the results to date from our Haystack MRD early experience program through which providers from many leading academic and community oncology centers have used our Haystack MRD blood test to assess cancer recurrence and treatment response for solid tumor cancers. We are on track to make Haystack MRD available nationally to providers in the fourth quarter. Our growth in women's health was largely driven by prenatal and hereditary genetic testing, consistent with recent quarters. We also saw continued robust testing demand in genital tract infections, which includes several STIs. This month, we introduced a specimen self-collection option at our 2000 patient service centers that give women a fast, convenient and discrete way to access GTI testing. In the area of autoimmune disorders, we saw strong demand for our testing solutions which help primary care physicians comprehensively screen for autoimmune disorders in order speed diagnosis and care by specialists. Finally, we were pleased to have been selected by the CDC to be one of a handful of diagnostic service providers to support the development of laboratory tests for H5N1 avian flu and oropouche viruses. We plan to introduce an H5N1 avian flu test later this month. Now turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements driven largely through the use of automation and AI to improve productivity, as well as service levels and quality. During the quarter, we completed the build-out of full end-to-end automation for our core routine tests at our Lenexa, Kansas laboratory, making it the third fully automated lab in our national network. We are now piloting automated specimen accessioning in our Clifton lab, which will help increase productivity in specimen processing and improve quality. Finally, we are pleased to extend our collaboration with Hologic to include their automated cytology solution, the Hologic Genius digital diagnostic system which utilizes AI to help analyze cervical cell samples. We expect this solution will help us improve quality and efficiency in cervical cancer screening. Now before I turn it over to Sam, I want to take a moment to recognize the decision by Congress to delay Medicare reimbursement cuts and data collection scheduled under PAMA for 2024. While we are pleased with the delay, we continue to collaborate with our trade association, ACLA, to encourage Congress to secure a permanent legislative solution that provides fair reimbursement. Now Sam will give more details on our third quarter performance and our updated guidance for 2024. Sam? Thanks Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong total and organic revenue growth driven by new customers wins and expanded business with physicians and hospitals, as well as acquisitions. We are now on track to complete eight acquisitions by year's end that meet our criteria for profitability, growth and returns. Our growing advanced diagnostics offering and increasing health plan access positions us to drive new customer business next year. Given the strength of our business and revenue from acquisitions, we are well positioned to drive accelerated revenue growth and earnings growth in 2025. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Yes. So good morning, Ann. We just came off a very strong quarter of organic growth of 4.2%, driven by good volume growth and really nice improvements in rev per req, those improvements in rev per req coming with basically price being about flat, price per test, but really nice increases in tests per req and test mix. So as we enter into 2025, we would put out there at this point approximately 3%, I mean, it's hard to judge what's going to go on with utilization, but by all means and based on some of the payor report outs earlier in the week and last week, it appears that utilization remains strong. So I think an assumption of roughly 3% is solid. In terms of Haystack, we've said the dilution this year is approximately $0.20. We said the dilution going into next year would be less, and we're still on track to achieve that. Yes. So first, thanks for the question, Mike. With respect to Elevance, none of those changes take effect until the first of the year in 2025, and those changes, which are allowing us to be in network in the states of Colorado and in the states of Nevada, with expanded access in Georgia and Virginia. But again none of those changes have any impact on our third quarter results, but we expect those to help fuel organic growth going into next year. Yes. Patrick, in terms of your question on -- the last part of your question on the funnel and the M&A pipeline. So it does remain strong, and lots of discussions going on with various health systems around the country. But what I would say now is we're in this phase of integration and digestion of the deals that we've just completed, including the lab assets of PathAI, Allina Health System, Ohio Health, University Hospitals, the three physician office labs here in New York, and then obviously LifeLabs. So we are hard at work at integrating these and getting the margin accretion that we've talked about. Our appetite will continue for small outreach deals, and we're always on the look for those. Yes, so with respect to Elevance, we've been in their network broadly on a national basis, except for the markets that I indicated - Colorado and Nevada, we were completely out of their network. Georgia, we had limited access to some products but not all, and the same with Virginia. This is just an opening up, like many of the other large national labs, that provide access to all the independent labs, so we feel great on that. Sentara, we were previously not serving - it was being served by other laboratories, and they made the decision to put us in their network. It's a great health plan, a great health system that was in Virginia, but the health plan actually goes down well below Virginia into the Carolinas and Florida, so we feel really, really good about that. Look, I think it represents just a commitment on behalf of these health plans to include independent labs that offer great quality. It starts with great quality, great service, and really competitive pricing. Yes, so as we indicated in the script, our turnover rates have come down here in 2024, so last year they were in the low 20s, and we're now below 20%, in the 18% to 19% range. Some of this still depends on job category, but overall we've seen really nice improvement. Now, the wage inflation of 3% to 4%, I'd say it's slightly less than last year, but in terms of historical norms, if you want to go back to 2012 to 2019, kind of pre-COVID, I would tell you it was in the 2% to 3% range, so it's 100 basis points higher than it historically was. As we walk into next year, it might be a bit early to tell, but I would still think it's going to hang closer to 3%, in that range. I think you're reading the same articles we are - the quit rate in American has certainly come down. I think unemployment is relatively stable, so I think there will be continued tightness in the labor markets, particularly on our frontline employees, and by those employees, we mean our phlebotomists, our logistics, our specimen processors. It's actually those positions where we see a more competitive labor environment primarily because those three types of roles, they can move from industry to industry. They don't need to stay in the lab industry. Now, there's lots of things we're doing to continue to offset that wage inflation. We've talked a lot about the use of automation and AI in our laboratories. As we indicated in the script, we just went live with our third highly automated laboratory, full automation in our Lenexa, Kansas operation. We've installed what we called some front end specimen automation sorting types of equipment in several of our laboratories, and we're getting nice use out of that; and then we continue to expand some of our automated and AI-driven platforms, like the COPAN--the COPAN microbiology platform, which continues to give us a ton of productivity across our laboratories. Yes, so the three deals we announced, Allina in the Minneapolis market and closed Ohio Health in Columbus, Ohio, and University Hospitals which we expect to close later in the quarter in Cleveland, Ohio, all three of those markets had the characteristics of the majority of independent physicians were owned by health systems and therefore using the labs of those health systems. It puts us into those three marketplaces. Our share in those markets was de minimis before these acquisitions, and so now we have a strong presence in those three markets, all of which are big markets, growing markets. We will continue to look for other markets in the U.S. where we have strong payor access. By the way, in all of those markets, we were in network with obviously all the nationals and all the Blues plans that play in those markets, so we had strong access but our ability to sell, given that the physicians were largely owned by the health systems, was very limited. Those are the characteristics of the markets that we look for in terms of these outreach acquisitions. We look for markets where we have strong access, which we do nationally, and we look for markets where health systems have dominated in that space and they may be willing to get out of that market. I think all of the Medicare Advantage plans versus Medicare are going to have, by definition, more narrow networks. Medicare, as you know, is any willing provider, and if you look at the Medicare work spread across the country, that health systems generally do fairly well in that space. Again, by definition when a life moves from a Medicare plan to a Medicare Advantage plan, most of the Medicare Advantage plans have networks that are more defined and more narrow, so there is generally good things that come from that. Now going forward, the Medicare Advantage plans, yes, they seem to be under some--they're experiencing higher utilization - that's generally good for us, but they're experiencing profit pressures on that book of business as well, so to the extent more of that work comes to independent labs like Quest Diagnostics, it means good quality, great service, and generally lower costs, so we welcome the opportunity to work with all the Medicare Advantage plans to continue to move work from high priced out-of-network labs to labs like Quest Diagnostics. Yes, so first on the demographics of Canada, the population growth of Canada is actually significantly higher than the U.S., so it's been north of 1% for the last several years, so that's good news for us and for all those that participate. Second is the aging of the Canadian population is also--the average age of the population there is north of what it is in the U.S., and the demographics of older people--you know, what we see in the U.S., obviously Medicare and Medicare Advantage, there is more reqs per life, they visit physicians more frequently, generally higher acuity levels, and so serving an older population is also beneficial to the industry, to us. That's why we like the demographics of Canada. There's some variation between that in Ontario, in British Columbia, the two major provinces that we serve, but in total we think it's a great place to operate. Now in terms of the margin, yes, the operating margin rate is lower than our company average, and we expect over the next couple years, through the synergies that we expect to get and through sharing of ideas, best practices from us to them and them to us, we expect to get the margin rate back to close to Quest company average. Yes, so it very much depends on the deal. I mean, let's start with LifeLabs - LifeLabs, it operates in Canada, obviously we're here in the U.S., so there is not what I would call big synergies across--we're not shutting down any laboratories, we're not changing the phlebotomy network or the logistics network at all. What we do look for in opportunities like that is--you know, we look for procurement synergies, right - what are we buying things at, what are they buying things at, and then we're going to take the best of the best price, and in general that is on the Quest Diagnostics side. Second is we benchmark their operations versus our operations - you know, in phlebotomy, the draws per FTE, logistics, how many stops per person. In the laboratory, we benchmark not just the overall laboratory but the departments within the laboratory - microbiology, auto chemistry. Really what it is, it's a series of best practices shared from each side, and in some cases we obviously learn things from them that we bring back into our operations. That's the nature of LifeLabs. Now, with the health system deals, in general what we're acquiring is a book of business. We're not acquiring laboratories, we're not acquiring logistics. In many cases, we take on the phlebotomists that were serving that network. Really, the integration is about, number one, IT integration, integrating with all of their physicians, whether they're on Epic or Cerner of whatever EMR they're on; and then second, it's about the movement of that work from the hospital lab into Quest Diagnostics, so we look for opportunities in logistics and, again, phlebotomy to get synergies and productivity out of that. Generally, what we bring to these integrations are dedicated full time groups of people. They hit within the regional structure of Quest, so depending on the region, we come in with a dedicated team that works the IT side, the phlebotomy side, the logistics side and the laboratory side, and as Sam said in his remarks, it will take several quarters to get these books of business up to the profitability rate that we expect. It's a lot of hard work and the team has some deep experience in doing this. Yes, so you're right - PAMA has now been delayed five straight years, and it is certainly a welcome relief to us and to our entire industry. Now having said that, look - SALSA has continued to be on the legislative agenda. It's a complex task to get these things approved - there is one Senate committee, two House committees that you have to work through, and as you know with the election coming up, a lot of these committees could potentially change - the leadership can change, members can change, and so our trade association and the members of it will be hard at work once the election is over and once the committee memberships are defined, we'll be hard at work to figure out who on these committees are going to support us and to put forth a fix to this constant year-over-year, I would say battle that we have to defer these cuts. We were happy with the SALSA solution, which called for--if enacted, called for another year of a delay followed by a new data collection process. There were agreed to reductions, but I'm not sure that's the solution we're going to put forth on the table. You know, we've had five straight years of delayed cuts, and while that sounds good, in fact it's not good because we've had five really heavy years of wage inflation and other inflation, and we're going to press the case that in fact the Medicare rates should go up. We've gotten rates up through our commercial plans. Yes, as Sam said, there's been pressure on our hospital reference pricing, but we believe, given the inflationary environment that we've lived in from 2019 to 2024, that the rates need to go up, and so that's the fix that we're going to propose. We believe a new data collection process will indicate that when they benchmark our pricing across all the commercial plans, including what the commercial plans are paying hospital labs. I think we'll find that the combination of those prices would lead one to believe that Medicare pricing should go up, so that's what we're going to push for going forward. Okay, so thank you very much for joining the call today. We appreciate your support. Have a good day, everyone."

Now I\u2019d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. Please go ahead, sir.\nShawn Bevec : Thank you, and good morning. I'm joined by Jim Davis, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and we'll discuss non-GAAP measures. We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures in the tables to our earnings press release. Actual results may differ materially from those projected. Risks and uncertainties that may affect Quest Diagnostics future results include, but are not limited to, those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing, revenues, or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including consolidated revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth, and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now, here is Jim Davis.\nJim Davis: Thanks Shawn and good morning, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter, with base business revenue growth of nearly 4% and total revenue growth of 2.5% as well as continued improvement in productivity and profitability in the base business. This performance is due to growth of new physician and hospital customers, more favorable test mix that includes greater adoption of advanced diagnostics and continued strength in healthcare utilization. We also made progress improving our operational quality and efficiency through greater use of automation and AI. In addition, we are excited to announce four acquisitions that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns, and that will enable us to expand in strategic growth areas. Our planned acquisition of LifeLabs, a trusted name in laboratory services for millions of Canadians, will enable us to grow in Canada, which has a population that is growing, and aging faster, than in the U.S. LifeLabs is especially strong in two of Canada\u2019s largest and fastest growing provinces, British Columbia and Ontario, which collectively account for about half of the country\u2019s population. We are familiar with the Canadian market, having delivered reference testing to many providers there for over 20 years. LifeLabs has been one of those reference partners for about a decade, so we know firsthand that their business, team and reputation is strong, and provides a solid foundation for growth. We expect to complete the transaction by the end of the year. Our recently announced acquisition of Select Lab Assets of Allina Health, a leading non-profit health system, will enable us to extend our reach in Minneapolis and throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. We also announced our plans to acquire the outreach lab assets of OhioHealth, a nationally recognized charitable health system in Ohio. Both transactions will broaden our presence in geographic areas of the United States where we\u2019ve had limited access to providers due to the predominance of health systems. These acquisitions show our ability to attract and partner with top, growing health systems that share our commitment to expanding patient access to innovative and more affordable testing. We expect to complete both transactions in the third quarter. We also completed our acquisition of PathAI Diagnostics, which provides a readymade platform on which to scale digital pathology and AI to help health systems and other providers improve quality, speed and efficiency in cancer diagnosis. These acquisitions take time and involve teams of dedicated individuals. I want to personally thank my Quest colleagues for delivering on our M&A strategy, and we will now turn our attention to the hard work of integrating these deals. Now, I\u2019ll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the second quarter. Then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics, with an intense focus on faster growing clinical areas, including within brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver, with an emphasis on accretive outreach purchases as well as other independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business, with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are some updates on progress we have made in each of these areas. While we grew total volumes from Diagnostic Information Services 1.1% with base business volume growth of 1.7%, volumes from our base clinical business grew 3.2% in the second quarter, due to the strength among physicians and hospitals. In Physician lab services, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit base business revenue growth. This growth was driven by continued strength in healthcare utilization, as well as overall market growth, and share gains due to new customer wins. We drove favorable test mix as well as growth in test per requisition, which we attribute to greater utilization of our expanding portfolio of advanced diagnostics. Finally, we also saw strong volume and revenue growth within Medicare Advantage plans, where narrow network strategies direct testing to high quality, cost-efficient options like Quest. Our broad health plan access, which extends to approximately 90% of covered lives in the U.S., enabled us to take advantage of high demand for lab services, consistent with recent quarters. Health plans value our ability to improve access, scale innovation and drive costs out of healthcare. We are also working to develop opportunities to serve new geographies with our health plan partners. In Hospital lab services, we grew base business revenues by nearly 4%. Growth of reference testing remains higher than historical levels as hospitals struggled to fill open positions, especially in technical fields, such as histotechnology, microbiology and cytotechnology. Our advanced diagnostics portfolio provides a compelling alternative for hospitals to send us more reference work. Hospitals face several challenges, including high supply costs, high wages and decisions about how and where to deploy their capital. Patients want better value from lab services as well as easier access. Plus, diagnostic innovation is evolving at a fast pace. These dynamics are contributing to an accelerating trend of outreach acquisitions and professional lab service arrangements with the national labs. Our specialization and scale empower us to deliver a breadth of quality, innovative and accessible services that are often far more affordable for the patient. That\u2019s why top hospitals are choosing Quest for reference testing, professional lab services and outreach asset sales that deliver quality and efficiency. In consumer-initiated testing, our consumer facing platform, questhealth.com, grew total revenues nearly 40% while base business revenues grew more than 50% versus the prior year. As we learn more about our customers as our portfolio expands, we are improving growth and marketing productivity. Today, about 25% of our revenues are from existing customers and 20% of our revenues are from tests we introduced in the past year. In Advanced Diagnostics, several key clinical areas drove double-digit revenue growth, continuing the trend in recent quarters. This growth was particularly strong in brain health, women\u2019s health, particularly prenatal and hereditary genetics, and advanced cardiometabolic health. Our Alzheimer\u2019s disease portfolio was the primary driver of growth for our brain health offering. Demand was strong for our AD-Detect blood tests which assess risk based on amyloid, p-tau and APOE biomarkers. Demand was also strong for our CSF test options for aiding treatment decisions. Yesterday, we introduced our Neurofilament Light Chain test, which helps assess neuronal damage that may signify Alzheimer\u2019s disease as well as multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are encouraged by early results of our Haystack MRD Early Experience program prior to the broad national launch later this year. Physicians from leading cancer institutions are using the Haystack MRD blood test to assess cancer recurrence and treatment response for a range of cancers, including colorectal, lung and breast. We also grew the body of evidence on the clinical and economic value of ctDNA blood testing in cancer care. A study published in JAMA Health Forum in June found that MRD testing could reduce costs for health plans, particularly commercial payers, by identifying patients that would benefit from chemotherapy after stage II colon cancer surgery. In addition, research presented at the June ASCO conference showed that Haystack MRD testing identified complete clinical response to immunotherapy for patients with colorectal cancer earlier than standard assessments, such as PET,MRI and endoscopy scans. Finally, we recently expanded our Haystack research collaborations to include Lisata Therapeutics, which will use Haystack MRD to study an investigational treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. Turning to advanced cardiometabolic testing, we are seeing interest in several biomarkers that improve early detection of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases like diabetes and kidney disease. These include insulin resistance, which can identify pre-diabetes risk before AIc tests, and ApoB, a more precise marker of heart attack risk than traditional lipid panels. They also include Lp(a), which is an inherited marker of heart disease risk found in up to 20% of the population and for which several therapies are now in development. Turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver a targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. During the quarter, we expanded our use of automation and AI in order to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. For instance, we advanced our use of automation in front-end specimen processing to now include five of our labs, freeing more of our processors to focus on value-added work. We also expanded our AI capabilities in microbiology to include the ability to segregate out specimens with no evidence of microbial growth so our medical scientists can concentrate on reviewing those with the greatest likelihood of disease. In addition, we broadened our use of AI in customer service to help our representatives access answers more quickly, improving their efficiency and service quality. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam?\nSam Samad : Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.4 billion, up 2.5% versus the prior year while base business revenues grew 3.8%. Organic base business revenues grew by 3.1%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were up 2.8% compared to the prior year reflecting strong growth in our base testing revenues partially offset by lower revenues from COVID-19 testing services. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.1% versus the second quarter of 2023 with acquisitions contributing 40 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 1.7% versus the prior year. Total revenue per requisition was up 1.6% versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per req and favorable test mix, partially offset by the timing of certain value-based arrangements in the second quarter of 2023 that did not repeat this year and lower COVID-19 testing. Base business revenue per req was up 2.4%. Unit price reimbursement was flat. Clinical base business revenues were up 5.1% while volumes grew 3.2%. This primarily reflects growth through our physician and hospital channels, which comprise approximately 90% of our total revenues, and excludes the impact of lower volumes primarily in our employer businesses providing workforce drug testing and employee population health services. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $355 million, or 14.8% of revenues, compared to $348 million, or 14.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $398 million, or 16.6% of revenues, compared to $389 million, or 16.7% of revenues last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to strong growth in the base business, partially offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues and wage increases. Reported EPS was $2.03 in the quarter compared to $2.05 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.35, versus $2.30 the prior year. Cash from operations was $514 million year-to-date through the second quarter versus $538 million in the prior year. Turning now to our updated full year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.5 billion and $9.58 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.57 to $7.77, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.80 to $9.00. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. Given the uncertainty around when the LifeLabs acquisition will close, we are not including this transaction in our updated 2024 guidance. However, in the first 12 months after closing the acquisition, we expect the transaction to generate approximately $710 million in annual revenues and to be slightly dilutive to GAAP EPS, due primarily to amortization of intangibles and other items, but approximately $0.10 to $0.15 accretive to adjusted EPS. These assumptions include the impact of expected debt financing to close the acquisition. With that said, the following are some key assumptions underlying our updated guidance for you to consider. The increase in our revenue guidance reflects the recently announced acquisitions of PathAI Diagnostics, Allina Health, and OhioHealth as well as the strength of our base business. The PathAI Diagnostics acquisition closed in June, while Allina Health and OhioHealth are expected to close in Q3. The revenue contribution from these acquisitions represents the majority of the increase in our updated revenue guidance. As a reminder, new acquisitions are typically breakeven to slightly profitable initially with profitability expanding over several quarters. Therefore, we are not expecting a material contribution to earnings from these acquisitions in 2024, but do expect increasing profitability next year. No change to our expectation for dilution from Haystack Oncology of an incremental $0.20 to adjusted EPS for the full year. Operating margin to expand for the full year, driven by volume growth and improved productivity. Net interest expense expected to be approximately $190 million. This does not include interest expense related to debt financing for the LifeLabs acquisition. Weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. Finally, our operations were affected by the worldwide IT outage last week, which limited our ability to collect and process specimens on Friday and through the weekend. Our labs were processing specimens by Friday afternoon, and the rest of our operations, including patient service centers, were largely restored to normal by yesterday morning. At this point, we estimate the IT outage and a minor impact from hurricane Beryl in Texas earlier this month could amount to a roughly $0.06 to $0.08 headwind on our Q3 earnings. This is currently reflected in our updated full year guidance. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.\nJim Davis : Thanks, Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong total and base revenue growth across our core customer channels, due to strong commercial execution, innovative offerings and ongoing strength in healthcare utilization. We announced four acquisitions that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns and position us for growth in new geographic and service areas. We improved productivity as well as service levels and quality, through greater use of automation and AI. Finally, I\u2019d like to personally thank my nearly 50,000 Quest colleagues for our strong performance this quarter, which is largely the result of the dedication, care and collaboration that they show patients, customers each and every single day. This commitment was exemplified by the tireless efforts of our teams to restore outstanding service for patients and customers this past weekend following the global IT outage. I\u2019m proud to work with so many talented people committed to living our purpose, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open it up to questions. [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes : Hi, good morning. I just had a follow-up question on volume. I believe you said the total base volume is up 1.7%. But if you exclude employer base, it's up 3.2%. Can you just give us more detail on what's happening in that business? Is it just the overall job market? And maybe if you can provide some like profitability versus staff position-based business versus the employer-based business and whether or not it was in line with your estimates? Then my second question just has to do around the Canadian acquisition. Can you just give us more details on that market? How is it different than the U.S.? Why you view it as attractive? Maybe some long-term growth revenue algorithms versus the U.S. business? Is it growing in line with the business? Is it higher growth? That would be great. Thank you.\nJim Davis: Yeah, good morning Ann. Let me start here. So, on the employer side, we have two principal businesses that serve employers. One is our Employee Drug Testing Business, second is our Employer Population Health business. There is a third business as you know called ExamOne that does health risk assessments for life insurance companies. Taken together, all three of those businesses showed meaningful declines in the quarter, and really largely represent the difference in the 3.2% that Sam referred too and the 1.7%. In the drug testing market, there's a couple of shifts going on. Number one, a lot of the job growth is still coming in the services industry, hotel workers, restaurant workers. A lot of those industries just have given up on drug testing. Other companies that still do drug testing, as you probably know, many have eliminated marijuana off the panel, so that has created some pressure. Then the final thing I'd tell you, is there's a shift going on in employee drug testing, where more companies are doing what we call on-site or oral testing, and if that test is positive, it eventually reflexes back to a central lab. But if it's a negative test, it's just an on-site screen and the employee passes and we don't get that work. On the Employee Population Health, we're just seeing companies not spend as much money on these wellness events that they've typically done in the past. Finally again, ExamOne, our life insurance business, that does risk assessments for life insurance. Just the life insurance policies, we saw a spike. During COVID people started to get life insurance again. Post-COVID, that negative trend has continued, which we were seeing actually pre-COVID. Now, let me turn to the Canada market for just a minute here. So look, there's a lot to like about the Canadian market. First of all, a population of roughly 41 million people. The population growth rate is actually faster than the U.S. The population growth there at about 1.1%. Here in the U.S., population growing less than 50 basis points. The aging of the population there as well is a good trend that we like and LifeLabs is really centered in two key markets, British Columbia and Ontario; Ontario being the biggest province in Canada, British Columbia being the second largest province. Collectively, those two provinces are over 50% or close to 50% of the Canadian population. We like the reimbursement model in Canada. It's steady. It's consistent. We think it will fill growth over the coming years. When we look at things like test per req, when we look at the types of testing done here in the U.S. versus Canada, we think there's opportunity to grow the types of testing that we bring into that market from an esoteric standpoint, from an advanced testing standpoint. So we feel great about entering the Canadian market. By the way, it's a market we know. We've served that market for many, many years as a reference provider. We've served LifeLabs, we've served other independent labs and hospital labs up in Canada. So we know the market, we're familiar with it, and we think it's a great opportunity for Quest Diagnostics.\nSam Samad: Maybe a couple of comments to add on the services businesses Ann, just to give you some financials behind them or at least some percentages. I mean, the Workforce Health Solutions businesses, Employer Population Health, and the Employer Solutions are less than 5% of our overall revenues. So just to give you a sense of bucketing of how much those businesses are. So they are not that material or not material to our overall revenues, but as Jim said, they have been impacted post-COVID somewhat significantly and with some of the market dynamics in the drug testing business, so they are impacting our growth rates. And then ExamOne is on top of that, but it's also impacted by some of the dynamics that Jim said coming out of COVID. So these businesses are down significantly year-over-year, but we don't expect further deterioration as we look forward. So there is a year-over-year impact, but we don't expect that to further amplify as we go forward.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Yes, the next question will come from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks for taking my question. It's not usually your want to raise guidance by more than a beat, in any particular quarter. Yet you did, and now we find out there was actually from what appears to be a core, even a greater upside in the second half than what you had originally had, if you back out the impact of the strike and the hurricanes and the like, the IT issues, I mean. So, is that mostly driven just by core? Are you expecting margins to expand a little bit on a year-over-year basis more than what we saw in the second quarter? I guess, I just want to understand what's driving the enthusiasm for the second half improvements. You had the M&A stuff that you mentioned, but you said there wasn't a lot of contributions. So I'm guessing its core, but I'm wondering, is it expected volume? Is it expected mix? Is it expected cost to come in better? You know wage, labor, churn, that kind of thing.\nSam Samad: Yeah, so maybe I'll start Kevin, and Jim can add comments. First, let's kind of talk about the details in terms of what we shared. We said we're going to take up revenues by $100 million. We said we're going to take up EPS \u2013 and this is at the midpoint. We're going to take up EPS by $0.05 to $8.80 to $9. Within the $100 million that we talked about, the majority of that is really new M&A. So essentially M&A that we have signed, that we expect to close sometime between mid Q3 and the end of the year, and those reflect the M&A related to, or the transactions which are Allina Health, OhioHealth. We have some upside from PathAI as well, which we closed in Q2, but wasn't in our original guidance. So the revenue has a majority \u2013 the majority of the revenues is really driven by the M&A that we expect to close. The EPS increase is related to contribution from this M&A, although as we talked about in the prepared remarks, M&A ramps up in terms of profitability, so 2024, in the second half, very little contribution in terms of profitability from M&A. The remainder, I would say is contribution from the base business and some M&A, but little. And we are absorbing as you said, the impact of the IT outage, which is $0.06 to $0.08 in Q3 that we expect to, that we have now sized. This is preliminary. We'll get better detail as we go, but we are absorbing that impact. So, in terms of what's driving this improvement or the raise of EPS, we're basically continuing with a lot of the productivity work and the cost reductions that we have talked about. We have a lot of the AI and productivity improvements that Jim mentioned, a lot of the focus on improving margins. Importantly, base volumes continue to be very strong, and that's the biggest, I would say driver in terms of improved margins in the business. We continue to see base volumes be strong, utilization be strong. So really, that's the key driver. It's strength of volumes. It's continued productivity and cost improvements. It's also the fact that we have, as we've talked about many times over previous calls, a positive pricing and reimbursement environment, which is now stabilized, which is now flat to improving, as opposed to a negative price impact that we used to see in prior years.\nJim Davis: Yeah. Kevin, you probably saw a meaningful improvement in rev per rack in the quarter, and as Sam mentioned, within that rev per rack calculation, price per task, flat to last year. So the improvement is really coming in three areas. One, test per req continued to be very strong, north of four. Pre-COVID, that was a number that was south of four, it was in the threes. So that's a nice uptick, and that's coming from some of our advanced testing around allergy, tick testing, cardiometabolic testing, the neurology testing. And in that also is a mixed improvement that comes from some of those advanced tests. The final thing I'd say is, we saw again, strength in our overall Medicare Advantage and Medicare Book of Business. That pricing as you know, tends to be better than the average, and we also see more advanced tests coming on those requisitions versus our normal general health and wellness requisition. So we expect those trends to continue into the back half of the year, and that's contributing to the improvements that we're laying out there.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink. Your line is open.\nMichael Cherny : Good morning and thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe if I can just dive a little bit into the market. I know there's still some small moving pieces. I appreciate the color you've given so far on some of the employer testing. If I sort through all of the data points you have, the $3.2 billion base business volumes, (A) I just want to make sure I got that number correctly. And then (B) as you think about that number, how do you think about that in terms of translating where you see the health of broad-based market utilization versus where your competitive position is allowing you to take share? I guess just trying to understand fully where you see utilization baked into the implied second half guidance versus what we've seen over the last six to 12 months on a baseline business. Thanks so much.\nJim Davis: Yeah, again, the 3.2% represents the volume growth that we see through what we call our core or base business. And that means our physician business, our hospital reference business, our hospital PLS business, and embedded in that is both clinical, as well as anatomical pathology. So that entire book of business, which is about 90% of the company, the volumes grew 3.2%. Down from Q1, but the compare in Q2 was higher. But again, the 3.2%, we feel really good about that. Now that 3.2% volume growth again translated into 5.1% revenue growth, and that was coming again on the strength of test mix plus the test per req increase that we've been seeing year-over-year. So we feel good about that, again, going into the second half of the year. In terms of the implied growth in the second half of the year, it's in the 3.7% revenue range. So again, and that's just the base or organic, that's without acquisition. The timing of the close of these acquisitions we've set in Q3 with Allina and OhioHealth, we just don't know when in Q3, okay, so there's still some uncertainty about when these deals will officially close.\nA - Sam Samad: And Mike, good morning. Maybe I'll add a couple of comments just in terms of utilization. I mean, as we have been mentioning, utilization continues to be strong. We've seen it strong in Q1. We've seen it strong in Q2. The year-over-year compare in Q2 was maybe a little bit tougher versus Q2 of 2023. We had some lapping of some wins, and just overall we saw more of a resurgence in the base business in Q2 of last year. But in terms of the dynamics there, we do believe that both in terms of \u2013 there's strong utilization out there. We think some of it is return to care, but also just general strength of utilization by just additional testing, and that's reflected in the higher number of tests per req that we're seeing, but also we are gaining share. We do believe that we are gaining share, and we're gaining share through some of these also outreach acquisitions that we're doing that help us direct more testing to Quest.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Thanks for the question guys. Sam, maybe just to expand on the utilization piece. Obviously, you guys have seen pretty nice elevated levels there the past couple of quarters. Can you just talk about what you are seeing and then what the guide implies in terms of how you're feeling about it? I know previously, the guide just assumed normal utilization. Obviously, it stayed a little bit elevated here. And just how you are thinking about the trend? Does it gradually come down to normal? We'd love to just discuss that a bit. Thanks.\nSam Samad: Yeah, I mean, as we've talked about before Patrick, we do expect eventually utilization to level off to essentially what we've talked about in terms of our long-term growth algorithm, which is roughly around 3%-ish in terms of organic growth. And then as we said before, in terms of long-term growth, we expect 1% to 2% contribution from acquisitions. So we still think longer term, if you are thinking over the next, let's say, longer period. I'm not going to necessarily bracket it with a time period, but I think that's the right algorithm to be thinking about. In terms of for us, our current guide, right now at the midpoint we're saying total growth is close to 3%, 3.1%. Our base revenue guide is somewhere around 5% for the full year. Our second half, if you think about second half, that's essentially on the base revenue growth. It's about a 5.3% second half growth. Now recall the 5.3% in the second half, and this is revenue. It includes as we said, the majority of the $100 million take up of the guide is acquisitions. So in that 5.3% second half, there is a significant portion which is acquisitions. So in effect, if you look at just organic as Jim just alluded to, it's actually a slightly slower second half than what we saw in the first half. So embedded in that is the expectation Patrick, that this utilization doesn't continue at the same level, but starts to slow down a bit. So again, total growth, first half base \u2013 or sorry, full year base is 5%, second half base is 5.3%, but within that there's some acquisition, so the second half is closer to something between 3.5% to 4% in terms of base.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Westenberg of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nDavid Westenberg : Hi Noah. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to take it a little bit more of a long-term and look at the business here. How should we think about digital pathology, in light of the acquisition with PathAI? Can we see a more immediate path to incorporate it more broadly? If so, would there be cost savings in the intermediate term? And then, is there any maybe potential for pricing benefits given that a human plus AI kind of reading probably is a better outcome and so maybe would justify kind of a higher price and just as a background. Can you talk about maybe a broader framework for how much revenue of your business is pathology overall? Just anything you feel comfortable with. Thank you.\nJim Davis: Yeah, we said in the past, just on our revenue from anatomical pathology, that it was \u2013 and this was pre-PathAI diagnostics, said it was roughly a $500 million book of business. But we're excited about the digital pathology opportunity on numerous fronts. On the surface, unlike radiology, digital pathology does not naturally lower your cost, because you're actually, you still need to create the slide. Once you've created the slide, then you digitize the slide, okay, so there's actually an extra step in the process. Now here is where it creates productivity and as you said, we think better quality. Number one, we do anatomical pathology in over 20 locations across the country, because you want the pathologist to sit right near where you are preparing the slide, so that you don't have to move slides and vehicles and things like that. So we believe that it's going to \u2013 digital pathology will allow us to collapse the network of sites that actually do what we call the histology work or the preparation of the slides. So there will be cost savings when we collapse that network. Second is, it allows us to route the image to expert pathologists wherever they sit in the country. So if our guru for breast pathology sits on the west coast, you move those slides out there. If the prostate guru sits on the east coast, you move those slides there. So, and yes, we believe once you've digitized that slide, there's many companies out there that are working on algorithms. There's one or two that have been FDA approved that allow you to apply algorithmic analysis to the digital image in order to improve the quality of the read. In terms of reimbursement, we absolutely believe there's a strong case to be made for a higher reimbursement using these algorithms. The final thing I would tell you is that, with digital pathology, it opens up a realm of new just histology-only types of operations. Meaning, we will take on the histology work for a health system. They'll still keep the pathologists, but they'll shut down their histology operations. We'll do the slide preparation, digitize it, and send that back to the hospital pathologist for them still to do the reading. We call this a technical-only solution, and it's a solution that's starting to take off and the margins on the technical component of histology are quite good. So we're bullish on the overall market opportunity here.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErin Wright : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a two-parter here. On value-based care contracts, you mentioned that you lacked some of the payments that were made through those contracts or relationships last year. I guess how much did that benefit you last year and how should we be thinking about modeling that on a quarter-to-quarter basis? Will those incentive payments or contributions, are they relatively one-time in nature? Is that something you'll be breaking out for us going forward and how material have those payments been, I guess, year-to-date? And then a second part of my question would just be more on the regulatory environment. Just what you are thinking in terms of PAMA and SALSA and your expectations into 2025 on that front? Thanks.\nJim Davis: All right, so let me start with your value-based care comment. I'll ask Sam to add some color, and then I'll come back and address PAMA and SALSA. So, on the value-based care, it made positive contributions in the second quarter of this year. They just weren't bigger than the second quarter of last year. Last year we had a meaningful gain. We acknowledged that last second quarter. Again, this year it was positive, but the delta between last year and this year was a headwind for us. It is very difficult for us to give you guidance on how to model these things. There's really two principal components to these value-based payments. One is from shared savings from acquisitions, and those are lumpy. They are based on the acquisitions they do. And in some cases, payments can be six months post-deal closure. In some cases it could be a year post-deal closure. It just depends on the contract. The other type of value-based incentive payment that we have with some of our payers is around the movement of requisitions from high-priced, either out-of-network laboratories or high-priced health system laboratories. And again, that could be a once-a-year true-up, and depending on when we sign that contract, it could be in June, it could be in January, it could be in April, so very, very hard to model these things. So Sam, any other color on this.\nA - Sam Samad: I think you've really captured it, Jim. The key thing there Erin is, it's difficult to give you a sense as to how the pacing is going to be. We\u2019ve always said these are lumpy and sometimes there's also accounting nuances on these, where if it's a shared service, shared savings commitment for instance, we might accrue for that shared savings as if we're not going to achieve it, but then when we do achieve it, we have to release that accrual so to speak, and get a benefit in that quarter. Suffice it to say that these continue to be a positive for us in terms of our overall pricing in Q2 of 2024. It was a pricing or a positive benefit for us in the quarter, but on a year-over-year base, we had a significant benefit in Q2, 2023. So it impacted us negatively in terms of total revenues on a year-over-year basis. So I think everything that Jim said stands in terms of the difficulty of giving you a modeling algorithm for these. And then PAMA, Jim, did you want to comment?\nJim Davis: Yeah, in terms of PAMA in SALSA, while we continue to, we and our trade association and other independent labs continue to push the case for SALSA, we acknowledge it's going to be difficult to get that through in a year with an election year, especially now given many of the changes that occurred in the last week. Having said that, we will continue to push very hard for another one-year delay in PAMA. The recent CBO scoring on this was actually bigger than it was last year. They projected it would save the government over $3 billion. And in addition, the committee in the House that overlooks this is looking for a pay for program to pay for continued telehealth benefits. So this becomes a really nice pay for program that can satisfy the requirement to fund the telehealth. So we're confident that at a minimum that would be a one-year delay in PAMA, and hopefully we can get this done and figure it out in the October-November timeframe as opposed to waiting for the December timeframe like we've seen in the past.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jeffries. Your line is open, sir.\nBrian Tanquilut : Hey, good morning guys, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe Sam, as I think about your comments on Haystack, I understand maintaining the drag guidance for this year. But how are you thinking about the ramp on that as we think about 2025 and given some of the announcements you've made on new partnerships there? So just curious how we should be thinking about the development and the ramp of Haystack going forward? Thanks.\nA - Jim Davis: Yeah, sure. Good morning, Brian. So as we said in the prepared remarks, Haystack dilution this year will be somewhere in the $0.35 to $0.40 range, which is about a $0.20 increase in terms of dilution from prior year. For 2025 Brian, the way we see it is, it's still going to be dilutive, but it's going to be less dilutive than we see in 2024, because we will start to recognize revenues on the assay as we launch later this year. In 2026, we expect this \u2013 we expect Haystack to be slightly accretive. And we expect by the end of 2025 also to get to a positive return on invested capital from this acquisition. In terms of all the things that we've seen, the early launch has been really successful. We've had a very, very high interest in terms of number of key thought leaders and cancer centers that have signed up for this. So everything that we see today is really encouraging. And you touched on the partnerships that we've made as well. We continue to sign new partnerships in terms of cancer centers that are, or companies that are partnering with us to evaluate the use of the assay and MRD in a specific type of cancer. So really excited about the upcoming launch. I think the early launch has been very positive, and hopefully this gives you a sense as to the, you know the financial impact in terms of accretion dilution.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nLisa Gill : Thanks very much and good morning. Since you last reported the LDT rule that came out, can you maybe just talk about what the impact is there? I heard your comments on PAMA and SALSA, but anything else on the regulatory front that we should be aware of?\nJim Davis: Yeah, thanks Lisa. So as you know, our trade association filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court of Texas, District Court of Texas, and work by outside counsel that the trade association has retained. It continues \u2013 we expect movement in the case in the latter part of this year, November, December, and probably into January of next year. Having said that, the rule is in place. We are running the company and operating the company with the rule in place. There's certain requirements that we need to have in place by May of next year, including a complaint handling unit up and running, as well as the ability to report adverse events. And these capabilities, some of which we had in the company, some of which we have to add are ongoing as we speak. We continue, we've launched training for the organization, in particular our R&D teams, our product marketing teams around design controls. And again, we're living with the rule and implementing things for the directive of the FDA. We've said this year, it's not going to add a material cost into the business, but we continue to evaluate what we need to be fully compliant, especially if the lawsuit is not successful.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin : Hey. Thanks for taking the question guys. I'm going to stay on the regulatory side. It's still fairly recent, but we had a couple of questions coming from investors on Chevron deference, and the Supreme Court ruling to overturn the Chevron to outshine what could mean for deregulation. It's still kind of a hypothetical I think, but just curious what\u2019s your take on that, given your place in the industry.\nJim Davis: Well, it certainly doesn't hurt the case that we believe is in front of, again, the Federal District Court in Texas. I'm not a legal expert by any means, but as you know, look, Congress is the one that sets the operating parameters for various departments that exist like the FDA. We believe what Congress authorized the FDA to do, is to regulate medical devices. Congress also authorized the CLIA Act of 1988 that talked about the regulation of clinical laboratories. So we believe it's very clear what Congress intended. Obviously, others don't see it that way, but we do believe that yes, what has come out of the Supreme Court recently is favorable and clearly dictates what should occur within the four walls of regulatory bodies.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open, sir.\nJack Meehan : Thank you. Good morning. Either for Sam or for Jim, I was wondering if you could give an update on what you're seeing in terms of cost trends, how are wage costs trending, an update on turnover. And sorry if I missed this Sam, what's the full year margin target? Thank you.\nJim Davis: Yeah, so from a wage standpoint, we said at the beginning of the year that we expected wage increases to be in that 3% to 4% range. We're still operating within that 3% to 4%, so we're comfortable with that estimate for the back half of the year that it'll play out in that range. In terms of turnover, last year all-in for our frontline physicians, patient services, logistics, specimen processing, our laboratory workers, we were north of 20%. In the first quarter we came down below 20% into the mid-18s, and we kind of hung there in the second quarter. So we feel good that generally you can see an uptick sometimes after your first quarter, after bonus payments and things like that, but we've maintained a relatively flat position. We obviously have some hot spots around the country in certain job categories that tend to be competitive-related, either with health systems or with other industries. So we address those hot spots and we expect to make meaningful improvements in the back half of this year.\nSam Samad: Yeah, and for a margin target Jack, we didn't give one, so you didn't miss it. But we did say that operating margins are expected to be up year-over-year, which is what we had shared also on the Q1 call.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair.\nAndrew Brackmann : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Sam, maybe one for you, just on the balance sheet and the upcoming debt maturities. Anything that you can sort of share in terms of your expectations for timing or interest costs associated with those refinancing? And I guess just related to that, any color that you can provide on the debt assumptions for the LifeLabs acquisition. Thanks.\nSam Samad: Sure, Andrew, and good morning. So, let's start with the LifeLabs. What we are assuming, I mean, I shared in the prepared remarks that we expect the acquisition. First of all, we're not expecting LifeLabs to close this year, at least in our guidance assumptions. It could, but we're not assuming it's in guidance. But for 2025 it's a $0.10 to $0.15 EPS accretion, or at least in its first year, let's call it that. It's $0.10 to $0.15. We're assuming that it's funded by a combination of debt and cash. But within that assumption of $0.10 to $1.15 is that 75% of that purchase price is funded with debt. So the roughly $1 billion purchase price, 75% of it is debt funded, which is what drives the $0.10 to $0.15 accretion in the first year. In terms of just broadly on debt assumptions and liquidity, etcetera, I think here you talked about balance sheet assumptions. Listen, a lot of that is going to depend on market conditions and depend on the timing of the close of some of these acquisitions, not just LifeLabs, primarily LifeLabs, but also we have OhioHealth, Allina Health. We also closed PathAI in June. So as we've been talking about, we've had a busy M&A pipeline and it's starting to come to fruition. So we're going to evaluate market conditions. We've got the flexibility to access the capital markets. We've got very strong short term liquidity through the access to our facilities. But our goal continues to be to target a 2.5x to 3x leverage ratio, that's our goal. There could be some slight tip above that higher end of 3x, but then we expect to de-lever back to somewhere within that 2.5x to 3x in short time, given the growth and the accretion from these acquisitions. So again, no specific debt number right now, but we'll keep you posted as we get more timing on the closes of these acquisitions.\nShawn Bevec: Operator, next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Pito Chickering of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nPito Chickering: Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. A multi-part question here. How are volumes looking at from your preferred network customers versus everyone else? Looking at both the physician market and the hospital market, are you losing, gaining, or maintaining share? Any quantification of any of those would be helpful?\nJim Davis: Okay. So, on volume from our payers with preferred arrangements. The volume with several and of them Patrick, is higher. Now, some of that can be also driven by Medicare Advantage, the various size of the Medicare Advantage books of business. But in general, when we operate within these preferred networks where we have incentives in place to move, share from out-of-network labs, high-priced health systems, we definitely see benefits. In terms of market share statistics around our physician book of business and our health system book of business, it's hard to tell, right. There's just not great industry reports that talk about that. But I can tell you, when we said that that book of business was up 5.1% from a revenue standpoint, our physician growing faster than that, health system growing slightly lower than that, but still they are growing in ranges that are significantly above what we saw from a pre-COVID standpoint. So that leads us to believe, and also just based on the number of new wins with large physician groups, the number of new wins in our reference book of business, it leads us to believe that, yes, we are picking up share in this industry. Much of that share, we believe, is coming from health systems that potentially aren't as aggressive on some of that outreach book of business, from specialty labs and also from small, very small little regional labs.\nShawn Bevec : Operator, next question.\nOperator: We have time for one last question, and that is from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.\nStephanie Davis : Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter, and thank you for fitting me in. I was just curious if there's anything that's changed either the environment or maybe in strategy that had this pick up in M&A so much this year. And how sustainable is this or how much of this is to kind of strike them while the iron is hot? Thank you.\nJim Davis: Yeah, no change in the strategy at all Stephanie. And as we've been saying for many quarters in a row, the M&A funnel is full. Now, we don't go into a year planning on getting four deals announced in one quarter. It just, in fact, you would prefer to space these out a little bit, but there's always somebody on the other end that you are negotiating with, and these things sometimes take time. So, look, we're really excited about all of these. Allina Health in Minneapolis, it represents a market where the independent labs basically have really, really low share in that market space, so really excited about the Minneapolis marketplace. We're also very excited about Columbus, Ohio, dominated by two health systems, very difficult for independent labs to operate there, and so this gives us a substantial foothold within that Columbus marketplace. Obviously excited about the Canadian marketplace as we talked, and again, PathAI represents both, a nice opportunity in the Memphis marketplace itself, where we believe we can grow our book of business there. As well, it doesn't really matter where that lab is located, because a lot of the work is done digitally, so it accepts specimens from all over the country. I would tell you that there's still opportunities within the funnel. The emphasis continues to be on these outreach tuck-in deals. It continues to be in, to focus in markets where our share position or access to independent labs is waning, and that's where our focus will be in the second half of this year.\nSam Samad: One other thing I'd add, Stephanie, is all of these acquisitions that we announced meet our criteria. They basically hit the mark on all of the criteria that we have. Accretive in the first year, they meet our return on invested capital threshold. They meet our MPV criteria. So again, the activity would depend also that these acquisitions are going to hit our profitability criteria and our heroic hurdle rate, and they do.\nJim Davis: Okay, so that concludes our call today. We really appreciate everybody joining. Thanks for your support, and have a great week ahead.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics second quarter 2024 conference call.

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. In the second quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.4 billion, up 2.5% versus the prior year while base business revenues grew 3.8%. Organic base business revenues grew by 3.1%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were up 2.8% compared to the prior year reflecting strong growth in our base testing revenues partially offset by lower revenues from COVID-19 testing services. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.1% versus the second quarter of 2023 with acquisitions contributing 40 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 1.7% versus the prior year. Total revenue per requisition was up 1.6% versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per req and favorable test mix, partially offset by the timing of certain value-based arrangements in the second quarter of 2023 that did not repeat this year and lower COVID-19 testing. Base business revenue per req was up 2.4%. Unit price reimbursement was flat. Clinical base business revenues were up 5.1% while volumes grew 3.2%. This primarily reflects growth through our physician and hospital channels, which comprise approximately 90% of our total revenues, and excludes the impact of lower volumes primarily in our employer businesses providing workforce drug testing and employee population health services. Reported operating income in the second quarter was $355 million, or 14.8% of revenues, compared to $348 million, or 14.9% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $398 million, or 16.6% of revenues, compared to $389 million, or 16.7% of revenues last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to strong growth in the base business, partially offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues and wage increases. Reported EPS was $2.03 in the quarter compared to $2.05 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.35, versus $2.30 the prior year. Cash from operations was $514 million year-to-date through the second quarter versus $538 million in the prior year. Turning now to our updated full year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.5 billion and $9.58 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.57 to $7.77, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.80 to $9.00. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. Given the uncertainty around when the LifeLabs acquisition will close, we are not including this transaction in our updated 2024 guidance. However, in the first 12 months after closing the acquisition, we expect the transaction to generate approximately $710 million in annual revenues and to be slightly dilutive to GAAP EPS, due primarily to amortization of intangibles and other items, but approximately $0.10 to $0.15 accretive to adjusted EPS. These assumptions include the impact of expected debt financing to close the acquisition. With that said, the following are some key assumptions underlying our updated guidance for you to consider. The increase in our revenue guidance reflects the recently announced acquisitions of PathAI Diagnostics, Allina Health, and OhioHealth as well as the strength of our base business. The PathAI Diagnostics acquisition closed in June, while Allina Health and OhioHealth are expected to close in Q3. The revenue contribution from these acquisitions represents the majority of the increase in our updated revenue guidance. As a reminder, new acquisitions are typically breakeven to slightly profitable initially with profitability expanding over several quarters. Therefore, we are not expecting a material contribution to earnings from these acquisitions in 2024, but do expect increasing profitability next year. No change to our expectation for dilution from Haystack Oncology of an incremental $0.20 to adjusted EPS for the full year. Operating margin to expand for the full year, driven by volume growth and improved productivity. Net interest expense expected to be approximately $190 million. This does not include interest expense related to debt financing for the LifeLabs acquisition. Weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. Finally, our operations were affected by the worldwide IT outage last week, which limited our ability to collect and process specimens on Friday and through the weekend. Our labs were processing specimens by Friday afternoon, and the rest of our operations, including patient service centers, were largely restored to normal by yesterday morning. At this point, we estimate the IT outage and a minor impact from hurricane Beryl in Texas earlier this month could amount to a roughly $0.06 to $0.08 headwind on our Q3 earnings. This is currently reflected in our updated full year guidance. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. Maybe a couple of comments to add on the services businesses Ann, just to give you some financials behind them or at least some percentages. I mean, the Workforce Health Solutions businesses, Employer Population Health, and the Employer Solutions are less than 5% of our overall revenues. So just to give you a sense of bucketing of how much those businesses are. So they are not that material or not material to our overall revenues, but as Jim said, they have been impacted post-COVID somewhat significantly and with some of the market dynamics in the drug testing business, so they are impacting our growth rates. And then ExamOne is on top of that, but it's also impacted by some of the dynamics that Jim said coming out of COVID. So these businesses are down significantly year-over-year, but we don't expect further deterioration as we look forward. So there is a year-over-year impact, but we don't expect that to further amplify as we go forward. Yeah, so maybe I'll start Kevin, and Jim can add comments. First, let's kind of talk about the details in terms of what we shared. We said we're going to take up revenues by $100 million. We said we're going to take up EPS \u2013 and this is at the midpoint. We're going to take up EPS by $0.05 to $8.80 to $9. Within the $100 million that we talked about, the majority of that is really new M&A. So essentially M&A that we have signed, that we expect to close sometime between mid Q3 and the end of the year, and those reflect the M&A related to, or the transactions which are Allina Health, OhioHealth. We have some upside from PathAI as well, which we closed in Q2, but wasn't in our original guidance. So the revenue has a majority \u2013 the majority of the revenues is really driven by the M&A that we expect to close. The EPS increase is related to contribution from this M&A, although as we talked about in the prepared remarks, M&A ramps up in terms of profitability, so 2024, in the second half, very little contribution in terms of profitability from M&A. The remainder, I would say is contribution from the base business and some M&A, but little. And we are absorbing as you said, the impact of the IT outage, which is $0.06 to $0.08 in Q3 that we expect to, that we have now sized. This is preliminary. We'll get better detail as we go, but we are absorbing that impact. So, in terms of what's driving this improvement or the raise of EPS, we're basically continuing with a lot of the productivity work and the cost reductions that we have talked about. We have a lot of the AI and productivity improvements that Jim mentioned, a lot of the focus on improving margins. Importantly, base volumes continue to be very strong, and that's the biggest, I would say driver in terms of improved margins in the business. We continue to see base volumes be strong, utilization be strong. So really, that's the key driver. It's strength of volumes. It's continued productivity and cost improvements. It's also the fact that we have, as we've talked about many times over previous calls, a positive pricing and reimbursement environment, which is now stabilized, which is now flat to improving, as opposed to a negative price impact that we used to see in prior years. Yeah, I mean, as we've talked about before Patrick, we do expect eventually utilization to level off to essentially what we've talked about in terms of our long-term growth algorithm, which is roughly around 3%-ish in terms of organic growth. And then as we said before, in terms of long-term growth, we expect 1% to 2% contribution from acquisitions. So we still think longer term, if you are thinking over the next, let's say, longer period. I'm not going to necessarily bracket it with a time period, but I think that's the right algorithm to be thinking about. In terms of for us, our current guide, right now at the midpoint we're saying total growth is close to 3%, 3.1%. Our base revenue guide is somewhere around 5% for the full year. Our second half, if you think about second half, that's essentially on the base revenue growth. It's about a 5.3% second half growth. Now recall the 5.3% in the second half, and this is revenue. It includes as we said, the majority of the $100 million take up of the guide is acquisitions. So in that 5.3% second half, there is a significant portion which is acquisitions. So in effect, if you look at just organic as Jim just alluded to, it's actually a slightly slower second half than what we saw in the first half. So embedded in that is the expectation Patrick, that this utilization doesn't continue at the same level, but starts to slow down a bit. So again, total growth, first half base \u2013 or sorry, full year base is 5%, second half base is 5.3%, but within that there's some acquisition, so the second half is closer to something between 3.5% to 4% in terms of base. Yeah, and for a margin target Jack, we didn't give one, so you didn't miss it. But we did say that operating margins are expected to be up year-over-year, which is what we had shared also on the Q1 call. Sure, Andrew, and good morning. So, let's start with the LifeLabs. What we are assuming, I mean, I shared in the prepared remarks that we expect the acquisition. First of all, we're not expecting LifeLabs to close this year, at least in our guidance assumptions. It could, but we're not assuming it's in guidance. But for 2025 it's a $0.10 to $0.15 EPS accretion, or at least in its first year, let's call it that. It's $0.10 to $0.15. We're assuming that it's funded by a combination of debt and cash. But within that assumption of $0.10 to $1.15 is that 75% of that purchase price is funded with debt. So the roughly $1 billion purchase price, 75% of it is debt funded, which is what drives the $0.10 to $0.15 accretion in the first year. In terms of just broadly on debt assumptions and liquidity, etcetera, I think here you talked about balance sheet assumptions. Listen, a lot of that is going to depend on market conditions and depend on the timing of the close of some of these acquisitions, not just LifeLabs, primarily LifeLabs, but also we have OhioHealth, Allina Health. We also closed PathAI in June. So as we've been talking about, we've had a busy M&A pipeline and it's starting to come to fruition. So we're going to evaluate market conditions.

Accretive in the first year, they meet our return on invested capital threshold. They meet our MPV criteria. So again, the activity would depend also that these acquisitions are going to hit our profitability criteria and our heroic hurdle rate, and they do."

            "content": "Thanks Shawn and good morning, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter, with base business revenue growth of nearly 4% and total revenue growth of 2.5% as well as continued improvement in productivity and profitability in the base business. This performance is due to growth of new physician and hospital customers, more favorable test mix that includes greater adoption of advanced diagnostics and continued strength in healthcare utilization. We also made progress improving our operational quality and efficiency through greater use of automation and AI. In addition, we are excited to announce four acquisitions that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns, and that will enable us to expand in strategic growth areas. Our planned acquisition of LifeLabs, a trusted name in laboratory services for millions of Canadians, will enable us to grow in Canada, which has a population that is growing, and aging faster, than in the U.S. LifeLabs is especially strong in two of Canada's largest and fastest growing provinces, British Columbia and Ontario, which collectively account for about half of the country's population. We are familiar with the Canadian market, having delivered reference testing to many providers there for over 20 years. LifeLabs has been one of those reference partners for about a decade, so we know firsthand that their business, team and reputation is strong, and provides a solid foundation for growth. We expect to complete the transaction by the end of the year. Our recently announced acquisition of Select Lab Assets of Allina Health, a leading non-profit health system, will enable us to extend our reach in Minneapolis and throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. We also announced our plans to acquire the outreach lab assets of OhioHealth, a nationally recognized charitable health system in Ohio. Both transactions will broaden our presence in geographic areas of the United States where we've had limited access to providers due to the predominance of health systems. These acquisitions show our ability to attract and partner with top, growing health systems that share our commitment to expanding patient access to innovative and more affordable testing. We expect to complete both transactions in the third quarter. We also completed our acquisition of PathAI Diagnostics, which provides a readymade platform on which to scale digital pathology and AI to help health systems and other providers improve quality, speed and efficiency in cancer diagnosis. These acquisitions take time and involve teams of dedicated individuals. I want to personally thank my Quest colleagues for delivering on our M&A strategy, and we will now turn our attention to the hard work of integrating these deals. Now, I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the second quarter. Then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics, with an intense focus on faster growing clinical areas, including within brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver, with an emphasis on accretive outreach purchases as well as other independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business, with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are some updates on progress we have made in each of these areas. While we grew total volumes from Diagnostic Information Services 1.1% with base business volume growth of 1.7%, volumes from our base clinical business grew 3.2% in the second quarter, due to the strength among physicians and hospitals. In Physician lab services, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit base business revenue growth. This growth was driven by continued strength in healthcare utilization, as well as overall market growth, and share gains due to new customer wins. We drove favorable test mix as well as growth in test per requisition, which we attribute to greater utilization of our expanding portfolio of advanced diagnostics. Finally, we also saw strong volume and revenue growth within Medicare Advantage plans, where narrow network strategies direct testing to high quality, cost-efficient options like Quest. Our broad health plan access, which extends to approximately 90% of covered lives in the U.S., enabled us to take advantage of high demand for lab services, consistent with recent quarters. Health plans value our ability to improve access, scale innovation and drive costs out of healthcare. We are also working to develop opportunities to serve new geographies with our health plan partners. In Hospital lab services, we grew base business revenues by nearly 4%. Growth of reference testing remains higher than historical levels as hospitals struggled to fill open positions, especially in technical fields, such as histotechnology, microbiology and cytotechnology. Our advanced diagnostics portfolio provides a compelling alternative for hospitals to send us more reference work. Hospitals face several challenges, including high supply costs, high wages and decisions about how and where to deploy their capital. Patients want better value from lab services as well as easier access. Plus, diagnostic innovation is evolving at a fast pace. These dynamics are contributing to an accelerating trend of outreach acquisitions and professional lab service arrangements with the national labs. Our specialization and scale empower us to deliver a breadth of quality, innovative and accessible services that are often far more affordable for the patient. That's why top hospitals are choosing Quest for reference testing, professional lab services and outreach asset sales that deliver quality and efficiency. In consumer-initiated testing, our consumer facing platform, questhealth.com, grew total revenues nearly 40% while base business revenues grew more than 50% versus the prior year. As we learn more about our customers as our portfolio expands, we are improving growth and marketing productivity. Today, about 25% of our revenues are from existing customers and 20% of our revenues are from tests we introduced in the past year. In Advanced Diagnostics, several key clinical areas drove double-digit revenue growth, continuing the trend in recent quarters. This growth was particularly strong in brain health, women's health, particularly prenatal and hereditary genetics, and advanced cardiometabolic health. Our Alzheimer's disease portfolio was the primary driver of growth for our brain health offering. Demand was strong for our AD-Detect blood tests which assess risk based on amyloid, p-tau and APOE biomarkers. Demand was also strong for our CSF test options for aiding treatment decisions. Yesterday, we introduced our Neurofilament Light Chain test, which helps assess neuronal damage that may signify Alzheimer's disease as well as multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions. In molecular genomics and oncology, we are encouraged by early results of our Haystack MRD Early Experience program prior to the broad national launch later this year. Physicians from leading cancer institutions are using the Haystack MRD blood test to assess cancer recurrence and treatment response for a range of cancers, including colorectal, lung and breast. We also grew the body of evidence on the clinical and economic value of ctDNA blood testing in cancer care. A study published in JAMA Health Forum in June found that MRD testing could reduce costs for health plans, particularly commercial payers, by identifying patients that would benefit from chemotherapy after stage II colon cancer surgery. In addition, research presented at the June ASCO conference showed that Haystack MRD testing identified complete clinical response to immunotherapy for patients with colorectal cancer earlier than standard assessments, such as PET,MRI and endoscopy scans. Finally, we recently expanded our Haystack research collaborations to include Lisata Therapeutics, which will use Haystack MRD to study an investigational treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. Turning to advanced cardiometabolic testing, we are seeing interest in several biomarkers that improve early detection of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases like diabetes and kidney disease. These include insulin resistance, which can identify pre-diabetes risk before AIc tests, and ApoB, a more precise marker of heart attack risk than traditional lipid panels. They also include Lp(a), which is an inherited marker of heart disease risk found in up to 20% of the population and for which several therapies are now in development. Turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver a targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. During the quarter, we expanded our use of automation and AI in order to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. For instance, we advanced our use of automation in front-end specimen processing to now include five of our labs, freeing more of our processors to focus on value-added work. We also expanded our AI capabilities in microbiology to include the ability to segregate out specimens with no evidence of microbial growth so our medical scientists can concentrate on reviewing those with the greatest likelihood of disease. In addition, we broadened our use of AI in customer service to help our representatives access answers more quickly, improving their efficiency and service quality. Now, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam? Thanks, Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong total and base revenue growth across our core customer channels, due to strong commercial execution, innovative offerings and ongoing strength in healthcare utilization. We announced four acquisitions that meet our criteria for growth, profitability and returns and position us for growth in new geographic and service areas. We improved productivity as well as service levels and quality, through greater use of automation and AI. Finally, I'd like to personally thank my nearly 50,000 Quest colleagues for our strong performance this quarter, which is largely the result of the dedication, care and collaboration that they show patients, customers each and every single day. This commitment was exemplified by the tireless efforts of our teams to restore outstanding service for patients and customers this past weekend following the global IT outage. I'm proud to work with so many talented people committed to living our purpose, working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator. Yeah, good morning Ann. Let me start here. So, on the employer side, we have two principal businesses that serve employers. One is our Employee Drug Testing Business, second is our Employer Population Health business. There is a third business as you know called ExamOne that does health risk assessments for life insurance companies. Taken together, all three of those businesses showed meaningful declines in the quarter, and really largely represent the difference in the 3.2% that Sam referred too and the 1.7%. In the drug testing market, there's a couple of shifts going on. Number one, a lot of the job growth is still coming in the services industry, hotel workers, restaurant workers. A lot of those industries just have given up on drug testing. Other companies that still do drug testing, as you probably know, many have eliminated marijuana off the panel, so that has created some pressure. Then the final thing I'd tell you, is there's a shift going on in employee drug testing, where more companies are doing what we call on-site or oral testing, and if that test is positive, it eventually reflexes back to a central lab. But if it's a negative test, it's just an on-site screen and the employee passes and we don't get that work. On the Employee Population Health, we're just seeing companies not spend as much money on these wellness events that they've typically done in the past. Finally again, ExamOne, our life insurance business, that does risk assessments for life insurance. Just the life insurance policies, we saw a spike. During COVID people started to get life insurance again. Post-COVID, that negative trend has continued, which we were seeing actually pre-COVID. Now, let me turn to the Canada market for just a minute here. So look, there's a lot to like about the Canadian market. First of all, a population of roughly 41 million people. The population growth rate is actually faster than the U.S. The population growth there at about 1.1%. Here in the U.S., population growing less than 50 basis points. The aging of the population there as well is a good trend that we like and LifeLabs is really centered in two key markets, British Columbia and Ontario; Ontario being the biggest province in Canada, British Columbia being the second largest province. Collectively, those two provinces are over 50% or close to 50% of the Canadian population. We like the reimbursement model in Canada. It's steady. It's consistent. We think it will fill growth over the coming years. When we look at things like test per req, when we look at the types of testing done here in the U.S. versus Canada, we think there's opportunity to grow the types of testing that we bring into that market from an esoteric standpoint, from an advanced testing standpoint. So we feel great about entering the Canadian market. By the way, it's a market we know. We've served that market for many, many years as a reference provider. We've served LifeLabs, we've served other independent labs and hospital labs up in Canada. So we know the market, we're familiar with it, and we think it's a great opportunity for Quest Diagnostics. Yeah. Kevin, you probably saw a meaningful improvement in rev per rack in the quarter, and as Sam mentioned, within that rev per rack calculation, price per task, flat to last year. So the improvement is really coming in three areas. One, test per req continued to be very strong, north of four. Pre-COVID, that was a number that was south of four, it was in the threes. So that's a nice uptick, and that's coming from some of our advanced testing around allergy, tick testing, cardiometabolic testing, the neurology testing. And in that also is a mixed improvement that comes from some of those advanced tests. The final thing I'd say is, we saw again, strength in our overall Medicare Advantage and Medicare Book of Business. That pricing as you know, tends to be better than the average, and we also see more advanced tests coming on those requisitions versus our normal general health and wellness requisition. So we expect those trends to continue into the back half of the year, and that's contributing to the improvements that we're laying out there. Yeah, again, the 3.2% represents the volume growth that we see through what we call our core or base business. And that means our physician business, our hospital reference business, our hospital PLS business, and embedded in that is both clinical, as well as anatomical pathology. So that entire book of business, which is about 90% of the company, the volumes grew 3.2%. Down from Q1, but the compare in Q2 was higher. But again, the 3.2%, we feel really good about that. Now that 3.2% volume growth again translated into 5.1% revenue growth, and that was coming again on the strength of test mix plus the test per req increase that we've been seeing year-over-year. So we feel good about that, again, going into the second half of the year. In terms of the implied growth in the second half of the year, it's in the 3.7% revenue range. So again, and that's just the base or organic, that's without acquisition. The timing of the close of these acquisitions we've set in Q3 with Allina and OhioHealth, we just don't know when in Q3, okay, so there's still some uncertainty about when these deals will officially close. Yeah, we said in the past, just on our revenue from anatomical pathology, that it was \u2013 and this was pre-PathAI diagnostics, said it was roughly a $500 million book of business. But we're excited about the digital pathology opportunity on numerous fronts. On the surface, unlike radiology, digital pathology does not naturally lower your cost, because you're actually, you still need to create the slide. Once you've created the slide, then you digitize the slide, okay, so there's actually an extra step in the process. Now here is where it creates productivity and as you said, we think better quality. Number one, we do anatomical pathology in over 20 locations across the country, because you want the pathologist to sit right near where you are preparing the slide, so that you don't have to move slides and vehicles and things like that. So we believe that it's going to \u2013 digital pathology will allow us to collapse the network of sites that actually do what we call the histology work or the preparation of the slides. So there will be cost savings when we collapse that network. Second is, it allows us to route the image to expert pathologists wherever they sit in the country. So if our guru for breast pathology sits on the west coast, you move those slides out there. If the prostate guru sits on the east coast, you move those slides there. So, and yes, we believe once you've digitized that slide, there's many companies out there that are working on algorithms. There's one or two that have been FDA approved that allow you to apply algorithmic analysis to the digital image in order to improve the quality of the read. In terms of reimbursement, we absolutely believe there's a strong case to be made for a higher reimbursement using these algorithms. The final thing I would tell you is that, with digital pathology, it opens up a realm of new just histology-only types of operations. Meaning, we will take on the histology work for a health system. They'll still keep the pathologists, but they'll shut down their histology operations. We'll do the slide preparation, digitize it, and send that back to the hospital pathologist for them still to do the reading. We call this a technical-only solution, and it's a solution that's starting to take off and the margins on the technical component of histology are quite good. So we're bullish on the overall market opportunity here. All right, so let me start with your value-based care comment. I'll ask Sam to add some color, and then I'll come back and address PAMA and SALSA. So, on the value-based care, it made positive contributions in the second quarter of this year. They just weren't bigger than the second quarter of last year. Last year we had a meaningful gain. We acknowledged that last second quarter. Again, this year it was positive, but the delta between last year and this year was a headwind for us. It is very difficult for us to give you guidance on how to model these things. There's really two principal components to these value-based payments. One is from shared savings from acquisitions, and those are lumpy. They are based on the acquisitions they do. And in some cases, payments can be six months post-deal closure. In some cases it could be a year post-deal closure. It just depends on the contract. The other type of value-based incentive payment that we have with some of our payers is around the movement of requisitions from high-priced, either out-of-network laboratories or high-priced health system laboratories. And again, that could be a once-a-year true-up, and depending on when we sign that contract, it could be in June, it could be in January, it could be in April, so very, very hard to model these things. So Sam, any other color on this. Yeah, in terms of PAMA in SALSA, while we continue to, we and our trade association and other independent labs continue to push the case for SALSA, we acknowledge it's going to be difficult to get that through in a year with an election year, especially now given many of the changes that occurred in the last week. Having said that, we will continue to push very hard for another one-year delay in PAMA. The recent CBO scoring on this was actually bigger than it was last year. They projected it would save the government over $3 billion. And in addition, the committee in the House that overlooks this is looking for a pay for program to pay for continued telehealth benefits. So this becomes a really nice pay for program that can satisfy the requirement to fund the telehealth. So we're confident that at a minimum that would be a one-year delay in PAMA, and hopefully we can get this done and figure it out in the October-November timeframe as opposed to waiting for the December timeframe like we've seen in the past. Yeah, thanks Lisa. So as you know, our trade association filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court of Texas, District Court of Texas, and work by outside counsel that the trade association has retained. It continues \u2013 we expect movement in the case in the latter part of this year, November, December, and probably into January of next year. Having said that, the rule is in place. We are running the company and operating the company with the rule in place. There's certain requirements that we need to have in place by May of next year, including a complaint handling unit up and running, as well as the ability to report adverse events. And these capabilities, some of which we had in the company, some of which we have to add are ongoing as we speak. We continue, we've launched training for the organization, in particular our R&D teams, our product marketing teams around design controls. And again, we're living with the rule and implementing things for the directive of the FDA. We've said this year, it's not going to add a material cost into the business, but we continue to evaluate what we need to be fully compliant, especially if the lawsuit is not successful. Well, it certainly doesn't hurt the case that we believe is in front of, again, the Federal District Court in Texas. I'm not a legal expert by any means, but as you know, look, Congress is the one that sets the operating parameters for various departments that exist like the FDA. We believe what Congress authorized the FDA to do, is to regulate medical devices. Congress also authorized the CLIA Act of 1988 that talked about the regulation of clinical laboratories. So we believe it's very clear what Congress intended. Obviously, others don't see it that way, but we do believe that yes, what has come out of the Supreme Court recently is favorable and clearly dictates what should occur within the four walls of regulatory bodies. Yeah, so from a wage standpoint, we said at the beginning of the year that we expected wage increases to be in that 3% to 4% range. We're still operating within that 3% to 4%, so we're comfortable with that estimate for the back half of the year that it'll play out in that range. In terms of turnover, last year all-in for our frontline physicians, patient services, logistics, specimen processing, our laboratory workers, we were north of 20%. In the first quarter we came down below 20% into the mid-18s, and we kind of hung there in the second quarter. So we feel good that generally you can see an uptick sometimes after your first quarter, after bonus payments and things like that, but we've maintained a relatively flat position. We obviously have some hot spots around the country in certain job categories that tend to be competitive-related, either with health systems or with other industries. So we address those hot spots and we expect to make meaningful improvements in the back half of this year. Okay. So, on volume from our payers with preferred arrangements. The volume with several and of them Patrick, is higher. Now, some of that can be also driven by Medicare Advantage, the various size of the Medicare Advantage books of business. But in general, when we operate within these preferred networks where we have incentives in place to move, share from out-of-network labs, high-priced health systems, we definitely see benefits. In terms of market share statistics around our physician book of business and our health system book of business, it's hard to tell, right. There's just not great industry reports that talk about that. But I can tell you, when we said that that book of business was up 5.1% from a revenue standpoint, our physician growing faster than that, health system growing slightly lower than that, but still they are growing in ranges that are significantly above what we saw from a pre-COVID standpoint. So that leads us to believe, and also just based on the number of new wins with large physician groups, the number of new wins in our reference book of business, it leads us to believe that, yes, we are picking up share in this industry. Much of that share, we believe, is coming from health systems that potentially aren't as aggressive on some of that outreach book of business, from specialty labs and also from small, very small little regional labs. Yeah, no change in the strategy at all Stephanie. And as we've been saying for many quarters in a row, the M&A funnel is full. Now, we don't go into a year planning on getting four deals announced in one quarter. It just, in fact, you would prefer to space these out a little bit, but there's always somebody on the other end that you are negotiating with, and these things sometimes take time. So, look, we're really excited about all of these. Allina Health in Minneapolis, it represents a market where the independent labs basically have really, really low share in that market space, so really excited about the Minneapolis marketplace. We're also very excited about Columbus, Ohio, dominated by two health systems, very difficult for independent labs to operate there, and so this gives us a substantial foothold within that Columbus marketplace. Obviously excited about the Canadian marketplace as we talked, and again, PathAI represents both, a nice opportunity in the Memphis marketplace itself, where we believe we can grow our book of business there. As well, it doesn't really matter where that lab is located, because a lot of the work is done digitally, so it accepts specimens from all over the country. I would tell you that there's still opportunities within the funnel. The emphasis continues to be on these outreach tuck-in deals. It continues to be in, to focus in markets where our share position or access to independent labs is waning, and that's where our focus will be in the second half of this year. Okay, so that concludes our call today. We really appreciate everybody joining. Thanks for your support, and have a great week ahead."

Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Now here is Jim Davis.\nJim Davis: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered nearly 6% base business revenue growth, continuing the strong momentum of recent quarters. We also grew total revenues for the first time since the height of the pandemic nearly three years ago. Our strong commercial focus on physicians and hospitals, combined with our broad health plan access, enabled us to take advantage of sustained high rates of healthcare utilization and drive new customer growth. Our investments in advanced diagnostics also enabled double-digit growth within multiple key clinical areas, including brain health, women's health, and advanced cardiometabolic health. In addition, our Invigorate initiative, which includes ongoing investments in automation and AI, continued to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. Given the strength of our business, we are raising our guidance for the full year. Before turning to highlights from the quarter, I'd like to briefly discuss the FDA's proposed rule to regulate laboratory-developed testing services. We still encourage the administration to withdraw the proposed rule and engage in advancing appropriate legislation that preserves the critical role of laboratory diagnostics. We are disappointed that the FDA continues to move forward with this regulation, which we believe, if enacted, will compromise patient access to critical lab testing, slow diagnostic innovation, and add unnecessary healthcare costs. We also believe that the rule raises serious legal issues, including that the FDA lacks the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate these services. While we will be prepared to comply with the rule, we will continue to work with our trade association, ACLA, on potential next steps. Now I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the first quarter. Then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals, and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver, with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller, independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business, with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are a few key updates on the progress we've made in each of these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered high single-digit based business revenue growth driven by sustained high healthcare utilization, overall market growth and share gains. This growth also reflects new customer wins and our strengthening relationships with physician practices of all sizes, including large multi-specialty physician groups and those owned by large retailers. A significant driver of our success in the physician channel is our broad health plan access, as approximately 90% of health plan members in the U.S. have access to laboratory services at Quest Diagnostics. Health Plans value our size, scale, and innovation. We partner closely with them to reduce laboratory costs through programs that redirect volume from hospital outreach labs and out-of-network labs, which often charge significantly higher prices than we do, raising healthcare costs for patients and employers. We also remain disciplined in our pricing strategy as we increase our investments in improving the customer experience, such as through digital platform enhancements and adjustments to Frontline Pay. As we highlighted previously, we successfully renegotiated our large health plan contracts that were up for renewal last year. In addition, more than 50% of our health plan revenues now have some type of value-based incentive. In Physician Services, our recent acquisition of Lenco, an independent lab in New York, also contributed to growth in the quarter. Our M&A pipeline continues to be robust, and we are making progress with several promising opportunities. In Hospital Lab Services, we grew base business revenues by mid-single digits. Hospital reference testing, in particular, continued to grow faster than pre-pandemic trends, maintaining the momentum from last year. Hospitals are sending us more reference testing, largely because of our innovation, our quality, and our value. They also face persistent challenges with staffing certain roles in specialized fields like histology, microbiology, and cytotechnology, which we can more easily fill with our talent and our technology. In general, as hospitals face both staffing and cost challenges, they continue to reevaluate their lab strategies. Additionally, as the cost of capital continues to rise, some are revisiting their investment priorities and are directing more capital into other clinical areas that generate better returns. Quest provides hospitals with a range of ways to help optimize lab operations, whether through reference testing, savings and efficiencies through professional lab services, or access to capital by selling their outreach programs. Many hospitals and health system leaders are approaching us with a heightened sense of urgency for help with their lab strategies. As a result, our pipeline of both PLS and outreach opportunities remains very strong. Consumer-initiated testing revenues grew double digits, while base business revenues nearly doubled, building on the gains that we delivered last year from our consumer-facing platform, questhealth.com. Some of our most popular test categories included general health panels, STDs, and tuberculosis testing. We also continue to expand our test menu, such as with our launch of PFAS testing for assessing potential exposure to dangerous forever chemicals, and are extending our reach through various channel partners. In Advanced Diagnostics, we generated strong double-digit revenue growth within several key clinical areas, including brain health, women's health, particularly prenatal and hereditary genetics, and advanced cardiometabolic health. Growth in brain health was driven largely by our Alzheimer's disease portfolio of tests, which includes our Quest AD-Detect blood tests for early risk assessment of Alzheimer's disease and our CSF Tests for diagnosing and monitoring. We are launching our Quest AD-Detect pTau-217 blood test to providers this week, and we intend to add additional biomarkers this year to further expand our menu. In molecular genomics and oncology, we completed the validation of our Haystack MRD test in March and have oversubscribed our Haystack MRD Early Experience Program with nearly 20 leading cancer institutions as participants. The Early Experience Program is the final step to prepare for our broad national launch of the clinical test later this year. We are also excited about the opportunities in early blood-based cancer screening. This quarter, our Lewisville, Texas site received the first specimens for the PROMIS Clinical Trial on a liquid biopsy screening test for colorectal cancer from our partner, Universal DX. We look forward to supporting Universal's efforts to gain U.S. regulatory approval for this test. Lastly, our STEP500 somatic tumor sequencing service, which helps providers select therapy for late-stage cancers based on tumor mutation profiles, is generating interest from large cancer centers. Our investments in cancer screening, treatment selection, and monitoring are positioning us to be a leader in the MRD space and other fast-growth molecular genomics and oncology markets. Turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver a targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. During the quarter, we continued to deploy automation and AI to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. For instance, we made progress creating what we term a digital front door, which will use AI in our website and service center kiosks to answer basic questions from patients, reducing workload on Phlebotomist and calls to our customer service team. We also recently automated elements of the specimen preparation process in several labs and expect to deploy these systems across other sites in 2024. These systems make our front-end operations more efficient and improve quality while also freeing our employees to focus on other value-added work. Finally, I'd like to personally thank my Quest colleagues for delivering a superior customer experience. Our industry just celebrated Lab Week, which reminds us of the key role labs play at the heart of healthcare. I'm proud that our nearly 50,000 employees bring Quest's purpose to life every day. Working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam?\nSam Samad : Thanks, Jim. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.37 billion, up 1.5% versus the prior year, while base business revenues grew nearly 6%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were up 1.7% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong growth in our base testing revenues, partially offset by lower revenues from COVID-19 testing services. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.6% versus the first quarter of 2023, with acquisitions contributing 60 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 3.3% versus the prior year, despite the impact of severe weather in the first two weeks of January. During the quarter, weather negatively impacted volume growth by approximately 30 basis points. Revenue per requisition was up slightly versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per rec and favorable test mix, largely offset by lower COVID-19 testing. Base business revenue per rec was up 2.6% due to an increase in the number of tests per rec and favorable test mix. Unit price reimbursement was flat. Reported operating income in the first quarter was $300 million, or 12.7% of revenues, compared to $305 million, or 13.1% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $349 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $350 million or 15% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income was relatively consistent versus the prior year due to strong growth in the base business, largely offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases, and higher benefit costs. Reported EPS was $1.72 in the quarter compared to $1.78 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.04, flat versus the prior year. Cash from operations was $154 million in the first quarter versus $94 million in the prior year. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we repaid $300 million of senior notes which matured on April 1st. Turning to our updated full year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.4 billion and $9.48 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.57 to $7.82, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.72 to $8.97. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. The following are some key assumptions underlying our guidance to consider as you update your models. COVID-19 testing revenues to decline approximately $175 million for the full year. In terms of M&A, our guidance only includes acquisitions that have been announced or closed to-date. No change to our expectation for dilution from Haystack Oncology of an incremental $0.20 to adjusted EPS for the full year. Operating margin to expand for the full year driven by volume growth and improved productivity. Net interest expense to be approximately $190 million. Weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. While we are only one quarter into the year, given the strong volume trends in Q1, we have raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint, which more than offsets the $0.05 to $0.07 headwind we experienced from weather in January. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim.\nJim Davis: Thanks, Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong revenue growth across our core customer channels, physicians, hospitals, and consumers, building on trends from 2023. Our strong customer relationships, broad health plan access, and investments in advanced diagnostics are enabling us to take advantage of sustained high healthcare utilization and drive new customer growth. We are steadily improving productivity as well as service levels and quality, giving us confidence in improved profitability in 2024. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question for today will come from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open, sir.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I want to focus on the margins Sam. Obviously, a big story throughout last year. Nice to see them come in a little bit better than expected this quarter. Can you talk about the moving pieces? It sounds like Haystack was as expected in terms of the dilution for the year. You are kind of maintaining that expectation. But can you talk about the better performance this quarter and then expectations as we work our way through the year, the right way to think about the cadence there? I just want to make sure we have that metric kind of ironed out as we think about the progress as we work our way through 2024 here.\nJim Davis : Yeah, sure Patrick, and good morning. So maybe the best way to look at it is think about it in terms of year-over-year. We were 14.8% operating margins in Q1 of this year compared to 15% last year. So some moving parts for you to consider and think about, because you can look at this in many different ways. But versus last year, obviously a big headwind in terms of COVID, both in terms of volumes, but also price. We had $90 million less COVID this quarter versus last year same quarter, at a much lower price as well, because we were getting reimbursed at $100 price back then. If you think about other smaller headwinds, I mean Haystack as you said, we still expect it to be $0.20 incremental dilution versus last year for the full year, well you saw that in Q1. But then offsetting these headwinds, the biggest one being COVID, was base volume growth and productivity improvement. So we actually offset almost the majority of the COVID headwind through base improvement in terms of margins. The consumer-initiated testing business also expanded operating margins as well. We continue to see great momentum in that business and good improvement in profitability. Our base gross margins actually improved quite significantly from Q1 of last year, so very encouraged by the start that we've had and the momentum that we see going forward. In terms of cadence, I think to answer your second question, it's I'd say normal seasonality that you would expect going forward. A step up in Q2 in terms of operating margins, maybe consistent operating margins to Q2 and Q3, and then a step down in Q4, which is, I would say normal pre-COVID seasonality for us. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Yes. The next question will come from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nAnn Hynes: Great, thanks. Good morning. So you beat consensus by 11%, but only raised EPS by 1% \u2013 I mean, I'm sorry 1%. Can you tell us what Q1 came in versus your internal expectations? And should we view that differential as conservatism, or is it something else we should consider as we model? Thanks.\nSam Samad : So let me start, Ann. Thank you for the question by the way. This is Sam, and Jim if you want to add anything as well, by all means. We beat in Q1, both in terms of versus external expectations, but also versus our own internal expectations. So we came in better. We had called out at the beginning of the year on the Q4 earnings call that we expect to see a $0.05 to $0.07 headwind from weather, in terms of EPS headwind from weather. That was at the time driven by the fact that really the first two weeks, three weeks of January were quite tough for us in terms of utilization and in terms of weather. We offset a significant portion of that. I mean, you heard on the prepared remarks that we had a 30 basis point headwind impact as a result of weather, but really we offset most of the headwinds in terms of the EPS impact. So the $0.05 to $0.07, largely we feel good that that's behind us and that's essentially taken off the table. So we felt comfortable increasing our EPS by $0.10 at the midpoint. Now, we're only in the second quarter here. We still have three quarters to go. Utilization was really strong, especially base business utilization in the first quarter. We're expecting in the next three quarters that we go back to, I would say, more normal utilization, not what we saw in Q1. So that's what our EPS range is also driven by. But I would say very pleased with the beat that we had in Q1 and taking the weather headwind off the table.\nJim Davis : Yeah. The only thing I'd add Ann, is that the volume growth was broad-based. We saw it across all physician channels and we saw it in health systems as well. So it did beat our internal expectations after a slow start in January. It came back very nicely in February and March and we finished strong.\nAnn Hynes : Great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo : Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to ask a little bit about LDT. I'm sure you\u2019re hoping that the ruling was going to come out before you reported, so that you can actually address it. But maybe talk a little bit, now that you've had some time to go over the initial proposal and maybe what you are expecting in the final proposal? Maybe can you let us know about the scope of the tests that you think are going to be included, and any sort of financial implications that you might have for fiscal \u201824? Did it change the way you were guiding? Is there anything in the guidance for this? And maybe how you think it plays out with regards to, are you going to try to get an injunction or anything like that through an ACLA?\nJim Davis : Yeah. So thanks, Kevin. So look, we don't know what the final rule is yet. We've all seen the proposed rule. It largely follows 21 CFR Part 820, which is the regulated device code. So we're preparing for it, but let me just tell you, look, we start with a strong quality management system and a very strong quality organization in Quest Diagnostics today. As you know we follow the CLIA guidelines. CLIA was implemented in 1988. It's a very robust and strict set of guidelines that we follow, and we feel good about that. I would also tell you that myself and many other people in Quest Diagnostics have come from regulated device manufacturing companies in the healthcare space, so we know what to do, we know how to do it. Certainly there's gaps between what CLIA recommends and what 21 CFR recommends, and we'll address those gaps once we know what the final rule is, but we'll be prepared. There's not going to be any impact on earnings or EPS here in 2024. As you know the timeframe laid out was a three to four year timeframe. So we'll address this in a thoughtful way. We'll be prepared, and we've got the confidence and quality organization in place to do it.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTaji Phillips : Good morning. You've got Taji on for Brian. Thank you for taking my question. So first, just on the M&A contribution, obviously called out 60 basis points, contribution to total volume. Just curious, is the 50 basis point expectation for the full year contribution to revenue still stand? Thank you.\nJim Davis : Well, if we don't do any other acquisitions this year, then yes, the 50 basis point trend will continue for the following quarters. But, as we mentioned in the script, our funnel is good, it's robust and we would expect to close some additional transactions this year. But timing is involved and these things do take time. We're cautiously optimistic.\nSam Samad : Yeah, just to be clear, our consistent approach is always going to be, that we will include in the guidance that we provide only the things that have been announced and our carryover acquisitions. So, anything that we haven't announced will not be included in our guidance. To Jim's point, if we do close any other transactions, we will include them in our guidance perspective going forwarded.\nOperator: The next question will come from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErin Wright : Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask on just the broader advanced diagnostic segment. How that's tracking relative to kind of internal expectations. You've made advances in areas like Alzheimer's, for instance and now you did Haystack acquisition. Can you talk a little bit about potential holes in your offering that you see as opportunities? And then on the Haystack front, just what's the next catalyst on that front? Thanks.\nJim Davis : Yeah. So, from an advanced diagnostic standpoint, it certainly met and even exceeded our expectations here in the quarter. So, let me talk about brain health first. The uptake of our AB 42/40 test, which is a blood-based test for amyloid plaque has again exceeded expectations. We're really, really pleased with how that test is doing. We announced yesterday in a press release that we've added a p-tau217. We had already introduced p-tau181. So we feel like the brain health blood-based portfolio is in great shape. The CSS side of the portfolio continues to do well as well. On the women's healthcare side, prenatal genetics and carrier screening are doing very well. We continue to see double-digit growth there. With respect to Haystack, as you know, it's still pre-revenue, but we are about to embark on what we call our early experience program. We said in the script that we were oversubscribed. We saw it somewhere between 15 and 20 partners to start the program with, and we filled that up a lot more quickly than we thought and had to cut it off at 20 customers. So, feel good about that. We're going to run that early experience program for the next several months, which will position us for a broader national launch later in the quarter. So, feeling good about the contribution of advanced diagnostics across our portfolio of tests.\nOperator: The next question will come from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nMichael Cherny : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe, Sam, if I can turn back to the guidance you talked about, the dynamics of utilization and the expectation that it will be a slightly more normal environment. As you think about that, how does that factor into your expectations for organic volume, not only on the total number, but also on mix and how that...\nSam Samad: Hey, Mike, sorry. We kind of lost you for two seconds there. Can you please repeat the question? Because I missed a portion of it.\nMichael Cherny : Is this better?\nSam Samad: Yes, this is much better. Thank you.\nMichael Cherny : Okay, I'm going to try to fix my headset after this. Apologize for that. So, it's a question just on the dynamics of what's ingrained in the organic volume expectations, is included both from a normalization of the market, but also a mixed perspective and how that factors into your expectations for margin expansion, and where are the push and pull points that will allow you to make sure you hit the margin expansion versus areas that you could potentially fall short?\nSam Samad : Yeah, I can start, and by all means, Jim you can add some color as well. I think as Jim talked about earlier, Mike, we've got some areas within advanced diagnostics that are growing in the double digits, which really helps us from growing some of the key tests that we have in that portfolio, and also helps us from profitability standpoint as well. But overall base volumes, we grew in revenues 5.7%, grew less than that in volumes in Q1. Our expectation is that we're growing in the sort of close to mid-single digits, maybe slightly below that in terms of volumes, and that drives a lot of productivity and improvement in terms of our margins as we look forward. So, both in terms of mix and some of these advanced diagnostics tests that we have, but also in terms of volume growth overall for the remaining three quarters, we expect that to drive an improvement in terms of productivity. Now remember, we are \u2013 in the next three quarters, we're not assuming that we continue at the same level and same rate of whether you call it base revenue growth and maybe to some extent base clinical volume growth. We do expect that some of this \u2013 as utilization starts to come down and normalize. Maybe that's a conservative assumption, not sure, but at this point, we're more comfortable saying that it's going to be, volume growth is going to be closer to that, just slightly lower than mid-single digits. Jim, anything you would add there?\nJim Davis : Yeah, I would just say, the mix in the quarter was really good. On a total basis, so all in, even with COVID we still had 10 basis points of growth from a rev-per-rec standpoint, pricing relatively flat. So it suggests that test-pa rec and test-mix were really, really strong. Remember, that offset, as Sam said in the script, $90 million worth of COVID decline. COVID that last year was at $100 per test. So, we completely offset that from a mix standpoint and still saw growth in rev-per-rec. So, really happy with the mix that we saw in the quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I was hoping you could unpack the core growth a little bit more. So, nearly 6% that was a 3% beat versus what I was looking for. Historically, the lab has been a pretty steady business. So, to post a beat like this, it's pretty notable. Can you just lay out the factors for why maybe outside of core utilization growth came in a lot stronger in the quarter? Any thoughts on share gains? Was that a dynamic? Thanks.\nJim Davis : I think it's all of the above, Jack. Certainly, the utilization remains strong, consistent with what we've seen in the last three or four quarters. But, we also said that, yeah, we think we're picking up share. We closed several large transactions with two integrated large physician groups in the quarter. Our core physician volume growth was strong. Our hospital reference growth was strong. Our PLS volume relatively strong in the quarter. So, that suggests utilization in hospitals was also up, and our pathology business contributing as well to growth. So, we see it across all physician types, all physician channels, retailers, as well as these large physician groups. It's a combination of utilization plus share gain.\nSam Samad : Yeah, and Jack, this is Sam. I'll mention one other thing as well. If you're looking at overall base business growth, I mean, the Quest Health Consumer-Initiated Testing business as well was a very good strength and tailwind in the quarter. Basically, that base business excluding COVID almost doubled in the quarter \u2013 year-over-year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson : Hi guys. Maybe a slight two-parter for me. First just to pick up Sam, what you were just saying about the consumer business. Can you talk about when you sort of think about, how you think about the margin progression of that and sort of like what your expectations are for that to get more towards the corporate average? And then secondarily, could you just comment on the continued labor environment? How are you seeing sort of wages and turnover versus the prior quarter? Thank you.\nSam Samad : Yeah. Hey, I'll address both. So the margins on our consumer business are consistent with the margins in the overall business. So, it's right there. It's at the meeting for the company and it continued to improve all last year and so feel good about that. In terms of the labor environment, we definitely saw a tick down or a tick up, let's just say, in our retention rates. Not yet back to pre-COVID levels, but below in the high teens, below the 20% threshold that we were running at last year. So, we feel good about that. We saw a downward tick in logistics attrition, our specimen processing. It was across the board. All front-line jobs improved in the quarter and feel good about the direction that that's moving in.\nOperator: The next question comes from Lisa Gill of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nLisa Gill : Thanks very much. Good morning. In your prepared comments, you talked about 50% of health plans now having some type of value-based care arrangement. Can you maybe just give us an example of what that looks like and talk about what that means to the margin?\nJim Davis : Yeah. So we call it value-based incentives is what we're talking about here. Generally there is two types. So, one is related to acquisitions. So when we acquire an outreach book of business, and let's say the health plan was paying that health system 200% to 300% of Medicare, it is not going to come down to the rates that we are contracted with that health plan with on day one. It will step down over time. In fact, there's \u2013 again, since it doesn't step right down to our rate, we're getting paid a higher price for that work over some period of time. The second incentive types are broad-based or types of incentives are really related to volume movement. So, movement of high-priced requisitions from health system laboratories or from out-of-network laboratories into Quest Diagnostics. In essence, you're getting paid for share gains at that health plan that are tied to share gains coming from, moving those requisitions from, again, health systems and out-of-network labs. So, really those are the two types of value incentives that we get.\nLisa Gill : Just to confirm, there's no impact from the change cyber-attack at all on Quest in the quarter?\nJim Davis : No, less than 2% of our requisitions were ever moving through those pipes from an adjudication standpoint. There's somewhere between a $15 million and $20 million cash impact, but no revenue impact in the quarter.\nSam Samad : And just to be clear, the cash impact is really a delay, not necessarily any impact to revenue.\nLisa Gill : Okay, great. Thanks for the comment.\nOperator: This question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Your line has opened, sir.\nMichael Ryskin : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. I want to follow up on an earlier point you touched on, the COVID headwind that you overcame in the quarter and just how to think about price for the rest of the year. So as you said, impressive that you saw revenue for requisition growth, despite some of that headwind. How should we think about that through the rest of the year? I mean, and again, that's kind of a two-parter in terms of COVID headwinds and fading as you go through the year and then the pricing benefit. You had some major health plan renegotiation that concluded last year. Is that what's driving some of that growth and anything else in that arena that we should be thinking of for the rest of the year? Thanks.\nJim Davis : Yeah, so let me start and then I'll let Sam make some comments. So, remember, in the rev-rec calculation, there's multiple moving parts here. The first one is pure price. We said it was flat in the quarter and we expected to be flattish for the rest of the year. We also said in the rev-rec calculation is test-per-rec \u2013 test-per-rec, test-mix, and then payer-mix. Test-per-rec, positive in the quarter, we expect that to continue. Test-mix was favorable in the quarter. We expect that to continue. So all told, we like the trend that we saw in the first quarter. Now, there's always puts and takes as we move through each quarter and, we'll have to see how it plays out. But Sam, do you?\nSam Samad: Yeah, I mean, I'll add maybe a couple of things. First of all, the COVID point, Michael, COVID is not really material for the rest of the year. We said for the full year, it's going to be a $175 million decline. We've had $90 million of that decline happen in Q1. So, the biggest impact really was going to be felt in Q1. But yeah, there is a price impact related to it, given the fact that \u2013 a small, minor price impact, actually, because the price went down middle of May last year. So really it's a minor price impact. Then just a little bit of color on the pricing dynamics. As Jim said, it's flattish for the full year in terms of price impact. If you look at the ingredients within that, the health plans, we expect them to be, modestly up in terms of price. The health systems is a negative impact in terms of price. Then we have some other businesses where we've had some price increases that helps. So overall, I think the net neutral in terms of price impact for the year.\nMichael Ryskin : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Stephanie Davis of Barclays. Your line is open.\nStephanie Davis : Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my question. You touched a bit on the automation opportunity in your centers in your prepared remarks. So I was hoping you could help us tease out what the mix of the cost structure looks like in the centers. How should we think about the Phlebotomy talent that would be difficult to improve with AI solutions, versus how much of that cost is more admin or front desk and could have that AI opportunity coming up?\nJim Davis: Well, Stephanie, we've always said that about 50% of the cost structure in the company is wages, labor and within the laboratories, it's obviously higher than that. Within the Phlebotomy, it's mostly a people expense, although there's supplies and rent for our patient service centers. I would say in the laboratories, much of the automation efforts continue in the specimen processing area, what we call sorting, aliquoting, pouring off tubes of urine, and things like that. That's where our automation efforts continue to pay dividends for us. On the Phlebotomy side, as I mentioned, yes, it's a highly labor-intensive operation. Now, in a typical 10 to 12 minute draw time, there's still probably five to six minutes of that time doing manual paperwork, computer entry type of stuff. The biggest opportunity there to improve that is still the movement from paper requisitions to electronic requisitions. What still comes into our patient service center today is 35% to 45% paper that we end up having to input that information into our Quest system. So we work back through the physician offices that send us that paper and try to convert that. I would tell you also, we're working on some other kits that could allow for some self-draw. So these are early stages, early stage development. But, we continue to work on some other things that should make our Phlebotomy staff even more productive.\nOperator: And our final question.\nStephanie Davis : Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question of today, will come from Andrew Brackmann of William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Brackmann : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just following up on some of the questions related to advanced diagnostics from earlier. I guess it's been about a year since you guys announced that Haystack acquisition. So, can you maybe just talk about how your views on the MRD segment or that asset in particular may have evolved since then? I know you mentioned no change in dilution or spending related to it this year, but how so we'll be thinking about potential additional investments here in the future to drag some of those share wins. Thanks.\nJim Davis : Andrew, our thesis hasn't changed at all on the Haystack acquisition. The MRD market continues to grow by our estimates strong double digits. I mean, there's one primary competitor in that space today that is doing very, very well with the test and making inroads in the market, and we applaud them and they're doing terrific. So, we think having a second, third credible offering in the marketplace that has a very, very, good basis for competition, very strong and very low limits of detection. So, feel good about that test. We still feel great about the investment and where this market is going. We're going to build on that. We've launched our STEP500, assay as well that allows cancer doctors, medical oncologists to get advice from a treatment planning therapy \u2013 therapy planning standpoint. So we feel good about that. We like, by the way, on Haystack it's a tumor-informed test. Again, we feel good about the technology. As we mentioned earlier, we've signed up 20 pre-launch customers for this early experience program. These are a broad base set of customers from community-based oncologists to academic medical centers. So, we like the mix of customers that have come to us right away for this. Once we wrap this early experience program up, we'll be launching on a national basis later this year.\nSam Samad : Andrew, just to add, this is Sam from a dilution standpoint. So our expectations this year have not changed. It's still in total 35% dilution, which is $0.20 of incremental dilution versus last year. For next year, we expect less dilution from Haystack. So on a year-over-year basis, it's actually a tailwind, and then we expect to be basically to start being neutral to a creative as we look towards \u201826. So, nothing has changed from a dilution or financial expectations, and we're really thrilled about the interest in the early experience program that Jim referenced.\nOperator: And that was the final question.\nJim Davis : All right, thanks, operator. And thanks again for joining our call today. We really appreciate your continued support. Have a good day, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in the Quest Diagnostics first quarter 2024 conference call.

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. In the first quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.37 billion, up 1.5% versus the prior year, while base business revenues grew nearly 6%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were up 1.7% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong growth in our base testing revenues, partially offset by lower revenues from COVID-19 testing services. Total volume measured by the number of requisitions, increased 1.6% versus the first quarter of 2023, with acquisitions contributing 60 basis points to total volume. Total base testing volumes grew 3.3% versus the prior year, despite the impact of severe weather in the first two weeks of January. During the quarter, weather negatively impacted volume growth by approximately 30 basis points. Revenue per requisition was up slightly versus the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the number of tests per rec and favorable test mix, largely offset by lower COVID-19 testing. Base business revenue per rec was up 2.6% due to an increase in the number of tests per rec and favorable test mix. Unit price reimbursement was flat. Reported operating income in the first quarter was $300 million, or 12.7% of revenues, compared to $305 million, or 13.1% of revenues last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $349 million or 14.8% of revenues compared to $350 million or 15% of revenues last year. Adjusted operating income was relatively consistent versus the prior year due to strong growth in the base business, largely offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenues, wage increases, and higher benefit costs. Reported EPS was $1.72 in the quarter compared to $1.78 a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $2.04, flat versus the prior year. Cash from operations was $154 million in the first quarter versus $94 million in the prior year. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we repaid $300 million of senior notes which matured on April 1st. Turning to our updated full year 2024 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $9.4 billion and $9.48 billion. Reported EPS expected to be in a range of $7.57 to $7.82, and adjusted EPS to be in a range of $8.72 to $8.97. Cash from operations is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $420 million. The following are some key assumptions underlying our guidance to consider as you update your models. COVID-19 testing revenues to decline approximately $175 million for the full year. In terms of M&A, our guidance only includes acquisitions that have been announced or closed to-date. No change to our expectation for dilution from Haystack Oncology of an incremental $0.20 to adjusted EPS for the full year. Operating margin to expand for the full year driven by volume growth and improved productivity. Net interest expense to be approximately $190 million. Weighted average share count to be flat compared to the end of 2023. While we are only one quarter into the year, given the strong volume trends in Q1, we have raised our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint, which more than offsets the $0.05 to $0.07 headwind we experienced from weather in January. With that, I will now turn it back to Jim. So let me start, Ann. Thank you for the question by the way. This is Sam, and Jim if you want to add anything as well, by all means. We beat in Q1, both in terms of versus external expectations, but also versus our own internal expectations. So we came in better. We had called out at the beginning of the year on the Q4 earnings call that we expect to see a $0.05 to $0.07 headwind from weather, in terms of EPS headwind from weather. That was at the time driven by the fact that really the first two weeks, three weeks of January were quite tough for us in terms of utilization and in terms of weather. We offset a significant portion of that. I mean, you heard on the prepared remarks that we had a 30 basis point headwind impact as a result of weather, but really we offset most of the headwinds in terms of the EPS impact. So the $0.05 to $0.07, largely we feel good that that's behind us and that's essentially taken off the table. So we felt comfortable increasing our EPS by $0.10 at the midpoint. Now, we're only in the second quarter here. We still have three quarters to go. Utilization was really strong, especially base business utilization in the first quarter. We're expecting in the next three quarters that we go back to, I would say, more normal utilization, not what we saw in Q1. So that's what our EPS range is also driven by. But I would say very pleased with the beat that we had in Q1 and taking the weather headwind off the table. Yeah, just to be clear, our consistent approach is always going to be, that we will include in the guidance that we provide only the things that have been announced and our carryover acquisitions. So, anything that we haven't announced will not be included in our guidance. To Jim's point, if we do close any other transactions, we will include them in our guidance perspective going forwarded. Hey, Mike, sorry. We kind of lost you for two seconds there. Can you please repeat the question? Because I missed a portion of it. Yes, this is much better. Thank you. Yeah, I can start, and by all means, Jim you can add some color as well. I think as Jim talked about earlier, Mike, we've got some areas within advanced diagnostics that are growing in the double digits, which really helps us from growing some of the key tests that we have in that portfolio, and also helps us from profitability standpoint as well. But overall base volumes, we grew in revenues 5.7%, grew less than that in volumes in Q1. Our expectation is that we're growing in the sort of close to mid-single digits, maybe slightly below that in terms of volumes, and that drives a lot of productivity and improvement in terms of our margins as we look forward. So, both in terms of mix and some of these advanced diagnostics tests that we have, but also in terms of volume growth overall for the remaining three quarters, we expect that to drive an improvement in terms of productivity. Now remember, we are \u2013 in the next three quarters, we're not assuming that we continue at the same level and same rate of whether you call it base revenue growth and maybe to some extent base clinical volume growth. We do expect that some of this \u2013 as utilization starts to come down and normalize. Maybe that's a conservative assumption, not sure, but at this point, we're more comfortable saying that it's going to be, volume growth is going to be closer to that, just slightly lower than mid-single digits. Jim, anything you would add there? Yeah, and Jack, this is Sam. I'll mention one other thing as well. If you're looking at overall base business growth, I mean, the Quest Health Consumer-Initiated Testing business as well was a very good strength and tailwind in the quarter. Basically, that base business excluding COVID almost doubled in the quarter \u2013 year-over-year. Yeah. Hey, I'll address both. So the margins on our consumer business are consistent with the margins in the overall business. So, it's right there. It's at the meeting for the company and it continued to improve all last year and so feel good about that. In terms of the labor environment, we definitely saw a tick down or a tick up, let's just say, in our retention rates. Not yet back to pre-COVID levels, but below in the high teens, below the 20% threshold that we were running at last year. So, we feel good about that. We saw a downward tick in logistics attrition, our specimen processing. It was across the board. All front-line jobs improved in the quarter and feel good about the direction that that's moving in. And just to be clear, the cash impact is really a delay, not necessarily any impact to revenue. Yeah, I mean, I'll add maybe a couple of things. First of all, the COVID point, Michael, COVID is not really material for the rest of the year. We said for the full year, it's going to be a $175 million decline. We've had $90 million of that decline happen in Q1. So, the biggest impact really was going to be felt in Q1. But yeah, there is a price impact related to it, given the fact that \u2013 a small, minor price impact, actually, because the price went down middle of May last year. So really it's a minor price impact. Then just a little bit of color on the pricing dynamics. As Jim said, it's flattish for the full year in terms of price impact. If you look at the ingredients within that, the health plans, we expect them to be, modestly up in terms of price. The health systems is a negative impact in terms of price. Then we have some other businesses where we've had some price increases that helps. So overall, I think the net neutral in terms of price impact for the year. Andrew, just to add, this is Sam from a dilution standpoint. So our expectations this year have not changed. It's still in total 35% dilution, which is $0.20 of incremental dilution versus last year. For next year, we expect less dilution from Haystack. So on a year-over-year basis, it's actually a tailwind, and then we expect to be basically to start being neutral to a creative as we look towards \u201826. So, nothing has changed from a dilution or financial expectations, and we're really thrilled about the interest in the early experience program that Jim referenced."

            "name": "Jim Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Shawn, and good morning everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered nearly 6% base business revenue growth, continuing the strong momentum of recent quarters. We also grew total revenues for the first time since the height of the pandemic nearly three years ago. Our strong commercial focus on physicians and hospitals, combined with our broad health plan access, enabled us to take advantage of sustained high rates of healthcare utilization and drive new customer growth. Our investments in advanced diagnostics also enabled double-digit growth within multiple key clinical areas, including brain health, women's health, and advanced cardiometabolic health. In addition, our Invigorate initiative, which includes ongoing investments in automation and AI, continued to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. Given the strength of our business, we are raising our guidance for the full year. Before turning to highlights from the quarter, I'd like to briefly discuss the FDA's proposed rule to regulate laboratory-developed testing services. We still encourage the administration to withdraw the proposed rule and engage in advancing appropriate legislation that preserves the critical role of laboratory diagnostics. We are disappointed that the FDA continues to move forward with this regulation, which we believe, if enacted, will compromise patient access to critical lab testing, slow diagnostic innovation, and add unnecessary healthcare costs. We also believe that the rule raises serious legal issues, including that the FDA lacks the statutory authority to unilaterally regulate these services. While we will be prepared to comply with the rule, we will continue to work with our trade association, ACLA, on potential next steps. Now I'll recap our strategy and discuss highlights from the first quarter. Then Sam will provide detail on our financial results and talk about our updated financial guidance for 2024. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core customers, physicians, hospitals, and consumers. We enable growth across our customer channels through advanced diagnostics with an intense focus on faster-growing clinical areas, including brain health and molecular genomics and oncology. In addition, acquisitions are a key growth driver, with an emphasis on accretive hospital outreach purchases as well as smaller, independent labs. Our strategy also includes driving operational improvements across the business, with the strategic deployment of automation and AI to improve quality, service, efficiency, and the workforce experience. Here are a few key updates on the progress we've made in each of these areas. In Physician Lab Services, we delivered high single-digit based business revenue growth driven by sustained high healthcare utilization, overall market growth and share gains. This growth also reflects new customer wins and our strengthening relationships with physician practices of all sizes, including large multi-specialty physician groups and those owned by large retailers. A significant driver of our success in the physician channel is our broad health plan access, as approximately 90% of health plan members in the U.S. have access to laboratory services at Quest Diagnostics. Health Plans value our size, scale, and innovation. We partner closely with them to reduce laboratory costs through programs that redirect volume from hospital outreach labs and out-of-network labs, which often charge significantly higher prices than we do, raising healthcare costs for patients and employers. We also remain disciplined in our pricing strategy as we increase our investments in improving the customer experience, such as through digital platform enhancements and adjustments to Frontline Pay. As we highlighted previously, we successfully renegotiated our large health plan contracts that were up for renewal last year. In addition, more than 50% of our health plan revenues now have some type of value-based incentive. In Physician Services, our recent acquisition of Lenco, an independent lab in New York, also contributed to growth in the quarter. Our M&A pipeline continues to be robust, and we are making progress with several promising opportunities. In Hospital Lab Services, we grew base business revenues by mid-single digits. Hospital reference testing, in particular, continued to grow faster than pre-pandemic trends, maintaining the momentum from last year. Hospitals are sending us more reference testing, largely because of our innovation, our quality, and our value. They also face persistent challenges with staffing certain roles in specialized fields like histology, microbiology, and cytotechnology, which we can more easily fill with our talent and our technology. In general, as hospitals face both staffing and cost challenges, they continue to reevaluate their lab strategies. Additionally, as the cost of capital continues to rise, some are revisiting their investment priorities and are directing more capital into other clinical areas that generate better returns. Quest provides hospitals with a range of ways to help optimize lab operations, whether through reference testing, savings and efficiencies through professional lab services, or access to capital by selling their outreach programs. Many hospitals and health system leaders are approaching us with a heightened sense of urgency for help with their lab strategies. As a result, our pipeline of both PLS and outreach opportunities remains very strong. Consumer-initiated testing revenues grew double digits, while base business revenues nearly doubled, building on the gains that we delivered last year from our consumer-facing platform, questhealth.com. Some of our most popular test categories included general health panels, STDs, and tuberculosis testing. We also continue to expand our test menu, such as with our launch of PFAS testing for assessing potential exposure to dangerous forever chemicals, and are extending our reach through various channel partners. In Advanced Diagnostics, we generated strong double-digit revenue growth within several key clinical areas, including brain health, women's health, particularly prenatal and hereditary genetics, and advanced cardiometabolic health. Growth in brain health was driven largely by our Alzheimer's disease portfolio of tests, which includes our Quest AD-Detect blood tests for early risk assessment of Alzheimer's disease and our CSF Tests for diagnosing and monitoring. We are launching our Quest AD-Detect pTau-217 blood test to providers this week, and we intend to add additional biomarkers this year to further expand our menu. In molecular genomics and oncology, we completed the validation of our Haystack MRD test in March and have oversubscribed our Haystack MRD Early Experience Program with nearly 20 leading cancer institutions as participants. The Early Experience Program is the final step to prepare for our broad national launch of the clinical test later this year. We are also excited about the opportunities in early blood-based cancer screening. This quarter, our Lewisville, Texas site received the first specimens for the PROMIS Clinical Trial on a liquid biopsy screening test for colorectal cancer from our partner, Universal DX. We look forward to supporting Universal's efforts to gain U.S. regulatory approval for this test. Lastly, our STEP500 somatic tumor sequencing service, which helps providers select therapy for late-stage cancers based on tumor mutation profiles, is generating interest from large cancer centers. Our investments in cancer screening, treatment selection, and monitoring are positioning us to be a leader in the MRD space and other fast-growth molecular genomics and oncology markets. Turning to operational excellence, our Invigorate program aims to deliver a targeted 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements. During the quarter, we continued to deploy automation and AI to improve productivity as well as service levels and quality. For instance, we made progress creating what we term a digital front door, which will use AI in our website and service center kiosks to answer basic questions from patients, reducing workload on Phlebotomist and calls to our customer service team. We also recently automated elements of the specimen preparation process in several labs and expect to deploy these systems across other sites in 2024. These systems make our front-end operations more efficient and improve quality while also freeing our employees to focus on other value-added work. Finally, I'd like to personally thank my Quest colleagues for delivering a superior customer experience. Our industry just celebrated Lab Week, which reminds us of the key role labs play at the heart of healthcare. I'm proud that our nearly 50,000 employees bring Quest's purpose to life every day. Working together to create a healthier world, one life at a time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Sam to provide more details on our performance and our 2024 guidance. Sam? Thanks, Sam. To summarize, our business delivered strong revenue growth across our core customer channels, physicians, hospitals, and consumers, building on trends from 2023. Our strong customer relationships, broad health plan access, and investments in advanced diagnostics are enabling us to take advantage of sustained high healthcare utilization and drive new customer growth. We are steadily improving productivity as well as service levels and quality, giving us confidence in improved profitability in 2024. Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator. Yeah, sure Patrick, and good morning. So maybe the best way to look at it is think about it in terms of year-over-year. We were 14.8% operating margins in Q1 of this year compared to 15% last year. So some moving parts for you to consider and think about, because you can look at this in many different ways. But versus last year, obviously a big headwind in terms of COVID, both in terms of volumes, but also price. We had $90 million less COVID this quarter versus last year same quarter, at a much lower price as well, because we were getting reimbursed at $100 price back then. If you think about other smaller headwinds, I mean Haystack as you said, we still expect it to be $0.20 incremental dilution versus last year for the full year, well you saw that in Q1. But then offsetting these headwinds, the biggest one being COVID, was base volume growth and productivity improvement. So we actually offset almost the majority of the COVID headwind through base improvement in terms of margins. The consumer-initiated testing business also expanded operating margins as well. We continue to see great momentum in that business and good improvement in profitability. Our base gross margins actually improved quite significantly from Q1 of last year, so very encouraged by the start that we've had and the momentum that we see going forward. In terms of cadence, I think to answer your second question, it's I'd say normal seasonality that you would expect going forward. A step up in Q2 in terms of operating margins, maybe consistent operating margins to Q2 and Q3, and then a step down in Q4, which is, I would say normal pre-COVID seasonality for us. Operator, next question. Yeah. The only thing I'd add Ann, is that the volume growth was broad-based. We saw it across all physician channels and we saw it in health systems as well. So it did beat our internal expectations after a slow start in January. It came back very nicely in February and March and we finished strong. Yeah. So thanks, Kevin. So look, we don't know what the final rule is yet. We've all seen the proposed rule. It largely follows 21 CFR Part 820, which is the regulated device code. So we're preparing for it, but let me just tell you, look, we start with a strong quality management system and a very strong quality organization in Quest Diagnostics today. As you know we follow the CLIA guidelines. CLIA was implemented in 1988. It's a very robust and strict set of guidelines that we follow, and we feel good about that. I would also tell you that myself and many other people in Quest Diagnostics have come from regulated device manufacturing companies in the healthcare space, so we know what to do, we know how to do it. Certainly there's gaps between what CLIA recommends and what 21 CFR recommends, and we'll address those gaps once we know what the final rule is, but we'll be prepared. There's not going to be any impact on earnings or EPS here in 2024. As you know the timeframe laid out was a three to four year timeframe. So we'll address this in a thoughtful way. We'll be prepared, and we've got the confidence and quality organization in place to do it. Well, if we don't do any other acquisitions this year, then yes, the 50 basis point trend will continue for the following quarters. But, as we mentioned in the script, our funnel is good, it's robust and we would expect to close some additional transactions this year. But timing is involved and these things do take time. We're cautiously optimistic. Yeah. So, from an advanced diagnostic standpoint, it certainly met and even exceeded our expectations here in the quarter. So, let me talk about brain health first. The uptake of our AB 42/40 test, which is a blood-based test for amyloid plaque has again exceeded expectations. We're really, really pleased with how that test is doing. We announced yesterday in a press release that we've added a p-tau217. We had already introduced p-tau181. So we feel like the brain health blood-based portfolio is in great shape. The CSS side of the portfolio continues to do well as well. On the women's healthcare side, prenatal genetics and carrier screening are doing very well. We continue to see double-digit growth there. With respect to Haystack, as you know, it's still pre-revenue, but we are about to embark on what we call our early experience program. We said in the script that we were oversubscribed. We saw it somewhere between 15 and 20 partners to start the program with, and we filled that up a lot more quickly than we thought and had to cut it off at 20 customers. So, feel good about that. We're going to run that early experience program for the next several months, which will position us for a broader national launch later in the quarter. So, feeling good about the contribution of advanced diagnostics across our portfolio of tests. Yeah, I would just say, the mix in the quarter was really good. On a total basis, so all in, even with COVID we still had 10 basis points of growth from a rev-per-rec standpoint, pricing relatively flat. So it suggests that test-pa rec and test-mix were really, really strong. Remember, that offset, as Sam said in the script, $90 million worth of COVID decline. COVID that last year was at $100 per test. So, we completely offset that from a mix standpoint and still saw growth in rev-per-rec. So, really happy with the mix that we saw in the quarter. I think it's all of the above, Jack. Certainly, the utilization remains strong, consistent with what we've seen in the last three or four quarters. But, we also said that, yeah, we think we're picking up share. We closed several large transactions with two integrated large physician groups in the quarter. Our core physician volume growth was strong. Our hospital reference growth was strong. Our PLS volume relatively strong in the quarter. So, that suggests utilization in hospitals was also up, and our pathology business contributing as well to growth. So, we see it across all physician types, all physician channels, retailers, as well as these large physician groups. It's a combination of utilization plus share gain. Yeah. So we call it value-based incentives is what we're talking about here. Generally there is two types. So, one is related to acquisitions. So when we acquire an outreach book of business, and let's say the health plan was paying that health system 200% to 300% of Medicare, it is not going to come down to the rates that we are contracted with that health plan with on day one. It will step down over time. In fact, there's \u2013 again, since it doesn't step right down to our rate, we're getting paid a higher price for that work over some period of time. The second incentive types are broad-based or types of incentives are really related to volume movement. So, movement of high-priced requisitions from health system laboratories or from out-of-network laboratories into Quest Diagnostics. In essence, you're getting paid for share gains at that health plan that are tied to share gains coming from, moving those requisitions from, again, health systems and out-of-network labs. So, really those are the two types of value incentives that we get. No, less than 2% of our requisitions were ever moving through those pipes from an adjudication standpoint. There's somewhere between a $15 million and $20 million cash impact, but no revenue impact in the quarter. Yeah, so let me start and then I'll let Sam make some comments. So, remember, in the rev-rec calculation, there's multiple moving parts here. The first one is pure price. We said it was flat in the quarter and we expected to be flattish for the rest of the year. We also said in the rev-rec calculation is test-per-rec \u2013 test-per-rec, test-mix, and then payer-mix. Test-per-rec, positive in the quarter, we expect that to continue. Test-mix was favorable in the quarter. We expect that to continue. So all told, we like the trend that we saw in the first quarter. Now, there's always puts and takes as we move through each quarter and, we'll have to see how it plays out. But Sam, do you? Well, Stephanie, we've always said that about 50% of the cost structure in the company is wages, labor and within the laboratories, it's obviously higher than that. Within the Phlebotomy, it's mostly a people expense, although there's supplies and rent for our patient service centers. I would say in the laboratories, much of the automation efforts continue in the specimen processing area, what we call sorting, aliquoting, pouring off tubes of urine, and things like that. That's where our automation efforts continue to pay dividends for us. On the Phlebotomy side, as I mentioned, yes, it's a highly labor-intensive operation. Now, in a typical 10 to 12 minute draw time, there's still probably five to six minutes of that time doing manual paperwork, computer entry type of stuff. The biggest opportunity there to improve that is still the movement from paper requisitions to electronic requisitions. What still comes into our patient service center today is 35% to 45% paper that we end up having to input that information into our Quest system. So we work back through the physician offices that send us that paper and try to convert that. I would tell you also, we're working on some other kits that could allow for some self-draw. So these are early stages, early stage development. But, we continue to work on some other things that should make our Phlebotomy staff even more productive. Andrew, our thesis hasn't changed at all on the Haystack acquisition. The MRD market continues to grow by our estimates strong double digits. I mean, there's one primary competitor in that space today that is doing very, very well with the test and making inroads in the market, and we applaud them and they're doing terrific. So, we think having a second, third credible offering in the marketplace that has a very, very, good basis for competition, very strong and very low limits of detection. So, feel good about that test. We still feel great about the investment and where this market is going. We're going to build on that. We've launched our STEP500, assay as well that allows cancer doctors, medical oncologists to get advice from a treatment planning therapy \u2013 therapy planning standpoint. So we feel good about that. We like, by the way, on Haystack it's a tumor-informed test. Again, we feel good about the technology. As we mentioned earlier, we've signed up 20 pre-launch customers for this early experience program. These are a broad base set of customers from community-based oncologists to academic medical centers. So, we like the mix of customers that have come to us right away for this. Once we wrap this early experience program up, we'll be launching on a national basis later this year. All right, thanks, operator. And thanks again for joining our call today. We really appreciate your continued support. Have a good day, everyone."
